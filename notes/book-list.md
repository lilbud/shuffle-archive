## Intro
List of possible books to be generated by this project.

- Kingdom of Days: 1 book per month
- Cover Me: 1 big book
- Roll of the Dice: 1 big book

KoD:
    Book per month, breaks things up nicer
    add in "Where the Band Was" bits when relevant

Cover Me:
    Being one big book works better. Could do themes, but those would run out quickly.
    Also include Meeting Across The River (Colabs with artists on their songs)

Roll of the Dice:
    One big book, songs ordered alphabetically
    Could do albums, or chapter by album?
    Or maybe songs ordered chronologically?

## Other Categories
There are other categories listed on the site. Those are as follows.

### Hearts of Stone
Only one post, an april fools day post looking at the Bruce Springstone parody. Not sure where to put this. Maybe an "odds and ends" section? Could include with "Spare Parts".

### Spare Parts
These are assorted posts not fitting with other categories

### Uncategorized
Assorted posts, usually having to do with the blog itself.

### LA 83, Once Only, Letter, Holiday, Tunnel, Greetings, Encore
New categories only for the purposes of the corresponding books. Will be checked but likely they are posts that exist already.

# All Books
- Make sure links are updated to point to book itself, rather than the site. If another book, then update to say that.
- External links are correct, point to IA if not.
- Youtube/Videopress: Videos can be embedded, maybe add a description saying what the video is. Already replaced embeds with direct links.
- Audio: Perhaps upload audio to IA, and link to that. If not, add description like above.
- Images: can be embedded, maybe resized if needed.
