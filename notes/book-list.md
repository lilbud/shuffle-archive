# Intro
List of possible books to be generated by this project.

Kingdom of Days: 12
Roll of the Dice (originals): 587 posts
Cover Me (cover songs): 967 posts

Kingdom of Days will be 1 book per calendar month

Roll of the Dice will likely be broken up by studio album, including outtakes. Likely do a single book on Tracks and Tracks 2 depending on how much Ken wrote. Then maybe a book for the "unreleased" songs.

Cover Me is trickier, simply due to amount of posts. So far only two books have been announced:
- Encore (cover songs in the encore, or ones best known by that.)
- One Time Only (one off covers)
