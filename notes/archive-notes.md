## Notes

See `report.txt` for a count of posts each day, along with every time the script was run. The post deletion started around early December when the first books finished being delivered. The posts deleted were those for Greetings, Christmas songs, and the first batch of Cover Me entries.

Posts *are* actively being deleted as we inch closer to the January 5th shutdown date. Nothing new will be added after this date, but posts will continue to disappear until the site completely disappears in 2027/28. The `report.txt` file shows this, starting at 2075 posts on Nov 30, then slowly dwindling over the course of December, with the current count as of writing on 12/27 being 1969 posts.

Even worse, many posts are being "mangled". At best, their formatting is a tad screwed up. At worst, the content of these posts is being completely replaced while keeping the same URL. This makes archiving much harder than it should be. If I didn't start archiving posts when I did, well over 100 posts would be gone forever. I expect this pattern to continue.
