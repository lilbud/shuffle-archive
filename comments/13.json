I appreciate the coincidental timing of this post featuring the late, great Jimmy Lafave. May 19th will by me and my wife\u2019s 20th wedding anniversary. Our wedding song was \u201cIf I Should Fall Behind\u201d and our 1st dance was to Jimmy\u2019s \u201c Only One Angel\u201d. We were lucky enough to see him perform many shows in Austin and San Antonio over the years. I look forward to you posting about his various covers of Bruce\u2019s songs. His cover of LOHAD is one of my favorite covers ever. He was also a great interpreter of Bob Dylan songs as well as a fine songwriter himself. Sadly, the other coincidence is this week (May 21) will be the fourth anniversary of his passing. May he Rest In Peace. He will never be forgotten in our household\u2026</p>\n"}, "link": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/05/17/matr-bruce-springsteen-arlo-guthrie-joe-ely-and-jimmy-lafave-oklahoma-hills/#comment-1525", "status": "approved", "type": "comment", "author_avatar_urls": {"24": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/9efc659d055afb0d359cba0ae6e654b068c2c70f18543b2a6f50b3e5a1748a6d?s=24&d=mm&r=g", "48": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/9efc659d055afb0d359cba0ae6e654b068c2c70f18543b2a6f50b3e5a1748a6d?s=48&d=mm&r=g", "96": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/9efc659d055afb0d359cba0ae6e654b068c2c70f18543b2a6f50b3e5a1748a6d?s=96&d=mm&r=g"}, "meta": {"_wp_note_status": null}, "_links": {"self": [{"href": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/comments/1525", "targetHints": {"allow": ["GET"]}}], "collection": [{"href": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/comments"}], "up": [{"embeddable": true, "post_type": "post", "href": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/26871"}]}}, {"id": 1524, "post": 26708, "parent": 0, "author": 0, "author_name": "Paul Carroll, Garland, Texas", "author_url": "", "date": "2021-05-16T12:04:56", "date_gmt": "2021-05-16T19:04:56", "content": {"rendered": "<p>Love your interpretation!</p>\n<p>The first word of the song is the key: Remember.<br />\nThe song is the stream-of-conscience thoughts of a soldier, his love, and maybe<br />\nhis brother in arms.<br />\nFlashing scenes of memories from before, during, and after the violence of war.<br />\nIt&#8217;s an evil game, a devils&#8217;

(Can these, too, be called &#8220;houses of a thousand guitars&#8221;?) </p>\n<p>This idea is also included in the video of &#8220;Turn, Turn, Turn&#8221; (KOD, 4.23.08) in which Bruce and Roger McGuinn remind us there IS &#8220;a time to laugh, a time to weep&#8221;, &#8220;a time to build up, a time to break down&#8221;, &#8220;a time to dance, a time to mourn&#8221;, &#8220;a time to cast away stones, a time to gather stones together&#8221;&#8230;and &#8220;a time to every purpose under heaven.&#8221; Just beautiful.</p>\n<p>Thanks for helping to find some clarity to a personal quandary and for your work on this fantastic &#8220;Roll&#8221;.</p>\n"}, "link": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2017/01/08/roll-of-the-dice-house-of-a-thousand-guitars/#comment-1459", "status": "approved", "type": "comment", "author_avatar_urls": {"24": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d86cae6eb78f0ee785dcdd4fe6583d5b0fc77235226f1ef74e1c665039a23641?s=24&d=mm&r=g", "48": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d86cae6eb78f0ee785dcdd4fe6583d5b0fc77235226f1ef74e1c665039a23641?s=48&d=mm&r=g", "96": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d86cae6eb78f0ee785dcdd4fe6583d5b0fc77235226f1ef74e1c665039a23641?s=96&d=mm&r=g"}, "meta": {"_wp_note_status": null}, "_links": {"self": [{"href": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/comments/1459", "targetHints": {"allow": ["GET"]}}], "collection": [{"href": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/comments"}], "up": [{"embeddable": true, "post_type": "post", "href": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/24642"}]}}, {"id": 1458, "post": 24642, "parent": 1457, "author": 1, "author_name": "Ken", "author_url": "", "date": "2021-04-24T08:22:10", "date_gmt": "2021-04-24T15:22:10", "content": {"rendered": "<p>Thanks for reading, Cynthia!

In my opinion, this is one of his best written and composed songs, and if you use &#8220;Hello Sunshine&#8221; as its anecdote, it better expresses my interpretation of it. Replace &#8220;darkness on the edge of town&#8221; with &#8220;my depression&#8221; and it makes more sense. The line &#8220;fall in love with lonely, you end up that way&#8221; is, to me, a reference to the character of this song &#8220;wanting things that can only be found in the darkness on the edge of town.&#8221; After all, he &#8220;always loved a lonely town&#8230;&#8221; The &#8220;hill&#8221; in Darkness is the tipping point for the depressed character of the song, and I&#8217;d argue that post-88 the final stanza took on a more optimistic tone in concert. Perhaps that&#8217;s intentional, when considering Bruce&#8217;s own depression. When interpreting the final stanza as a character that&#8217;s overcome the depressive episode that accompanies, it more-so aligns with &#8220;The Promise&#8221; and &#8220;Hello Sunshine&#8221; than anything else. In other words, &#8220;I&#8217;m at the tipping point right now, but I wont stop trying to better myself, because I still have that lingering sense of depression seeping into what I&#8217;m doing.&#8221;</p>\n"}, "link": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/04/10/roll-of-the-dice-darkness-on-the-edge-of-town/#comment-1451", "status": "approved", "type": "comment", "author_avatar_urls": {"24": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/9184504be5a87f3f115a4aa34b55d07fa024bbdf45d8587d891d44ed728f1a8b?s=24&d=mm&r=g", "48": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/9184504be5a87f3f115a4aa34b55d07fa024bbdf45d8587d891d44ed728f1a8b?s=48&d=mm&r=g", "96": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/9184504be5a87f3f115a4aa34b55d07fa024bbdf45d8587d891d44ed728f1a8b?s=96&d=mm&r=g"}, "meta": {"_wp_note_status": null}, "_links": {"self": [{"href": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/comments/1451", "targetHints": {"allow": ["GET"]}}], "collection": [{"href": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/comments"}], "up": [{"embeddable": true, "post_type": "post", "href": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/1469"}], "children": [{"embeddable": true, "href": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/comments?parent=1451"}]}}, {"id": 1450, "post": 1019, "parent": 1447, "author": 1, "author_name": "Ken", "author_url": "", "date": "2021-04-23T20:26:22", "date_gmt": "2021-04-24T03:26:22", "content": {"rendered": "<p>Oh, it was definitely a car crash, I certainly didn\u2019t mean to imply otherwise, just that it\u2019s uncertain whether it was a fatal one.</p>\n"}, "link": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/03/23/roll-of-the-dice-highway-29/#comment-1450", "status": "approved", "type": "comment", "author_avatar_urls": {"24": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d037d3a05b6c9e4ee09ccdf24f113649cbc6f244d3e0a5706ee0a42186f079dc?s=24&d=mm&r=g", "48": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d037d3a05b6c9e4ee09ccdf24f113649cbc6f244d3e0a5706ee0a42186f079dc?s=48&d=mm&r=g", "96": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d037d3a05b6c9e4ee09ccdf24f113649cbc6f244d3e0a5706ee0a42186f079dc?s=96&d=mm&r=g"}, "meta": {"_wp_note_status": null}, "_links": {"self": [{"href": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/comments/1450", "targetHints": {"allow": ["GET"]}}], "collection": [{"href": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/comments"}], "author": [{"embeddable": true, "href": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/users/1"}], "up": [{"embeddable": true, "post_type": "post", "href": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/1019"}], "in-reply-to": [{"embeddable": true, "href": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/comments/1447"}], "children": [{"embeddable": true, "href": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/comments?parent=1450"}]}}, {"id": 1449, "post": 24642, "parent": 0, "author": 0, "author_name": "Ben", "author_url": "", "date": "2021-04-23T20:23:26", "date_gmt": "2021-04-24T03:23:26", "content": {"rendered": "<p>This was always my least favorite song off the album until I saw the accompanying film&#8230; this is a song that BELONGS to the E Street Band, and something about seeing them playing it live made the song &#8220;click&#8221; for me.

Point taken about these songs being &#8220;perfectly conceived in the studio&#8221;. Spot on. But I&#8217;m left curious as to how these songs would translate to the stage. The last time I was curious about how an album would come across live was Working on a Dream. Needless to say, they did not work well live, as Bruce quickly realized. When Magic was released, I KNEW those songs would sound great on tour. And I was not disappointed. I am not calling WS another Magic, but I wonder what Bruce could do for The Wayfarer or Drive Fast live.
