I listened to &#8220;my fathers house&#8221; in our backyard while waiting for my brother to come to the facility so that we could tell her (me on Facetime because of covid fears of flying at that point) that my Dad in the bed next to hers was now no longer.

July 9 would have been their 60th anniversary so they almost got there.  I had a similar relationship with my father as you described yours.  He was a kind man and did lots for others but was very evangelical religious and me not so much and he could never get past that.  Dad taught me a lot by how he handled situations and I like to think that he enjoyed life more than he showed.

I truly appreciate what you&#8217;ve written and what Bruce is trying to do with this song. In this case, however, I think there is a wide gap between the idea/sentiment and the execution. In my opinion, the flaws of the song outweigh and overtake the message. </p>\n<p>Musically, I hear Arthur&#8217;s Theme by Christopher Cross. There&#8217;s a comparison I never thought I&#8217;d make, but the opening of both songs are very, very similar. I try to ignore this but it&#8217;s too strong.</p>\n<p>The lyrics are strong, as you describe. But the line itself: &#8220;house of a thousand guitars&#8221; &#8211; it lands with a thud. I don&#8217;t know what the problem is, exactly. It&#8217;s like it has too many syllables squeezed into too small a space, and the sounds are too dissimilar to work well together. To my ears, that line sounds forced and awkward every time he sings it. And again to my ears, it&#8217;s just not a meaningful or poetic line. It means nothing and is the worst line in the song. </p>\n<p>And he sings it over and over again. I truly love Bruce&#8217;s music from the last 20 years, but when it&#8217;s not strong it often has the same flaw: an over reliance on one lyric. Songs like Surprise, Surprise or Working on a Dream, or Letter to You (but I agree with you about the acoustic version) and House of a Thousand Guitars &#8211; go back to the same repeated piece of melody and lyric over and over again and just beat you over the head. At least that&#8217;s what they do to me.</p>\n<p>House of a Thousand Guitars has grown on me since I first heard it, but if I&#8217;m honest it makes me cringe a bit every time I hear it, and every time I hear Bruce sing that clunky lyric over and over and over again.</p>\n<p>Thanks again for your analysis and the time and energy you&#8217;ve put into this site.</p>\n"}, "link": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2017/01/08/roll-of-the-dice-house-of-a-thousand-guitars/#comment-1740", "status": "approved", "type": "comment", "author_avatar_urls": {"24": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4bdb71c041bc51d5d6dc55f6650bd9dc46e26c55b06aa7e13cbe5cffc592a116?s=24&d=mm&r=g", "48": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4bdb71c041bc51d5d6dc55f6650bd9dc46e26c55b06aa7e13cbe5cffc592a116?s=48&d=mm&r=g", "96": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4bdb71c041bc51d5d6dc55f6650bd9dc46e26c55b06aa7e13cbe5cffc592a116?s=96&d=mm&r=g"}, "meta": {"_wp_note_status": null}, "_links": {"self": [{"href": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/comments/1740", "targetHints": {"allow": ["GET"]}}], "collection": [{"href": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/comments"}], "up": [{"embeddable": true, "post_type": "post", "href": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/24642"}], "children": [{"embeddable": true, "href": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/comments?parent=1740"}]}}, {"id": 1737, "post": 28857, "parent": 1736, "author": 1, "author_name": "Ken", "author_url": "", "date": "2021-08-15T04:20:21", "date_gmt": "2021-08-15T11:20:21", "content": {"rendered": "<p>Danke!</p>\n"}, "link": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/08/13/roll-of-the-dice-my-fathers-house/#comment-1737", "status": "approved", "type": "comment", "author_avatar_urls": {"24": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d037d3a05b6c9e4ee09ccdf24f113649cbc6f244d3e0a5706ee0a42186f079dc?s=24&d=mm&r=g", "48": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d037d3a05b6c9e4ee09ccdf24f113649cbc6f244d3e0a5706ee0a42186f079dc?s=48&d=mm&r=g", "96": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d037d3a05b6c9e4ee09ccdf24f113649cbc6f244d3e0a5706ee0a42186f079dc?s=96&d=mm&r=g"}, "meta": {"_wp_note_status": null}, "_links": {"self": [{"href": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/comments/1737", "targetHints": {"allow": ["GET"]}}], "collection": [{"href": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/comments"}], "author": [{"embeddable": true, "href": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/users/1"}], "up": [{"embeddable": true, "post_type": "post", "href": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/28857"}], "in-reply-to": [{"embeddable": true, "href": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/comments/1736"}]}}, {"id": 1736, "post": 28857, "parent": 0, "author": 0, "author_name": "Martin", "author_url": "", "date": "2021-08-15T04:13:20", "date_gmt": "2021-08-15T11:13:20", "content": {"rendered": "<p>War sehr ergriffen von Deinem Beitrag und kenne \u00e4hnliche Situationen.

My Dad passed at 53. I was 19. I am nearly 72 and think about him pretty much every day, as well as all the lost opportunities to spend time together. My son &amp; I will be seeing Bruce in NYC in a few weeks. We are  fortunate to have had a good relationship. Best wishes to you and family.</p>\n"}, "link": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/08/13/roll-of-the-dice-my-fathers-house/#comment-1721", "status": "approved", "type": "comment", "author_avatar_urls": {"24": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6621a2d8420701b87ba3724f435bdd07c6b5660b92deb03f4f593cddfcc78ba3?s=24&d=mm&r=g", "48": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6621a2d8420701b87ba3724f435bdd07c6b5660b92deb03f4f593cddfcc78ba3?s=48&d=mm&r=g", "96": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6621a2d8420701b87ba3724f435bdd07c6b5660b92deb03f4f593cddfcc78ba3?s=96&d=mm&r=g"}, "meta": {"_wp_note_status": null}, "_links": {"self": [{"href": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/comments/1721", "targetHints": {"allow": ["GET"]}}], "collection": [{"href": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/comments"}], "up": [{"embeddable": true, "post_type": "post", "href": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/28857"}]}}, {"id": 1720, "post": 28857, "parent": 0, "author": 0, "author_name": "Steve Baker", "author_url": "", "date": "2021-08-13T08:10:04", "date_gmt": "2021-08-13T15:10:04", "content": {"rendered": "<p>Ken<br />\nI have always found your posts engaging.
