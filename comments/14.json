And I guess I like the idea of the chorus and the verses running on parallel tracks but then meeting up at the end of the song; you keep hearing the invitation (or the plea) in the chorus, but you don&#8217;t know who it&#8217;s to until the very end.

Yeah, the verses are kind of boring and there are too many of them; he could have cut this down and made it better, but that chorus! That wistful, tugging riff! So good! I think he was going for something similar to John Prine&#8217;s &#8220;Six O&#8217;Clock News,&#8221; if you  know that song? It tells this kid&#8217;s whole life story, from his birth to his death by suicide, and the chorus is just &#8220;Come on baby, spend the night with me&#8221; &#8211; this need for human closeness juxtaposed against a rapidly darkening background. This doesn&#8217;t work as well as &#8220;Six O&#8217;Clock News,&#8221; imo, because the verses don&#8217;t stand up to the chorus, but it&#8217;s still one of my favorite Springsteen outtakes.</p>\n<p>One thing I noticed about that last verse you quoted &#8211; &#8220;Rich man want the power and the seat on the top/ poor man want the money that the rich man got/ honey tonight I&#8217;m feeling so tired and unsure / Come on in Mary, shut the light, close the door&#8221; &#8211; is that it is almost identical to a verse from &#8220;Badlands,&#8221; but with the tape run in reverse. Instead of &#8220;Poor man wanna be rich/ rich man wanna be king&#8221; and then the narrator swaggering confidently out into the night to &#8220;find out what I got,&#8221; we end with the narrator, overwhelmed, retreating into a closed room and the comfort of another person. Which, of course, makes this yet another of Bruce&#8217;s classic &#8220;the world is terrible so let&#8217;s have sex&#8221; songs that never made it to an album.</p>\n"}, "link": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/03/15/roll-of-the-dice-rockaway-the-days/#comment-1333", "status": "approved", "type": "comment", "author_avatar_urls": {"24": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e96ce5e191597d2a7261f90e6c3811eaf0d0b494cb629180605de4b8cf55bcd1?s=24&d=mm&r=g", "48": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e96ce5e191597d2a7261f90e6c3811eaf0d0b494cb629180605de4b8cf55bcd1?s=48&d=mm&r=g", "96": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e96ce5e191597d2a7261f90e6c3811eaf0d0b494cb629180605de4b8cf55bcd1?s=96&d=mm&r=g"}, "meta": {"_wp_note_status": null}, "_links": {"self": [{"href": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/comments/1333", "targetHints": {"allow": ["GET"]}}], "collection": [{"href": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/comments"}], "up": [{"embeddable": true, "post_type": "post", "href": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/25700"}], "children": [{"embeddable": true, "href": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/comments?parent=1333"}]}}, {"id": 1327, "post": 24474, "parent": 1326, "author": 0, "author_name": "Scott P.

The house still stands, and is a two story colonial in a subdivision not far from where I live here in Louisville, Kentucky. My dad and I actually drove by it the other night, and we commented on it, because we remember the entire event. The house isn&#8217;t pink anymore and I&#8217;m sure has been sold in the 30 plus years, but it remained a pale Cadillac pink for years. I remember as a kid us driving through the subdivision to look at it. My dad grew up in the area, just down the street from where it is. </p>\n<p>I was a little kid in the mid-80&#8217;s and my parents in their late 20&#8217;s when the promo was going on, but to this day he and I still remember it. From the promos on tv, to remembering the house being built and painted pink for the promotion. I don&#8217;t know if the house was built specifically for the promo (it&#8217;s in an established neighborhood in Prospect; which is a suburb area in the eastern part of the county), or if it was just a new build and was purchased for this auction to raise money. (I&#8217;m guessing for FarmAid.) But we remember it being so weird a house was being auctioned off related to this song, and it was in our town. But John is from Seymour, Indiana; which isn&#8217;t far from Louisville. Back before he hit it big, John and his first wife actually lived in Louisville for several years while he worked for the local power company, LG&amp;E. He wrote a song about it, and how incredibly hard it was for them during that time. The song is called Empty Hands, from his Lonesome Jubilee album.</p>\n"}, "link": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/03/11/matr-john-mellancamp-and-bruce-springsteen-pink-houses/#comment-1325", "status": "approved", "type": "comment", "author_avatar_urls": {"24": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7cbc86697eebd297f3533650222b6100c008b872957bff61fbdd7bd3d3399bc5?s=24&d=mm&r=g", "48": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7cbc86697eebd297f3533650222b6100c008b872957bff61fbdd7bd3d3399bc5?s=48&d=mm&r=g", "96": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7cbc86697eebd297f3533650222b6100c008b872957bff61fbdd7bd3d3399bc5?s=96&d=mm&r=g"}, "meta": {"_wp_note_status": null}, "_links": {"self": [{"href": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/comments/1325", "targetHints": {"allow": ["GET"]}}], "collection": [{"href": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/comments"}], "up": [{"embeddable": true, "post_type": "post", "href": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/24474"}], "children": [{"embeddable": true, "href": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/comments?parent=1325"}]}}, {"id": 1322, "post": 24474, "parent": 0, "author": 0, "author_name": "Mark J.

The tickets were very expensive. I had a seat right next to the side of the stage. A funny story: when Bruce ran to the 2nd stage in the middle of the arena, he overshot it because the arena was so small! He raced to the back of the arena and then blamed it on Jake who was following him! He commented on how small the arena was! The tickets were close to $200 USD each. Which was not something people in Chile could easily afford. The whole back of the arena seats were empty.

Thanks Ken, that was great!</p>\n"}, "link": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/01/28/cover-me-gary-u-s-bonds-hold-on-to-what-you-got/#comment-1234", "status": "approved", "type": "comment", "author_avatar_urls": {"24": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/9efc659d055afb0d359cba0ae6e654b068c2c70f18543b2a6f50b3e5a1748a6d?s=24&d=mm&r=g", "48": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/9efc659d055afb0d359cba0ae6e654b068c2c70f18543b2a6f50b3e5a1748a6d?s=48&d=mm&r=g", "96": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/9efc659d055afb0d359cba0ae6e654b068c2c70f18543b2a6f50b3e5a1748a6d?s=96&d=mm&r=g"}, "meta": {"_wp_note_status": null}, "_links": {"self": [{"href": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/comments/1234", "targetHints": {"allow": ["GET"]}}], "collection": [{"href": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/comments"}], "up": [{"embeddable": true, "post_type": "post", "href": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/24473"}]}}, {"id": 1231, "post": 24640, "parent": 0, "author": 0, "author_name": "Samuel Figg", "author_url": "", "date": "2021-01-27T05:13:12", "date_gmt": "2021-01-27T13:13:12", "content": {"rendered": "<p>Saw the 1st time of froggie.

I agree that the theme can lead to great songs, as Bruce previously and subsequently illustrated, I just feel that Bruce was kind lazy with this one. </p>\n<p>I suspect that since wrote it for a disco artist, he assumed that the lyrics were less important than the riff and the beat.

I like Cover Me! I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s perfect &#8211; that repetitive riff wears on me, and I really hate the way he plays it live &#8211; but I think it&#8217;s an important song and a meaningful one.</p>\n<p>Mostly, that&#8217;s because I think &#8220;the world sucks, so let&#8217;s have sex&#8221; is a very powerful theme for a song, and particularly for a Bruce song. The idea of sex as a form of protection, a form of safe space, is a motif that comes up again and again in Bruce&#8217;s songs, but mostly in outtakes. A terrible, frightening, oppressive world, the realities of the time you live in pressing in all around you, and the man admitting to being overwhelmed by it and asking a woman for comfort and protection through sex &#8211; that&#8217;s something Bruce tried to write a few times, starting with his version of &#8220;Because the Night,&#8221; which places a lot more emphasis on &#8220;they can&#8217;t hurt us now&#8221; than you&#8217;d know from Patti Smith&#8217;s lyrics, and going on through &#8220;Burnin&#8217; Train.&#8221; &#8220;Cover Me&#8221; was the first one to make it to an album, though, and the only one to do so for a long time. I suspect the vulnerability of that kind of story, the way it undercuts traditional gender roles and ideas about who gets to be the strong one in a relationship, was difficult for Bruce, even as it clearly appealed to him as a theme.</p>\n<p>I also think the anonymous quality of &#8220;Cover Me&#8221; works very well with the rest of Born in the USA, which (apart from My Hometown) is very much about fractured, incomplete relationships: one-night stands, casual flings, fading friendships. There&#8217;s a real sense of &#8220;this isn&#8217;t much, but it&#8217;s better than nothing&#8221; about the connections with other people that come into BITUSA, and I think Cover Me is an important part of that.</p>\n<p>And, of course, there&#8217;s the fun detail that &#8220;Cover Me&#8221; is clearly written for a woman, complete with sexual double meanings. &#8220;Looking for a lover who will come on in and cover me?&#8221; I MEAN. And Bruce doesn&#8217;t bother to change that lyric (though he does on Drop on Down), thus making it one of the gayer songs on an album that also features Bobby Jean and No Surrender.</p>\n<p>All that said, do I like &#8220;Drop on Down&#8221; better? Probably, yeah. I&#8217;m obsessed with the BITUSA outtakes, with those ghostly, weary vocals and the open depression in the lyrics. But I think &#8220;Cover Me&#8221; works better for the overall feel of BITUSA. Everything in BITUSA is wearing some kind of disguise; either the dark lyrics are hiding behind the fun arena rock, or the fun arena rock is fighting against the loneliness of the lyrics, depending on how you look at it. Something as nakedly unhappy as &#8220;Drop on Down&#8221; wouldn&#8217;t quite fit, I think, but I do love it and I hope it comes out on Tracks II.</p>\n<p>Sorry for writing a whole essay!</p>\n"}, "link": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/01/13/roll-of-the-dice-cover-me/#comment-1189", "status": "approved", "type": "comment", "author_avatar_urls": {"24": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e96ce5e191597d2a7261f90e6c3811eaf0d0b494cb629180605de4b8cf55bcd1?s=24&d=mm&r=g", "48": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e96ce5e191597d2a7261f90e6c3811eaf0d0b494cb629180605de4b8cf55bcd1?s=48&d=mm&r=g", "96": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e96ce5e191597d2a7261f90e6c3811eaf0d0b494cb629180605de4b8cf55bcd1?s=96&d=mm&r=g"}, "meta": {"_wp_note_status": null}, "_links": {"self": [{"href": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/comments/1189", "targetHints": {"allow": ["GET"]}}], "collection": [{"href": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/comments"}], "up": [{"embeddable": true, "post_type": "post", "href": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/23943"}], "children": [{"embeddable": true, "href": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/comments?parent=1189"}]}}]
