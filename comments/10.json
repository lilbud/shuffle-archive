It&#8217;s a song from one friend to one other, incredibly intimate.<br />\nThey may be the same chords and the same lyrics, but they are such different emotional perspectives.<br />\nI always recommend listening to the 1984-08-20 Drift Away, with Steve singing, &#8220;Thanks for the 20 years you&#8217;ve given me,&#8221; followed by the 1984-11-04 version of No Surrender from the final night in LA.<br />\nIn the Drift Away we hear Steve&#8217;s love for his friend of 20 years &#8211; more than half their years on Earth at that point.

Steve had so much input into Bruce&#8217;s music, especially with The River and BITUSA albums, and Bruce was at a pinnacle of public popularity one could only imagine. Yet he was without maybe the most important friend he had. Your heart aches with Bruce. It is the perfect complement to Drift Away from 11 weeks earlier.<br />\nThe Drift Away (official version) is widely available on Youtube.

The first is a mother who is also a suicide bomber &#8211; we know she&#8217;s a mother because of the motherly reference to the school pack. A man wouldn&#8217;t be referenced this way. She is from the middle east &#8211; as referenced by the black river, i.e. oil. Check out &#8216;Seeds&#8217; and &#8216;Goodeye&#8217; for a similar reference to oil (and therefore money/riches/dreams/reason for war etc)</p>\n<p>The suicide bomber carries out her role thinking this will take her to paradise. she might be right &#8211; what do we know.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, in Virginia, lives another woman who has lost her lover/partner/husband and longs to find them again in Paradise. Given this song is from &#8216;The Rising&#8217; you could read that the second woman lost her soulmate to an act of terrorism which emphasises the parallel stories or draws out some irony perhaps? One&#8217;s suicide is an act of terror the others&#8217; is because of an act of terror.</p>\n<p>Anyhow, the second woman, whilst trying to drown herself realises that actually the paradise she seeks probably doesn&#8217;t exist, so she doesn&#8217;t actually carry out the act.</p>\n<p>This is a big statement. On the one hand we have a woman placed in the middle east who is convinced that her act of terrorism will give her rites to paradise. She does this whilst knowing she will be leaving behind her child &#8211; that&#8217;s how convinced she is that her Paradise awaits her. On the other hand we have a woman who is willing to end her life because she feels so cheated by life that she&#8217;d rather give hers up if there&#8217;s a chance to be with her partner again.</p>\n<p>The last two lines of the song, to come after the last chorus, leave a very poignant end to a very simple but incredibly deep meaning song. I play it a lot because of the many levels the song reaches &#8211; it&#8217;s an absolute fab song &#8211; my wife just thinks the song is slow, dull and crap.</p>\n<p>What does she know eh!</p>\n"}, "link": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/01/07/roll-of-the-dice-paradise/#comment-1964", "status": "approved", "type": "comment", "author_avatar_urls": {"24": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5271132b21aa75c8785e496f4ad8ada7a7f7982dcf18f8115cab46d78cbc57b8?s=24&d=mm&r=g", "48": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5271132b21aa75c8785e496f4ad8ada7a7f7982dcf18f8115cab46d78cbc57b8?s=48&d=mm&r=g", "96": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5271132b21aa75c8785e496f4ad8ada7a7f7982dcf18f8115cab46d78cbc57b8?s=96&d=mm&r=g"}, "meta": {"_wp_note_status": null}, "_links": {"self": [{"href": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/comments/1964", "targetHints": {"allow": ["GET"]}}], "collection": [{"href": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/comments"}], "up": [{"embeddable": true, "post_type": "post", "href": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/127"}]}}, {"id": 1963, "post": 23950, "parent": 1961, "author": 0, "author_name": "P P J", "author_url": "", "date": "2021-11-08T03:22:03", "date_gmt": "2021-11-08T11:22:03", "content": {"rendered": "<p>Admittedly, \u201di\u2019ll keep you in my heart\u201d is the first line of the chorus \u2014 but at this point still a verse away.</p>\n"}, "link": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/01/17/roll-of-the-dice-drive-fast-the-stuntman/#comment-1963", "status": "approved", "type": "comment", "author_avatar_urls": {"24": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/409f09be8fc620982ee95e2a0a693add2368af9f98c3a795b5dc40da31a41f74?s=24&d=mm&r=g", "48": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/409f09be8fc620982ee95e2a0a693add2368af9f98c3a795b5dc40da31a41f74?s=48&d=mm&r=g", "96": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/409f09be8fc620982ee95e2a0a693add2368af9f98c3a795b5dc40da31a41f74?s=96&d=mm&r=g"}, "meta": {"_wp_note_status": null}, "_links": {"self": [{"href": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/comments/1963", "targetHints": {"allow": ["GET"]}}], "collection": [{"href": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/comments"}], "up": [{"embeddable": true, "post_type": "post", "href": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/23950"}], "in-reply-to": [{"embeddable": true, "href": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/comments/1961"}]}}, {"id": 1962, "post": 23950, "parent": 1961, "author": 0, "author_name": "P P J", "author_url": "", "date": "2021-11-08T03:15:51", "date_gmt": "2021-11-08T11:15:51", "content": {"rendered": "<p>Okay. \ud83d\ude09<br />\nLet\u2019s try this then: If we stopped after the first part, that \u201dlove\u201d could have been for the \u201dsport\u201d, right?

I appreciate the angle of this tune through the lens of alcoholism. Bruce writes about booze a lot and wonder how much of an alcoholic he is. Clearly his father was, and of course Bruce himself was arrested for an alcohol-related infraction. It&#8217;s none of my business, but as a recovering alcoholic myself I  care for anyone suffering from this disease. Thanks for the explanation of what &#8220;ride me down easy&#8221; means. Now that I understand the context from the Billy Joe Shaver song, it gives this tune even more vulnerability. As for the interpretation of the narrator being washed up, I&#8217;m not sure I agree. He has worked his life in an exciting profession, has had amazing life experiences (working with John Wayne), has great stories to tell, is still employed in Hollywood, and even gets recognized at the bar by beautiful young ladies, getting love from people who recognize his work. Sounds like an enviable life to me, and much less soul-crushing than having spent a life toiling in a factory. He is alone, and clearly a suffering alcoholic, but I sense that he is looking back on his life with pride and fulfillment at what he&#8217;s done. He lived his dreams. He may not have made it to the A list, but he has had, and continues to enjoy, a great career in his older years. I have been to many funerals of family members throughout my life at that exact cemetery \u2014 Forest Lawn. Once of my relatives is actually buried there right next to Bing Crosby! As a low-level actor in the film industry myself who is thrilled by my job, and can&#8217;t believe I get paid to live my dreams, but isn&#8217;t too famous, and who is also a bachelor to boot, riding this world alone, this song connects me on so many levels. At least I quit drinking five years ago and don&#8217;t suffer the shame and hurt of waking up with my clothes and boots on, hungover, which happened so many times. More widely, I can&#8217;t stop thinking about how the Western Stars album has become by favorite Bruce album, and how it connects with me more directly than any other album he has ever written. I mean, Born to Run spoke to the high school version of myself, and Darkness calls to me when I&#8217;m entering the vortex of depression, and many of his other songs bring me so much joy&#8230;. but as an album, Western Stars speaks to me as if Bruce wrote me a letter addressed to my name, having grown up in the West among so much of the imagery he writes about. I am just astounded that he created such an amazing late-career masterpiece. I am in love with it and so thankful for it. The sweeping orchestration is so beautiful. The album gives me companionship and brotherhood. This title track, as well as Moonlight Motel, Chasin&#8217; Wild Horses, the Stuntman, as well as There Goes My Miracle, are some of the greatest songs he has ever written, and I hadn&#8217;t said that about any new tunes of Bruce for decades (though Ghosts and I&#8217;ll See You In My Dreams have also become all-time classics for me as well). I am so thankful for the Western Stars album and it has enriched life journey&#8230; I love you, Mr. Springsteen. Thank you for truly touching my soul with this one.</p>\n"}, "link": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/11/04/two-faces-western-stars/#comment-1942", "status": "approved", "type": "comment", "author_avatar_urls": {"24": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0b81c10d5c11ff61e8e837966457f3bcaa9123c6ca2bf15489f551a0503d1918?s=24&d=mm&r=g", "48": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0b81c10d5c11ff61e8e837966457f3bcaa9123c6ca2bf15489f551a0503d1918?s=48&d=mm&r=g", "96": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0b81c10d5c11ff61e8e837966457f3bcaa9123c6ca2bf15489f551a0503d1918?s=96&d=mm&r=g"}, "meta": {"_wp_note_status": null}, "_links": {"self": [{"href": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/comments/1942", "targetHints": {"allow": ["GET"]}}], "collection": [{"href": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/comments"}], "up": [{"embeddable": true, "post_type": "post", "href": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/30616"}], "children": [{"embeddable": true, "href": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/comments?parent=1942"}]}}, {"id": 1941, "post": 30616, "parent": 0, "author": 0, "author_name": "Jill Bush", "author_url": "", "date": "2021-11-04T10:01:49", "date_gmt": "2021-11-04T17:01:49", "content": {"rendered": "<p>Not sure I believe a word but brilliantly argued!

It\u2019s a great song in many respects but I feel it tries to straddle too many different intentions, and without really ending up anywhere at all. There\u2019s a risk the song will seem shallow, or dim.</p>\n<p>I think you\u2019re right that the first version wants to portray someone left behind in that same neighborhood, clinging to a memory expected technically to be repeatable. The second version  appears to (me to) be more about realizing that things don\u2019t stay the same. From someone who\u2019s life moved on somewhat but now is overwhelmed by memories on a trial return. Kind of. The bravery seems to become a haunting ideal. That\u2019s also about them native birds. It\u2019s also peculiar the song has qualities to be quite a crowd rocker, but there\u2019s in the end nothing to celebrate, but a kind of diffuse and common defeat. </p>\n<p>That and the song\u2019s vicinity to BJ and some other songs on BITUSA in theme and feel and lyrics and the like perhaps explains why it was left off. At some points I sense the words could come from verses subtracted from other tunes. There\u2019s a certain nostalgic vein there too (BJ etc) that may prove to be too much on one plate.</p>\n<p>Concerning 9/11 I would assume anything done in the years immediately after would be tinged by that event on several levels, also subconsciously, grappling with sense and meaning and images. Right?</p>\n<p>Mr. Bruce is and was a peculiar man. But that\u2019s what poets are for. Being peculiar in our stead. What would we be? </p>\n<p>I think the song might gain something from being looked at again lyrically. But I\u2019m not the band leader. </p>\n<p>O America&#8230;  O Vineland</p>\n"}, "link": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/09/24/roll-of-the-dice-none-but-the-brave/#comment-1930", "status": "approved", "type": "comment", "author_avatar_urls": {"24": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/409f09be8fc620982ee95e2a0a693add2368af9f98c3a795b5dc40da31a41f74?s=24&d=mm&r=g", "48": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/409f09be8fc620982ee95e2a0a693add2368af9f98c3a795b5dc40da31a41f74?s=48&d=mm&r=g", "96": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/409f09be8fc620982ee95e2a0a693add2368af9f98c3a795b5dc40da31a41f74?s=96&d=mm&r=g"}, "meta": {"_wp_note_status": null}, "_links": {"self": [{"href": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/comments/1930", "targetHints": {"allow": ["GET"]}}], "collection": [{"href": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/comments"}], "up": [{"embeddable": true, "post_type": "post", "href": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/4617"}]}}, {"id": 1924, "post": 24156, "parent": 0, "author": 0, "author_name": "PYan", "author_url": "", "date": "2021-10-29T14:57:00", "date_gmt": "2021-10-29T21:57:00", "content": {"rendered": "<p>HI Ken&#8230;nice translation&#8230;my take of it is a little less Freudian; while I agree there is a lot of romance in the first two verses, the last two is quite a switch: The narrator feels wronged or cheated on as adults must iknow wrong from right and never lie&#8230;the result is like Elvis Costello&#8217;s My Aim is true, where the narrator is a jealous murderer, and the final cross of my heart is over the lover&#8217;s dead body or grave.</p>\n"}, "link": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/12/29/roll-of-the-dice-cross-my-heart/#comment-1924", "status": "approved", "type": "comment", "author_avatar_urls": {"24": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f54f3fd4fc2f18a0e987deb3699c6f19a141fe5a2fd90a78e6b98f58ee52c470?s=24&d=mm&r=g", "48": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f54f3fd4fc2f18a0e987deb3699c6f19a141fe5a2fd90a78e6b98f58ee52c470?s=48&d=mm&r=g", "96": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f54f3fd4fc2f18a0e987deb3699c6f19a141fe5a2fd90a78e6b98f58ee52c470?s=96&d=mm&r=g"}, "meta": {"_wp_note_status": null}, "_links": {"self": [{"href": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/comments/1924", "targetHints": {"allow": ["GET"]}}], "collection": [{"href": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/comments"}], "up": [{"embeddable": true, "post_type": "post", "href": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/24156"}]}}, {"id": 1922, "post": 9386, "parent": 1921, "author": 0, "author_name": "P P J", "author_url": "", "date": "2021-10-28T16:31:48", "date_gmt": "2021-10-28T23:31:48", "content": {"rendered": "<p>Distinctive, was the word I sought.

I became a die-hard Bruce fan in the early nineties, and no album that he has released in my fandom has hit me like Western Stars \u2014 it hasn\u2019t even been close\u2026 with the hindsight of two years of consideration, my feelings for this album have only grown. It\u2019s stunning that Bruce created such a masterpiece like this so late in his career\u2026 it\u2019s become one of the most meaningful albums of my entire life. Everything he says and does speaks directly to me. Chasin\u2019 Wild Horses is my favorite, along with Moonlight Motel. The aching themes of loneliness and trying to outrun your past resonate so strongly. Mix those with the picturesque Western lyrical imagery, and it sets off fireworks in my heart. But what really takes this song into the stratosphere are the orchestral instrumental sections. They create such a powerful, swelling concoction of love, beauty, loss, regret, and sadness, while triggering cinematic visuals in my imagination of my favorite epic, lush mountain ranges in Northern New Mexico where I used to live\u2026 in these emotional instrumentals, I can see the verdant valleys, the tree-covered peaks, the meandering streams\u2026. and the final 20 seconds of steel guitar evokes images of staring up at the night sky while camping alone in the mountains, staring up at millions of western stars&#8230; I was absolutely floored when I first heard this, and my love for this five minute experience only grows\u2026. Just one nitpick, though. The narrator doesn\u2019t work in Montana. If you lived or worked in Montana, you wouldn\u2019t say I work \u201con the Montana line.\u201d He clearly lives in an adjoining state, like Idaho or Wyoming, and works adjacent to the border with Montana. To explain: if you lived in New Jersey, and you worked along the border with Pennsylvania, you wouldn\u2019t tell someone \u201cI work on the New Jersey line,\u201d you would say you were working on the Pennsylvania line, and in \u201cHighway Patrolman,\u201d while the narrator is in the U.S., he says that the Canadian border is 5 miles from here, not that the American border is near. If I were in Texas, about to reach Oklahoma, you wouldn\u2019t say, \u201cI\u2019m about to hit the Texas border!\u201d  If one works or lives in a place, one doesn\u2019t identify a border by one\u2019s own jurisdiction, but by the place on the other side.

I&#8217;ve come across numerous different takes on these songs by reading your essays, so thanks for that. </p>\n<p>As you might suspect, I have a different take than you on this one. Sounds like you&#8217;ve encountered that more than a few times&#8230;</p>\n<p>Darkness has a position in my top 5, written in ink. Part of it is biological impression, I suppose &#8212; it was the first Springsteen record I was exposed to, and the connection came through my dad, so it shouldn&#8217;t take much to figure out the emotional weight there.</p>\n<p>But it is more than that. Where you find the final stanza less than defiant and not heroic, my read is that it is heroic <i>because</i> it is so defiant. Despite all that&#8217;s happened in the world, all that&#8217;s happened to him, and all his own failings, the narrator refuses to surrender. It is the same man who shouted more exuberantly about this same sentiment in &#8220;Badlands,&#8221; and now his cry is a bit more weary, even a little resigned, as if to say, &#8220;I might very well lose here, but I&#8217;m not giving up, and I&#8217;m going out with sincerity.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Anyway, not trying to argue here (see my first line), just proposing how the song speaks to me. Defiance in the face of adversity is something we&#8217;ve all experienced. &#8220;Darkness on the Edge of Town&#8221; captures that for me.  The heroism isn&#8217;t grand, it is a gritty, everyday brand of tenacity&#8230; but sometimes even that is hard to possess. This song celebrates that.</p>\n"}, "link": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/04/10/roll-of-the-dice-darkness-on-the-edge-of-town/#comment-1902", "status": "approved", "type": "comment", "author_avatar_urls": {"24": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/700f84ada9c91a30aee24b1a61615b49fedde40fa5bd643e0d22e65a7ad21889?s=24&d=mm&r=g", "48": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/700f84ada9c91a30aee24b1a61615b49fedde40fa5bd643e0d22e65a7ad21889?s=48&d=mm&r=g", "96": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/700f84ada9c91a30aee24b1a61615b49fedde40fa5bd643e0d22e65a7ad21889?s=96&d=mm&r=g"}, "meta": {"_wp_note_status": null}, "_links": {"self": [{"href": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/comments/1902", "targetHints": {"allow": ["GET"]}}], "collection": [{"href": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/comments"}], "up": [{"embeddable": true, "post_type": "post", "href": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/1469"}], "children": [{"embeddable": true, "href": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/comments?parent=1902"}]}}, {"id": 1897, "post": 30275, "parent": 1896, "author": 1, "author_name": "Ken", "author_url": "", "date": "2021-10-22T14:51:53", "date_gmt": "2021-10-22T21:51:53", "content": {"rendered": "<p>Me too.</p>\n"}, "link": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/10/15/roll-of-the-dice-down-to-the-riverside/#comment-1897", "status": "approved", "type": "comment", "author_avatar_urls": {"24": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d037d3a05b6c9e4ee09ccdf24f113649cbc6f244d3e0a5706ee0a42186f079dc?s=24&d=mm&r=g", "48": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d037d3a05b6c9e4ee09ccdf24f113649cbc6f244d3e0a5706ee0a42186f079dc?s=48&d=mm&r=g", "96": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d037d3a05b6c9e4ee09ccdf24f113649cbc6f244d3e0a5706ee0a42186f079dc?s=96&d=mm&r=g"}, "meta": {"_wp_note_status": null}, "_links": {"self": [{"href": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/comments/1897", "targetHints": {"allow": ["GET"]}}], "collection": [{"href": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/comments"}], "author": [{"embeddable": true, "href": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/users/1"}], "up": [{"embeddable": true, "post_type": "post", "href": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/30275"}], "in-reply-to": [{"embeddable": true, "href": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/comments/1896"}]}}, {"id": 1896, "post": 30275, "parent": 0, "author": 0, "author_name": "Suzanne Valle", "author_url": "", "date": "2021-10-22T14:43:00", "date_gmt": "2021-10-22T21:43:00", "content": {"rendered": "<p>This song is amazing!
