Now, it\u2019s right there with Irving Berlin\u2019s God Bless America. Which I also actually like in its geographical descriptions which I prefer to \u201crockets red glare.\u201d But, this is definitely a patriotic song for me now and NOT an inclusive one. </p>\n<p>We both love Bruce and I think perhaps a less \u201csyrupy\u201d cover of he and Obama\u2019s January 2009 experience could reflect the continuing complicated relationships in our country that purposely leave out \u201cverses\u201d of our fellow citizens\u2019 experiences. </p>\n<p>I say 2009 because even Obama wasn\u2019t going to save this country from itself which I sadly had to learn under the last twice-impeached president. A sad lesson that continues every day for me. </p>\n<p>We all have a journey of citizenship and I absolutely loved singing this song in elementary school.

This is the only thing I find alienating about him. I have heard him in interviews and of course in several songs convey his poorly informed and cynical views on many things. And few of his songs express gratitude for what he has been able to achieve by living in this country, about which he finds little good to say (just like his buddy Barack Obama). Springsteen&#8217;s enormous talent and hard work alone would not necessarily have gotten him where he is in most other countries. And I imagine that many of the average Joes and Janes out there working those dreary jobs which Bruce has never had a day in his life and about whom he has written endlessly over the decades would also resent him for these attitudes as well.</p>\n<p>Not politically related, but I have also wondered and been disappointed by never having heard a single song in which he writes about being a father. Given the hugely haunting presence of his own father in his life and some of the incredible songs he has written about that relationship (Independence Day for example) it&#8217;s very revealing that he has not written about the experience from the other side.

I was just revisiting this recording and noticed a comment on my video pointing to this blog. I&#8217;m very tickled to see it noticed and I&#8217;m touched by the compliments. I am not a habitual maker of music; usually just a passionate listener. The recordings in my videos were made when I was with an ex-partner who is a professional musician. We had a studio at the house and he&#8217;s a very talented instrumentalist. I can&#8217;t play anything, so since we split I haven&#8217;t had access to the goods to make any more recordings. But for me it was never for more than my own satisfaction. I don&#8217;t enjoy performing for an audience and never wanted wide attention. I&#8217;m a social worker/mental health therapist by trade, and that&#8217;s where my passion lies for my life&#8217;s work.

But inevitably all things do come to an end.

The toast to the Moonlight Motel is one from a grateful person for the gifts he was granted.
