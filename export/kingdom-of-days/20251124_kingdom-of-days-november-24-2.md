**1974:** Bruce takes the bus from Asbury Park down to Philadelphia to spend a couple of days with local DJ Ed Sciaky, starting with a visit to a local studio the next morning to meet David Bowie.
**1975:** Bruce makes a return visit to the Hammersmith Odeon in London a week after his debut performance. Bruce tour premieres “[Wear My Ring Around Your Neck](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/07/07/cover-me-wear-my-ring-around-your-neck/)” for the occasion, and he closes the show with the last “[Little Queenie](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/12/11/cover-me-little-queenie/)” for almost a quarter-century. This show is available as part of Bruce’s official archive series–get it [here](https://live.brucespringsteen.net/live-music/0,25780/Bruce-Springsteen---The-E-Street-Band-mp3-flac-download-11-24-1975-Hammersmith-Odeon-London-UK.html).

**1980:** Night Two at the Capital Center in Largo on the River Tour is filmed (not by Springsteen’s crew, but by sneaky employees at the venue).

**1996:** Bruce kicks off Year Two(!) of the Ghost of Tom Joad Tour with a trio of shows at the Paramount Theater in Asbury Park. Each show is special–a homecoming of sorts, with guest stars and tour premieres galore. On this, Night One, Bruce is joined at various times throughout the night by Patti, Soozie, and Danny. Bruce tour premieres “[Independence Day](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/03/14/roll-of-the-dice-independence-day/),” “[Wild Billy’s Circus Story](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/03/14/roll-of-the-dice-wild-billys-circus-story/),” “[When You’re Alone](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/11/15/roll-of-the-dice-when-youre-alone/),” “[4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/04/26/roll-of-the-dice-4th-of-july-asbury-park-sandy/),” and (remarkably) a wild, acoustic, “Rosalita (Come Out Tonight).” Kicking off with three tracks from *Greetings* and wrapping up with a pair from *Wild & Innocent* (before the customary “[The Promised Land](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/07/04/roll-of-the-dice-the-promised-land/)” finale), this certainly doesn’t feel like the Ghost of Tom Joad Tour.
