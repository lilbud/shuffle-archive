**1969:** Bruce plays his first ever show in California, at the Esalen Institute in Big Sur. He unexpectedly encounters a Freehold friend, Richard Blackwell, who sits in with the band during their New Years Eve gig.
**1975:** Bruce and the E Street Band wrap up 1975 with a magnificent show at Philadelphia’s Tower Theater. Fans in attendance don’t realize it, but they’re witnessing the last “[Does This Bus Stop at 82nd Street?](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/03/30/roll-of-the-dice-does-this-bus-stop-at-82nd-street/)” for 18 years, the last “[Mountain of Love](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/09/21/cover-me-mountain-of-love/)” for 33 years, and the last slow arrangement of “[Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/11/19/roll-of-the-dice-tenth-avenue-freeze-out/)” for 15 years. This show is available as part of Bruce’s official archive series–get it [here](http://live.brucespringsteen.net/live-music/0,12046/Bruce-Springsteen---The-E-Street-Band-mp3-flac-download-12-31-1975-Tower-Theater-Upper-Darby-PA.html).

**1977:** Bruce and the E Street Band join Southside Johnny and The Asbury Jukes on stage at the Capitol Theater in Passaic to close out 1977 in style. Bruce and the boys stick around to play a few songs of their own, including a “[Backstreets](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/05/14/roll-of-the-dice-backstreets/)” performance that leads off with the very first prototype of “[Drive All Night](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/02/27/roll-of-the-dice-drive-all-night/)” in a one-time-only arrangement.

**1978:** Bruce and the E Street Band play their last show of the year in Richfield, Ohio. It’s also the second-to-last show of the Darkness Tour, featuring the last “[Pretty Flamingo](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/12/04/cover-me-pretty-flamingo/)” for 25 years. Shortly after midnight, boisterous fans start lighting off firecrackers, one of which hits Bruce. Steve in particular does not take kindly to this. (Bruce is only a little more restrained.)

**1980:** Bruce and the boys close out the year with one of their most legendary, most documented and most bootlegged shows, at the Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale. Stretching out over four hours (including the intermission), the set list features 38 songs, including the live premiere of “[Held Up Without a Gun](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/10/12/roll-of-the-dice-held-up-without-a-gun/)” (played because it’s short and the band has a little time to kill before midnight) and the last “[Rendezvous](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/05/08/roll-of-the-dice-rendezvous/)” for 19 years. This show will be officially released decades later as part of Bruce’s official archive series–get it [here](http://live.brucespringsteen.net/live-music/0,12284/Bruce-Springsteen---The-E-Street-Band-mp3-flac-download-12-31-1980-Nassau-Veterans-Memorial-Coliseum-Uniondale-NY.html).
