***New for 2025:** New entry for 1972, 1977, 1979, 1994, and 2024*
**1968:** The Castiles headline a gig at the Hullabaloo in Freehold.

**1972:** Bruce is at 914 Sound Studios in Blauvelt for a mixing session for his upcoming debut album.
**1974:** Bruce and the E Street Band headline two shows at The Bottom Line in New York City. There’s an early performance (likely the earliest) of a *very* work-in-progress “Jungleland” that is believed to be from this show. It’s well worth a listen, as it’s dramatically different from the final version that will be released on vinyl over a year later.

**1977:** Bruce and the E Street Band work on “[Frankie](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/03/31/roll-of-the-dice-frankie/)” during a recording session at Atlantic Studios in New York City.
**1978:** Bruce and the boys bring the Darkness Tour to Dallas, where poor ticket sales force the show to be moved from the 10,000-seat Convention Center Arena to the 1,700-seat Convention Center Theater instead. Because fans have to exchange their tickets on the way in, it takes a long time to admit everyone, and you can hear Bruce ask fans for their patience before the show starts below.

**1979:** Bruce and the E Street Band work on “[I Wanna Marry You](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/04/22/roll-of-the-dice-i-wanna-marry-you/)” during a recording session at the Power Station in New York City.
**1984:** The Born in the U.S.A. Tour continues its midwest trek, arriving in East Troy, Wisconsin for the first of two nights. This show is notable for the world debut of the very rare “[Man at the Top](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/05/10/roll-of-the-dice-man-at-the-top/)” (played only twice since). According to press reports, director Brian De Palma shoots additional footage for “[Dancing in the Dark](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/12/25/roll-of-the-dice-dancing-in-the-dark/)” at this show. It’s unclear if any of it will be used.
