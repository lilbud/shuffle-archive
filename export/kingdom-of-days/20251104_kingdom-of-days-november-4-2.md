***New for 2025:** Audio for 1976 and 1977; review for 2002 and 2007; new entry for 2024*
**1971:** Tinker West drives Bruce to New York City to introduce him to future manager Mike Appel. Bruce performs a few songs for Appel on piano and acoustic guitar, including “[Song for Orphans](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/04/10/roll-of-the-dice-song-for-orphans/),” which Bruce will officially release 49 years later, and “[Baby Doll](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/10/13/roll-of-the-dice-baby-doll/),” which fails to impress. Bruce and Appel agree to touch base again someday, but their next meeting won’t happen for another four months.
**1975:** Bruce and the E Street Band play their second of three nights at Arizona State University in Tempe.
**1976:** Bruce and the band wrap up a six-night stand at the Palladium in New York City with a barnburner–especially the encores, in which Ronnie Spector joins the band for three of her greatest hits: “[Baby, I Love You](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/09/02/meeting-across-the-river-bruce-springsteen-and-ronnie-spector-baby-i-love-you/),” “[Walking in the Rain](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/01/13/matr-ronnie-spector-and-the-e-street-band-walking-in-the-rain/),” and “[Be My Baby](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/06/01/matr-bruce-springsteen-and-ronnie-spector-be-my-baby/).” All three are live debuts for Bruce and the E Street Band. Also debuting in the encores: Bruce’s cover of “[We Gotta Get Out of This Place](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/03/17/matr-bruce-springsteen-and-eric-burdon-we-gotta-get-out-of-this-place/).” The main set is pretty great, too, with a particularly inspired “[It’s My Life](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/11/23/cover-me-its-my-life/),” probably because one of its writers (Carl D’Errico) is in the audience.

**1977:** Bruce takes a break from the recording sessions for [*Darkness on the Edge of Town*](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/07/05/album-companion-darkness-on-the-edge-of-town/) at the Record Plant in New York City to call into radio station WIOQ-FM in Philadelphia, giving DJ Ed Sciaky one of his several interviews with Bruce over the years. Bruce is a bit overly optimistic about the album’s release date, though.
