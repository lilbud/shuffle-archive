**1980:** The night after Ronald Reagan is elected president of the United States, Bruce plays a pointedly intense show at Arizona State University in Tempe. This show will be officially released as part of Bruce’s official archive series (get it [here](http://live.brucespringsteen.net/live-music/0,13637/Bruce-Springsteen---The-E-Street-Band-mp3-flac-download-11-5-1980-ASU-Activity-Center-Tempe-AZ.html)), and as press reports note, the show is professionally filmed for release as a “videodisc” in 1981. It will take Bruce a bit longer than that, but the film will finally see the light of day in *The Ties That Bind: The River Collection* 35 years later. Barry Rebo shot the original footage, and he shares his recollections about the experience in [today’s installment of *Where the Band Was*](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/11/05/where-the-band-was-tempe-november-5-1980-barry-rebos-story/).

**1998:** At his surprise jam with Clarence the night before, Bruce finds himself captivated by Clarence’s fiddle player, Randi Fishenfeld and makes plans to see her play with the Pamela Stanley Band the following night. The show is rained out however, but a quick-thinking booking agent arranges for the band to play at an indoor venue instead, a nearby bar called Mulvaney’s. Bruce and Clarence join the crowd that night and Fishenfeld puts on a great show for them.
