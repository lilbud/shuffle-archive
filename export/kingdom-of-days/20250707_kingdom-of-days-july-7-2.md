**1977:** Bruce and the E Street Band work on “The Promise” and “[Don’t Look Back](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/05/03/roll-of-the-dice-dont-look-back/)” during recording sessions at Atlantic Studios in New York City.
**1978:** Bruce and the band play one of their most legendary shows when the Darkness Tour takes over the Roxy Theater in West Hollywood. The show is a surprise, announced only the day prior, and tickets are hard to come by, as the venue only holds 500 people. Bruce opens with his debut of “[Rave On](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/03/25/matr-bruce-springsteen-and-gary-busey-rave-on/)” and later covers “[Heartbreak Hotel](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/04/11/matr-bruce-springsteen-and-robert-gordon-heartbreak-hotel/)” for the first time as well. More significantly, this show also sees the premiere of an early version of “[Point Blank](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/12/19/roll-of-the-dice-point-blank/)” in a very different form, along with the debut of “[Independence Day](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/03/14/roll-of-the-dice-independence-day/).” The show is broadcast live on KMET-FM, and Bruce’s performance of “[For You](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/01/08/roll-of-the-dice-for-you/)” will eventually serve as the B-side for his single for a live performance of “[Fire](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/08/05/roll-of-the-dice-fire/),” released in 1987. Several songs from this show will appear years later on *Live 1975-85*. This show is available as part of Bruce’s official archive series–get it [here](http://live.brucespringsteen.net/live-music/0,19731/Bruce-Springsteen---The-E-Street-Band-mp3-flac-download-7-7-1978-The-Roxy-West-Hollywood-CA.html).
