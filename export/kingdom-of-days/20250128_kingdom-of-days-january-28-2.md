Meanwhile in Freehold, New Jersey, controversy reigns at a town council meeting after a local college student requests that South Street be renamed as Bruce Springsteen Boulevard. The story will garner national attention over the coming weeks.

**1998:** At the Paramount Theater in Asbury Park, Bruce rehearses for an upcoming benefit concert for slain police office Patrick King.
**2009:** Rehearsals continue at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa for Bruce’s upcoming halftime show at the Super Bowl.
**2014:** Night Two in Cape Town features fourteen tour premieres, including “[Just Like Fire Would](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/05/24/cover-me-just-like-fire-would/).” Bruce performs “[We Shall Overcome](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/08/15/roll-of-the-dice-cover-me-we-shall-overcome/)” and “[This Little Light of Mine](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/06/29/cover-me-this-little-light-of-mine/)” in memory of Pete Seeger, who died the day before. With a Seeger Tour arrangement of “[Open All Night](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/10/28/roll-of-the-dice-open-all-night/)” thrown in, the show almost feels like a throwback to 2006.
