**1974:** Bruce and the E Street Band play at Avery Fisher Hall in New York City, and the show is of note for several reasons: first, because it features the debut of Suki Lahav, who will join the tour as a regular player a few shows later. Second, because it features the debut (or at least the earliest known performance) of “[She’s the One](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/04/04/roll-of-the-dice-shes-the-one/),” which actually features lyrics from what will become “[Backstreets](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/05/14/roll-of-the-dice-backstreets/).” Third, the encore is abruptly halted due to the collapse of the front rows of seats–just before Bruce is slated to play what would have been his only performance of “On Broadway.”

**1975:** Bruce cancels a sold-out show at the University of Maryland when he learns that the venue holds 10,000 people. (At this point in his career, Bruce is violently opposed to playing large venues.) Instead, the Born to Run Tour moves on to Michigan Palace in Detroit, and the *Born to Run* hype and emerging backlash is starting to get to Bruce. Bruce will recall this as a night on which he didn’t want to perform, but with his band around him and a set list constructed to keep the energy level high, he nevertheless delivers a great show that features his live debut of “[Ain’t Too Proud to Beg.](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/10/06/cover-me-aint-too-proud-to-beg/)”

**1979:** Bruce approves and submits his fifth studio album, *The Ties That Bind*. The album will be shelved before release, however, with Bruce opting instead to release a double-album called *The River.* Thirty-six years later, *The Ties That Bind* will finally see the light of day in the box set *The Ties That Bind: The River Collection*.

**2003:** The Rising Show reaches its end with a third and final show at Shea Stadium, and what a star-studded show it is: Opening with “[Code of Silence](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/08/27/codeofsilence/)” and closing with “[Blood Brothers](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/12/06/roll-of-the-dice-blood-brothers/)” (played for the first time this tour) provides a sentimental callback to the end of the Reunion Tour. In between, Bruce and the band tour premiere “[I Wish I Were Blind](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/10/17/roll-of-the-dice-i-wish-i-were-blind/)” (in its first E Street Band performance), “[Back in Your Arms](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/11/10/roll-of-the-dice-back-in-your-arms/),” “[Light of Day](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/12/06/roll-of-the-dice-light-of-day/),” “[Highway 61 Revisited](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/11/07/meeting-across-the-river-bruce-springsteen-bob-dylan-and-friends-highway-61-revisited/)” (with Bob Dylan!), and “[Quarter to Three](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/08/21/cover-me-quarter-to-three/)” (with Gary U.S. Bonds, Laurie Anderson, Garland Jeffreys, and Willie Nile). An amazing end to a revitalizing tour.
