***New for 2025:** Audio for 1975*
**1969:** Child reluctantly plays a gig at The Student Prince in Asbury Park. Why reluctantly? Because Woodstock was happening at the same time, and that’s where the band wants to be–but they honor their commitment.
**1975:** Bruce and the E Street Band wrap up their legendary five-night stand at The Bottom Line in New York City with two final shows. The buzz from these shows will turbocharge Bruce’s career and the remainder of the Born to Run Tour.

**2018:** *Springsteen on Broadway* continues its theatrical run at the Walter Kerr Theater in New York City.
**2021:** *Springsteen on Broadway* resumes its limited return engagement at the St. James Theater in New York City after a month-long break. During the hiatus, the pandemic has resurged and masks are a requirement among the audience again. Bruce also winks at the recent “Thunder Road” debate, definitively and repetitively singing “sways” to put the matter to rest.
