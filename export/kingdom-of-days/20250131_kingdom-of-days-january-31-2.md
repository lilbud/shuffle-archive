**1973:** Bruce and the band eventually known as E Street open a six-night, two-shows-nightly stand at Max’s Kansas City in New York City, opening for Biff Rose. Several tracks from this show are professionally recorded for use on The King Biscuit Flower Hour, but only “[Bishop Danced](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/05/18/roll-of-the-dice-bishop-danced/)” will be aired. That “Bishop Danced” recording, however, will see the light of day again 25 years later, when it is released on *Tracks*.

The late show was recorded, too–but only the first two songs have surfaced. But those songs are ultra–rare and heard by very few fans in concert: “Saga of the Architect Angel” and “[Song for Orphans](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/04/10/roll-of-the-dice-song-for-orphans/).” Listen to both below.
