**1975:** With the opening show of the Born to Run Tour only a day away, and final production tinkering running almost to the last minute (“Jungleland” is *still* unfinished), Bruce and the E Street Band rehearse the show for the first and only time at the Record Plant in New York City. The rehearsal runs a staggering *nineteen hours,* which probably explains their subdued appearance in the sunrise photo below. (Photo credit: Barbara Pyle)

**1988:** Bruce and the band play a historic show in East Berlin, their first in East Germany. The show is broadcast across East Germany, but as many as 300,000 fans still flocked to the concert grounds for the show, where Bruce greets them in German, “It’s nice to be in East Berlin. I want to tell you that I’m not here for or against any government. I have come to play rock and roll for the East Berliners in the hope that one day all barriers will be torn down.” It’s believed that this show galvanized East Germany’s youth and contributed to the accelerated reunification of the country. The show also featured the tour premieres of “[Out in the Street](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/10/28/roll-of-the-dice-out-in-the-street/)” and “[The Promised Land](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/07/04/roll-of-the-dice-the-promised-land/).” Read more [here](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jul/05/bruce-springsteen-east-germany-berlin-wall) and watch below.
