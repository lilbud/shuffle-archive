**1975:** Bruce works on “Thunder Road” at a recording session at the Record Plant in New York City.
**1978:** Before his Darkness show at the Sam Houston Coliseum, Bruce Stops by Houston radio station KILT-FM for a wide-ranging interview. Of particular interest are the interviewer’s probing questions on Bruce’s attitude towards women and Bruce’s discomfort with the questions.
(Note: Brucebase says that the interview is with Ed Beauchamp, but unless Ed developed a British accent for the occasion, I don’t believe that’s him doing the interviewing. If anyone knows who it is, please let me know.)

That evening, Bruce and the E Street Band perform “The Promise” during their show. It won’t be performed again for more than two decades.

**2003:** Bruce and the E Street Band kick off the final leg of the Rising Tour with the first of a ten-night stand at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford.
