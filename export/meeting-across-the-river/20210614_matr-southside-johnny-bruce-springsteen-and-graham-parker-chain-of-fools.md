Aretha Franklin’s “Chain of Fools” topped the R&B chart for four weeks, peaked at #2 on the Hot 100, won Franklin a Grammy Award (and later a Grammy Hall of Fame Award), and landed dead center on *Rolling Stone’s* 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.
Not bad for a song built around a single chord.

“Chain of Fools” endures in popularity not just because of Franklin’s outstanding performance, but also because of the appeal of its lyrics, which resonated with women in abusive relationships like the narrator’s, and with Vietnam soldiers and veterans (particularly African-Americans) who equated the titular chain with their chain of command.
It’s also just a great, bluesy rock and roll song, made for jamming–which is exactly what happened when Bruce and Graham Parker joined Southside Johnny on stage at the Stone Pony in 2001 to celebrate the 25th anniversary (a few days early) of Southside’s milestone live radio simulcast.
Southside, Bruce and Parker grooved on “Chain of Fools” for nine minutes (with a generous helping of John Fogerty’s “[Born on the Bayou](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/04/19/matr-john-fogerty-and-bruce-springsteen-born-on-the-bayou/)” in the middle), and while Bruce stays in a supporting role throughout the “Chain of Fools” part, we can clearly hear his prominent guitar solo and backing vocals.

To date, that remains Bruce’s only performance of one of Aretha’s all-time greatest hits.
