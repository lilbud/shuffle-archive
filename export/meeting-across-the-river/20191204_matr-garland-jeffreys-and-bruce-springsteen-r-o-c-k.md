We can hear the E Street connection in Garland Jeffreys’ “R.O.C.K.” from its very first notes–that’s Roy Bittan featured prominently on piano throughout.

Buried deep on Jeffreys’ 1981 album *Escape Artist* (produced by Bob Clearmountain and featuring Danny Federici’s keyboards as well as Roy’s piano), “R.O.C.K.” is an irresistible anthem that demands to be played at full volume.

Still, despite Bruce’s many stage appearances with Garland Jeffreys over the years (eighteen as of this writing), Bruce and Garland only once tackled what should have been a natural team-up.

Or to be more accurate, they played it three times, once nightly during Bruce’s three-night holiday show stand in December 2003, when Bruce invited Garland to “lift up” the show.

Here’s a wonderful clip from the second night, with Garland and Bruce backed by The Max Weinberg 7.

Bruce and Garland certainly lifted the show, and you can clearly sense their mutual esteem and affection.
