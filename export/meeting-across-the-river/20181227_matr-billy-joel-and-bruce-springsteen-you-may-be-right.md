“You May Be Right” is one of Billy Joel’s best-known songs.
The first track on and second single from his chart-topping 1980 *Glass Houses* album, “You May Be Right” peaked at #7 in the US and became a setlist staple in Billy’s still incredibly popular concerts.

Almost thirty years after its release, Bruce joined Billy on stage at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame anniversary concerts and supported him on “You May Be Right.” The performance isn’t included in the official CD or video releases, but fortunately some generous fans captured it live
Check out Bruce’s one and only performance of “You May Be Right” below–the video is shaky, but the audio is clear.
