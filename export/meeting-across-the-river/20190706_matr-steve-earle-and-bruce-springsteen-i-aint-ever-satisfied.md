“I Ain’t Ever Satisfied” may never have the hit it deserved to be (it only peaked at #26 on the U.S. Mainstream Rock chart), but Earle’s fans still rank it as one of their favorites, and it’s still one of Earle’s most frequently performed songs.

With its defiant theme and wordless “Woh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh ” chorus, “I Ain’t Ever Satisfied” sounds tailor-made for a Springsteen cover or duet.

We got the latter when Bruce joined Steve Earle on stage during the encore set at Earle’s 1998 show at Tradewinds in Sea Bright, New Jersey.
**First performed:**
Here’s that one-time only performance, from February 6, 1998. Bruce is on guitar the whole time, and you’ll hear his vocals kick in at around the halfway point.
