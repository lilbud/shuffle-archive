On April 2, 2011, Nicky Addeo and the Night Owls played the Wonder Bar in Asbury Park.

Nicky Addeo isn’t a household name, but in 1963 he released a song called “Gloria” with The Darchaes, and Bruce was a big fan of it.

“When you wanted to make your move, you waited for Nicky Addeo to sing [Gloria](https://youtu.be/7TSwtof6LTQ),” Bruce explained that evening in Asbury Park. Bruce got a chance to play the song with Nicky that night, and he stayed on stage for several songs, including “What’s Your Name?”
