On January 18, 1989, Bruce joined an all-star jam band at the fourth annual Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony. Included in the set: Larry Williams’ 1957 hit, “Bony Moronie.”

Bruce can only be seen and heard on guitar in the newly uploaded video below, but since it’s the only known recorded instance of him playing it, I’m sharing and including it here.
