“Sea of Heartbreak” first became a hit in 1961, when Don Gibson took it all the way to #2 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart.

It charted again eleven years later, when Kenny Price took it to #24.

If only Johnny Cash had released it as a single when he recorded it for his 1996 *Unchained* album, “Sea of Heartbreak” might have charted for *four* consecutive decades.
He didn’t though, and the streak ended. But that didn’t stop Cash’s daughter Rosanne from taking a run at it herself in 2009.
Well, not exactly by herself. From Cash’s album, *The List,* here’s “Sea of Heartbreak” with Bruce Springsteen.
