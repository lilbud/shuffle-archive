It’s shocking that it took Bruce until 1995 to cover what is arguably The Rolling Stones’ greatest song (*Rolling Stone* and *Ultimate Classic Rock* certainly think so, at least); it’s even more surprising that he hasn’t covered it since.

Or properly, for that matter, since his one and only stab at it (other than quoting it nightly in “[Cover Me](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/01/13/roll-of-the-dice-cover-me/)” on the Tunnel of Love Express Tour) was with Joe Grushecky on backing vocals and guitar only.

In the autumn of 1995, Bruce became an honorary (and temporary) Houserocker, joining the band for their “October Assault” in support of Joe’s Bruce-produced [*American Babylon*](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/10/17/american-babylon-a-retrospective/) album (which, IMHO, every Springsteen fan should own).

When the band played their final of three shows at Nick’s Fat City in Pittsburgh on the evening of October 21st, “Gimme Shelter” was a setlist bonus. Fortunately, the performance was captured for posterity and issued on the CD single for Joe’s “[Labor of Love](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/05/08/matr-joe-grushecky-and-bruce-springsteen-labor-of-love/).” While you can clearly here Bruce on backing vocals and guitar throughout, it’s a performance worth listening to even if Bruce hadn’t been there. The Houserockers more than do justice to the original.

**Gimme Shelter**9 original, not only did *Rolling Stone* cite it as the best output from the band, they ranked it near the very top–#36–in their 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list.

One last Bruce connection of note: the Stones’ version of “Gimme Shelter” wouldn’t have been the same without the vocal contributions of Merry Clayton, whose vocals build with such power that even Mick Jagger can be heard exclaiming “Woo!” in response late in the song.

And Merry Clayton happens to be one of the singers featured in the outstanding 2013 film, *20 Feet From Stardom*, which itself has several on-screen contributions from… Bruce Springsteen.
