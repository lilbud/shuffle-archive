“Down in the Valley” was a romantic country soul hit for Solomon Burke in 1962, even though it was originally released as a B-side (to “I’m Hanging My Heart Up for You”). “Valley” outperformed its A-side, peaking at #71 on the Billboard Pop chart.

Bruce covered “Down in the Valley” only once, at the Stone Pony with Southside Johnny and The Asbury Jukes, on October 13, 1977. The recording quality isn’t great, but it’s Bruce’s only known performance of the song. We’re fortunate to have a document of it.
If you pay close attention at the end, you’ll notice the boys get out of the song by lifting the ending of Bruce’s concert arrangement of “[Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/11/19/roll-of-the-dice-tenth-avenue-freeze-out/).”
