Let’s reach waaay back in Joe Grushecky’s catalog–all the way back to the Iron City Houserocker days and the band’s sophomore album (and one of the better albums of 1980), [*Have a Good Time But Get Out Alive*](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/05/22/have-a-good-time-but-get-out-alive/).
Buried in the middle of Side Two of that is one of the album’s strongest tracks, “Junior’s Bar,” just screaming to be played live.

On March 23, 2014, Grushecky obliged during his joint concert with Bruce, and as a result, we have the one and only Grushecky/Springsteen performance of “Junior’s Bar.” Bruce hangs back on guitar for most of this one, but towards the end he steps up to the mic to provide backing vocals.

IMO, those particular nights (two back-to-back shows) didn’t feature Bruce at his best. He’d just finished the High Hopes Tour, and the tour-closing stand seem to exact a pretty steep toll on him.
Even with a week off to recover and despite a spectacular set list, he seemed less animated on-stage than usual, so I’m holding out hope that Joe and Bruce will give “Junior’s Bar” another go someday–I’d love to be there when they both cut loose on it.
