It must be Michigan week here on the Shuffle, because this is our second spotlight on a Wolverine State artist in the last few days.
This time the spotlight is on Detroit singer/songwriter Stewart Francke. He may not be as well known as Bob Seger, but he can one-up Bob when it comes to studio collaborations with Bruce Springsteen.
Back in 2011, Francke released his *Heartless World* album, with a lead-off track featuring a very prominent duet vocal by Bruce. “Summer Soldier (Holler If Ya Hear Me)” is about a wounded and dying soldier in the middle east, a soldier given voice by Bruce.

As for how the collaboration came to pass, Francke took the “nothing ventured, nothing gained” approach and sent the song (which he had always envisioned with Bruce’s voice in the call-and-response chorus) to Bruce’s management. The song made its way to Bruce, who admired it and agreed to contribute his vocals.
The result is a beautiful and poignant collaboration from two outstanding singer/songwriters.
