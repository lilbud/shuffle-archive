In 1965, The Drifters had a hit with “Come on Over to My Place.” It only reached #60 on the charts in the US (it made it to #9 in the UK), but it was enough to make an impression on Bruce and Cats on a Smooth Surface–they played it together at The Stone Pony five times during the summer and fall of 1982.
