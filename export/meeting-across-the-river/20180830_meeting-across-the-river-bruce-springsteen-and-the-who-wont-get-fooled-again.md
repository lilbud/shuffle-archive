On May 28, 2015, the MusiCares Foundation honored Pete Townshend at their annual MAP Fund concert, and Townshend’s award was presented by Bruce.
Bruce has cited The Who as a major influence on several occasions, most notably in an entertaining and enlightening conversation with Steve Van Zandt on the Underground Garage in 2011:

After Bruce presented the award, he joined Pete and Roger Daltrey on-stage for “[My Generation,](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/03/27/matr-pete-townshend-roger-daltry-and-bruce-springsteen-my-generation/)” and at the end of the night, he came back out (along with Willie Nile and Billy Idol) for “Won’t Get Fooled Again.”

But that wasn’t the first time Bruce played that song with Pete and Roger–the first and only other time was in 1990, when The Who were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. If you watch the video below carefully, you’ll see Bruce on guitar and backing vocals behind Daltrey for much of the performance.
