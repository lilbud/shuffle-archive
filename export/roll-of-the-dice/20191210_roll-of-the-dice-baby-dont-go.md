In early 1979, Bruce had a vision for a song.

He didn’t have much in the way of lyrics yet, but he had a hook, a theme, and a basic melody. (And if you listen closely to this home demo recording, you’ll hear him note that the song calls for a “Bennie and the Jets-type rhythm.”

It might seem like nothing every came of “Baby Don’t Go,” but listen again–there’s something vaguely familiar about the *feel* of the song, and the few lines that aren’t bluffed seem like they share some DNA with one of Bruce’s contemporary songs as well.

Compare:

*Now maybe I’m not the kind of man who you want*
*Maybe I can’t deliver to you all the things you so desire*

with:
**Recorded:**
*Well now you say you’ve found another man who does things to you that I can’t*

Did “Baby Don’t Go” ultimately lead Bruce to “[Fade Away](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/04/28/roll-of-the-dice-fade-away/)?” I can’t say with conviction, but there are certainly some similarities, and Bruce’s first take of “Fade Away” came shortly after his last recorded attempt at “Baby Don’t Go” (this time with a more up-tempo accompaniment).

Early ancestor or not, “Baby Don’t Go” is at least a fascinating inside look at the songwriting process that would shortly lead Bruce to some of his best River-era songs.
