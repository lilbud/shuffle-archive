There’s some debate as to the actual name of this unreleased, never-performed Springsteen original composition.

In Bruce’s handwritten notes, he refers to it as “I Heard the Word,” and certainly that line is oft-repeated. It was eventually copyrighted in 1995 under the title “The Word.”

But in the actual studio recording from 1972, it’s referred to verbally as “The Song,” and so that’s what we’ll go with.

Regardless of what you call the song, “The Song” is rather typical of Bruce’s early songwriting: lyrically lush with colorful nicknames, religious imagery, and dense metaphor describing the unknowable, unattainable, unchainable object of his desire.

*Well you flash your tongue like diamonds*
*You tied me to your wildcat schemes*
*And you forced me to into a power dive*
*And left your mark on my jeans*
*And I heard the word on your soldiers*
*And I heard the word on Jesus too*
*I heard the word on the country*
*But I never heard the word on you*

*Your love was like a machine gun*
*I wore your bugle in my belt*
*And I was your kid glove lover*
*All the cards were yours, you always dealt*
*And I stood before your soapbox*
*Noiseless and shoeless playing my pantry boy’s games*
*You had your raised up, you had your hands raised up*
*You were raised up to the sky shouting, “Oh Sunday deity*
*Oh Big Daddy Longlegs, come down and bless your sister please”*
*You were shouting orders about the construction going on down the highway*
*Doing the Virginia reel, you were naming names, blaming blames*
*And you blamed me*

*You wore your heart like a challenge*
*Far and apart for anyone who came*
*Open and wide like the river*
*With rocks on both sides to keep the water tame*
*But I heard the word on your high tides*
*And I felt the pain when I tried to rip your floodgates wide*
*And pull your body on over to my side where we both could hide*
*But you heard about the freedom ride*
*And you heard about the highway crew*
*Who could cut the light a little bit faster than you*
**Never Released**just your shoes*

*And I heard the word on Jesus*
*And I heard the word on his marching troops*
*I heard the word on the country*
*But I never heard the word on you*

It’s not one of Bruce’s strongest songs, even when considered just among his early work. It’s not surprising it was left off of *[Greetings from Asbury Park](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2023/01/05/album-companion-greetings-from-asbury-park-n-j/).* But it’s still a fascinating peek at an artist still developing his voice and his style.
