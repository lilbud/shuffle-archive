We’re almost finished working our way through Bruce Springsteen’s “[1968 Notebook](https://estreetshuffle.com/?s=1968+notebook),” a remarkably early collection of material written (but not recorded) by a budding eighteen-year-old singer-songwriter destined for rock and roll stardom.
The notebook contains twenty unreleased songs. We know of its existence only because it was sold in a 2006 public auction with scans made available for potential bidders.

Our subject today is the faded entry at the very bottom of the table of contents above: an almost-finished song called “Sun Time,” complete with chord notation and direction.

Bruce’s lyrics are just a little bit fuzzy in the scan–enough to obfuscate several words throughout (particularly in the third verse). However, enough is legible for us to get a sense of “Sun Time” as a tender bordering on sappy love song that was no doubt intended for Bruce’s acoustic performances.
*Like a forest after the rain*
*As teardrops of sunlight pushes the ???*
*Open like the sea after the storm ???*
*And tranquility once again starts to reign*
*Like a story that was never told*
*Like a mountain stream with waters running so cold*
*Like a flower wet with the spring*
*Like the silly songs that I sing*
*The earth with all its beauty came to bare*
*??? ??? through the silk thin strands of your honeyed hair*
*and I feel ??? ??? knowing that your ???*
*The thought that you may go away*
*Clouds my tender years with ???*
*‘Cause I can’t see without your eyes*
*And I can’t touch without your hands*
*And I can’t live without your life*
*And I can’t love without your love*
There’s not a lot to analyze here, due both to the illegible lines and the relatively straightforward nature metaphor as stand-in for his love interest. Again, though, the kid was just eighteen and only beginning to experiment with writing about love. Bigger and better songs lay ahead.
