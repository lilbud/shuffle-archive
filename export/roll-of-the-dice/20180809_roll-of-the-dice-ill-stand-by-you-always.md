**Updated August 9, 2019:** An official version of “I’ll Stand By You” was just released on the soundtrack album for *Blinded by the Light*. It’s a tighter, shorter, and much better mix, with new (or at least different) vocals than the leaked demo. From a musical standpoint, it’s a lot more listenable. Unfortunately, though, the lyrics are still the same.

Okay, admit it: when you heard that Bruce wrote an unsolicited song for a Harry Potter movie, this is probably pretty close to how you imagined it:

You have to give Conan points for nailing that E Street sound–I laughed out loud when the glockenspiel kicked in, and the sax solo was a nice touch, too. I know it’s just a parody, but I kinda dig it.
As for the *actual* song Bruce wrote for Harry Potter… um, I think I’ll just let Bruce do the talking on this one:

Yep, it’s true: Bruce really did write a Harry Potter song.
And yes: it’s uncharacteristic of something Bruce would ordinarily sing.
But is it good? Bruce sure seems to think so. And Chris Columbus, the director for *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone,* calls it “[one of the best songs he’d ever written](http://www.backstreets.com/columbus.html).” Me? Well, I must not be in the target demographic.
But because I’m an obsessive completist, let’s break it down:

Musically, “I’ll Stand By You” has a soft, easy-listening vibe–kind of like “[Let’s Be Friends (Skin to Skin)](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/03/02/roll-of-the-dice-lets-be-friends-skin-to-skin/)” but without the soul groove. To my ears, it’s flat and lifeless–almost the audio equivalent of stock photography.
Lyrically, well…
*You wake me in the night and your tears falling down, come let me dry them for you*
*I wish I could tell a story, chase away all those ghosts you’ve got inside of you*
*A story of heroes that fight on at any cost of a kingdom of love to be won or lost*
*We’ll fight here together ’til victory is won, come take my hand ’til the morning comes*
*Just close your eyes…*
Yeah, I get the allusions to a make-believe world, but the references to ghosts sound a bit forced, and the references to heroes fighting at any cost and a “‘kingdom of love” make me wonder if Bruce had actually even read the books.
*I’ll stand by you always, always, always*
*I’ll stand by you always, always, always*
The chorus is lovely enough, though. It’s just too bad about those verses…
*I know here in the dark, tomorrow can seem so very far away*
*Here the ghosts and the goblins can rise from your dreams to steal your heart away*
*Together we’ll chase those thieves that won’t leave you alone out from under the bed, out from over our home*
*And when the light comes we’ll laugh my love about the things that the night had us so frightened of*
*And until then…*
*I’ll stand by you always, always, always*
*I’ll stand by you always, always, always*
*Now I know it can feel like you’re slipping away, at night you’ll get lost in that deep dark place*
*We’ll let the night come and do what it may, together we’ll find the courage, we’ll find faith*
*Until you awake…*
Also: that bridge. Ouch. So of course he repeats it.
I hate being negative, and I really do have to give props to Bruce for writing an unsolicited Harry Potter song to delight his son. Seriously, that’s a superhero dad move right there.
But this isn’t Bruce anywhere near his best, and for me, this song is waaaaaay down at the bottom of my ranking list (Sorry, Chris). So to all my friends who swear I’ve never met a Bruce song I didn’t like: here you go.
To date, Bruce has never performed “I’ll Stand By You” in concert.
Please, for the love of Clarence: nobody bring a sign.
