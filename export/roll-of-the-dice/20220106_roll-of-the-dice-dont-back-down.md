For every song that made it onto *Born in the U.S.A.,* Bruce wrote five more that didn’t. We’ve listened to many of them here over the past four years, and we’ll listen to more before we bring this journey to a close.
“Don’t Back Down” is one of those coulda-been-a-contender songs, if only Bruce had finished it. Or maybe he did… studio records indicate he recorded a full-band version in June 1983 that remains unheard to this day.
The challenge is that we don’t know which “Don’t Back Down” he recorded.
Bruce actually had two different works-in progress by that name during the *Born in the U.S.A.* sessions, and an astonishing dozen different takes circulate on bootleg recordings. But here’s the interesting thing: eleven of those twelve songs use a common set of lyrics, but one of the twelve is completely unique in both words and music.
We’ll listen to the other eleven later this year. Today, we’re interested in the odd man out.
This version of “Don’t Back Down” is truly a separate song from the others, but it held just as much promise. Take a listen to the home demo below–it’s just Bruce accompanied by a drum machine, but the arrangement is complete enough for us to get a sense of what an E Street Band track might have sounded like.

Lyrically, this version of “Don’t Back Down” is still a work in progress–the third verse is just the first verse repeated and there are a few lines that sound at least lightly bluffed–but this is definitely a fully formed pop song with verses in the mold of “[Two Hearts](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/05/28/roll-of-the-dice-two-hearts/)” and a refrain reminiscent of “[No Surrender](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/11/18/roll-of-the-dice-no-surrender/).”
*If you’re out on your own and you ain’t got a home*
*And it feels like the whole world’s just gonna fall on you*
*You’re just running scared, look around, there’s nothing there*
*And you ain’t got the strength and your friends all just stall on you*
*Well, along comes a cloud, and you’re lost in the crowd*
*Once you thought you might make it, but babe, these days you doubt it*
*If you need a hand, honey, I understand*
*Just stand on up, yeah, stand up and shout it girl*
*Don’t back down, don’t back down*
*Don’t back down, don’t back down*
*Don’t back down, don’t back down*
*Don’t back down, don’t back down*
*Now you see all the ones worn out and tired*
*There’s a fool all broken down by the wayside*
*Where two hearts call out for hire*
*Filled with hurt, defeated by their foolish pride*
*Girl, you hear the sound of one comin’ down*
*And you don’t think that these days you can make it, babe*
*Just step on up, I’ll give a hand*
*And if you ain’t got a problem, maybe we can shed it, baby*
*Don’t back down, don’t back down*
*Don’t back down, don’t back down*
*Don’t back down, don’t back down*
*Don’t back down, don’t back down*
These aren’t Bruce’s deepest lyrics, but with a hook like that and a beat that doesn’t let up for even a moment’s breath, “Don’t Back Down” didn’t need depth to be a hit.
Is there a killer pop song in the vault called “Don’t Back Down,” just waiting for Bruce to get around to issuing that *Born in the U.S.A.* anniversary box set? Only time will tell. But even if we do get an official release someday, the question remains: which “Don’t Back Down” will it be?
