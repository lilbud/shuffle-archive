It showed up for the first time in a Bruce Springsteen Band set list, but one listen to “Do It With a Feeling” is all it takes to convince that Bruce wrote it for Steel Mill.

The Bruce Springsteen Band debuted “Do It With a Feeling” only twelve days into the band’s young life (as far as we know at least–set list details are sketchy from that era). As prolific as Bruce was at the time, though, this is clearly a Steel Mill song. (For a long time, the audio above was even believed to be a Steel Mill performance.)
It’s heavy, bordering on plodding (poor David Sancious is given little room to stretch) with spare lyrics that serve mostly to frame extended instrumental jams.
*I wanna tell you something*
*Yeah now I’m talkin’ tonight on the Bible*
*I’m sure you all know just what it says*
*Well how ya can’t do this, and ya can’t do that*
*There’s no messin’ round, or playin’ about on Sunday*
*Yeah now I got as much religion*
*As any man’s got, ain’t no doubt*
*But there’s a few commandments I’ve made up myself*
*That the Lord don’t know nothin’ about*
*That’s if you’re gonna do it*
*I said do it with a feeling*
*Do it till you hit the ceiling*
*Do it with a feeling*
*But if you’re gonna do it*
*Ah, do it with a feeling*
*Now once I thought I had a good woman*
*But Mama much to my surprise*
*She was playin’ around with each and every boy in town*
*Lord but she could get around some*
*Ah tell me can I get a witness*
*Cause I loved her just as much as I can*
*Well ??? that I’m her only man*
*???*
*Do it with a feeling*
*Do it till you’re rockin’ and reeling*
*Do it with a feeling*
*But if you’re gonna do it*
*Do it with a feeling*
*Ah won’t you come with me Mama*
*I’m going, won’t you get on board*
*My train it leaves in an hour*
*You gotta pay your witness to the Lord*
If it sounds like I’m throwing shade at the Steel Mill sound, I’m not–songs like this were made for bands like that. “Do It With a Feeling” is just ill-suited to the light-on-its feet Bruce Springsteen Band.
Still, it strikes a theme so Springsteenian that it’s practically his mission statement: *never phone it in*. And if you squint at that bridge, it sounds an awful like our narrator is idling his engine in front of Mary’s house, ready to pull out of there to win.
Even for a Bruce Springsteen Band fan like myself, “Do It With a Feeling” is forgettable, but it demonstrates that Bruce’s early band eras weren’t as distinct as we might otherwise think.
