Play this one *loud!*
You still won’t be able to make out much of the lyrics, but who cares? When you’ve got a song called “BoDo Rocker” (short for “Bo Diddley Rocker”), you already know it’s not about the words anyway.
It’s about the beat.

Bootleggers called it “I’m Goin’ Back” since it’s the obvious chorus, but “BoDo Rocker” (as it’s called in the studio session logs) is a more apt title. This five-and-a-half-minute rave-up is even more of an homage to Bo Diddley than Bruce’s previous two tributes, “[Preacher’s Daughter](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/07/01/roll-of-the-dice-preachers-daughter/)” and “[She’s the One](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/04/04/roll-of-the-dice-shes-the-one/).”
Bruce starts us off with a wailing harmonica intro, but from the moment the band enters at the five-second mark, “BoDo Rocker” is a freight train that cannot be stopped.
I’ve seen several attempts to transcribe the lyrics; I’m convinced all of them are way off. But since the vocals are buried so far in the mix, I’m not going to be of much help either. Like I said, though: the lyrics aren’t the point, because if you’re paying attention to the lyrics you’re missing out on the E Street Band at their Darkness-era peak.
Bruce calls on every member of the band to keep that train barreling down the tracks. The Professor is all over his keys, Max is a veritable machine, The Big Man is on another plane, and Bruce–when he isn’t turning in one of his finest studio harmonica performances–sings like a man possessed. (I love his evil laugh when the song comes to a crashing halt.)
Recorded in late 1977, “BoDo Rocker” never had a prayer of making it onto [*Darkness on the Edge of Town*](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/07/05/album-companion-darkness-on-the-edge-of-town/). It would have steamrolled over all the carefully crafted tracks on that classic album.
But I’d consider paying platinum prices to see them play it live on the next tour.
