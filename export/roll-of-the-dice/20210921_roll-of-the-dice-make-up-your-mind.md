Autumn starts tomorrow, but today it’s still summer. And if it’s still summer, it’s a good day for The Bruce Springsteen Band.

Even though this recording is from a February 1972 gig, something about the Bruce Springsteen Band sound has always screamed *summer* to me, and this little gem is a great example.

“Make Up Your Mind” is an end-of-summer breakup song with a twist. Bruce’s narrator is the older, worldly suitor; the offscreen love interest is the younger-than-she-looks but older-than-her-years schoolgirl who calls the shots in their zero-sum relationship until she tires of him and moves on.

In the first verse, our narrator appears to hold the upper hand: he wants the girl, he gets the girl, and when the girl falls for him (or so he thinks) and demands a commitment, we feel his lone wolf spirit start to slip away.

*Hey now baby, when I walk with you*
*Aw you make me feel just fine*
*Yeah and Darlin’ when I talk to you*
*Oh Child, I could not read between your lines*
*Oh how was I to know you were just a lonely teenager*
*It didn’t show, nah, it didn’t show*
*And like a man on the hunt*
*I was trying to cage her*
*But she wouldn’t go, she couldn’t go*
*And after she told me how she loved me so*
*Said you’d better make up your mind, babe*
*You’d better do it in time, babe*
*It’s me or you, you got to choose*
*Somebody’s got to lose*

That last line raises a flag: she seems less interested in monogamy than in victory. Sure enough, once she has her man captive, she loses interest. Her professions of love were only a tactic in a game, and our narrator realizes that at about the same time he realizes he’s head over heels for her.

Bruce flips the chorus, and when it’s delivered by the narrator it lands as a desperate plea rather than an ultimatum.

*Baby when you smile at me*
*Well, it make me feel so good inside*
*When you walk and you talk and you while away your time with me*
*Ah you know that’s what I like*
*Well you look so soft but you talk so loud*
*Oh you were a young girl, just out of school*
*And when you walked away, you walked so proud*
*I had to guess that was your ruling*
*Well how was I to know that all the time I loved ya*
*You were only fooling*
*Well you gotta make up your mind, girl*
*You’d better do it in time, babe*
*It’s me or you, you got to choose*
*Somebody’s got to lose*

We take an instrumental break here, because this is The Bruce Springsteen Band, and every BSB song must have a Sancious keyboard solo and a Springsteen guitar solo–a good thing in almost any situation, but it works especially well here as a way to hold the listener’s suspense before Bruce finally reveals the fate of our lovers.

It doesn’t end well, of course.

*Hey baby when I walk with you*
*Ah you make me feel just fine*
*But when I talk to you*
*I can’t read between your lines*
*Well how was I to know you were just a lonely teenager*
*You were a young girl just out of school*
*And I was like a man on the hunt*
*Yes I tried to cage her*
*But you said no, I guess I wasn’t worth it*
**Make Up Your Mind**d away*
*I knew you weren’t fooling then babe*
*Ah you gotta make up your mind*
*You gotta do it in time*
*It’s me or you, make up your mind, babe*
*Do it for me in time*
*You got to choose*
*Somebody’s got to lose*

Bruce reminds us of the age difference and power imbalance before giving his narrator his just desserts as the girl accepts his ultimatum, makes up her mind, and walks away.

“Make Up Your Mind” appeared only briefly in Bruce’s sets. As far as we know the band played it only during their month-long residency in Richmond in February 1972.

Both musically and lyrically, it stands alone (except for that “talk so loud/walked so proud” couplet, which would make its way onto Bruce’s second album the following year), a brief dalliance that was nice while it lasted–just like those summer romances.
