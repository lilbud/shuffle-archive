In December 2013, a previously unknown page of original Bruce Springsteen lyrics appeared on an auction site.
Entitled “Want Me,” the song lyrics are written in pencil on a notebook page. The page is undated but almost certainly stems from his pre-Columbia Records days.

The lyrics are a bit tough to make out, but my best guess is below:
*You want me, yes, you want me*
*I can see it all over your face*
*I wish I could help you*
*But I’ve already found my place*
*You see I have this thing to do*
*And I can’t be in one woman’s arms*
*But I’m not a bronc, so don’t act thrown*
*Cause sometimes I get so alone*
*And that’s when you’re good for me*
*You mean it, yes, you mean it*
*You mean every damn word you say*
*I hear you, I hear you*
*Telling me every day*
*You see I’m not the man who you want me to be*
*I’m not even sure who he is*
*So see first things first, babe and that sure ain’t you*
*You see the good, this big thing to do*
*But sometimes I get lonely and you’re good to me*
It’s the song of a (very) young man, that’s for sure. If it’s rooted in real life, it’s almost certainly a reflection of Bruce’s determination to succeed as a musician and not be tied down by a romantic interest. (See “[Turn Around](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/07/09/roll-of-the-dice-turn-around/)” for another early example of Bruce working through his tug-of-war between professional aspiration and romantic entanglement.
Maddeningly, that’s all we get–there’s a “(cont)” at the bottom of the page, but if there’s any more to the song, it’s been lost to history.
