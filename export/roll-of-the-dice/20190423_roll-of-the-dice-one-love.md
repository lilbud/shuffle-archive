Bruce’s recording sessions for what would become *Born in the U.S.A.* spanned more than two years. “[Cover Me](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/01/13/roll-of-the-dice-cover-me/)” (recorded in January, 1982) would end up as the earliest recorded song on the album; “[Dancing in the Dark](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/12/25/roll-of-the-dice-dancing-in-the-dark/)” would complete the album when it was recorded almost 25 months later.

By the halfway mark in early 1983, Bruce had already written, recorded, and assembled enough material to release as an album–and he came fairly close to doing so, under a working title of *Murder Incorporated.*

The track list is fascinating–it includes half of the songs that would eventually comprise *Born in the U.S.A.,* but it also included a handful of *very* strong contenders that have become fan favorites since their eventual release on *Greatest Hits* and *Tracks* years later:

What an album that would have been!

Bruce was so far along in planning the *Murder Incorporated* album, in fact, that he even had a handful of B-sides selected for the album’s first five singles. Those B-sides included two songs Bruce would eventually debut during the Born in the U.S.A. Tour (“Sugarland” and “Follow That Dream”), along with three others that still have yet to see the light of day: “[Don’t Back Down](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/01/06/roll-of-the-dice-dont-back-down/),” “[Little Girl (Like You)](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/06/15/roll-of-the-dice-little-girl-like-you/),” and “One Love.”

When I wrote about “[Little Girl (Like You)](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/06/15/roll-of-the-dice-little-girl-like-you/)” last spring, I wasn’t very kind in my assessment. “One Love” is better (faint praise that may be), but it still suffers from an overly simple conceit, a lack of imagination, and Bruce’s newfound fascination with drum machines. Take a listen:

“One Love” doesn’t demand much in the way of lyrical analysis; Bruce never even dips a toe into metaphor.

*One girl, one love*
*One dream in our heart*
*Two hearts as one*
*One hope, never to be torn apart*

*Yeah, come on baby, rock me the way I love*
*Shake me darling, shake me, don’t let me go*
*You’re the one, yeah, you’re the one for me*

By the time we’ve finished that first verse, we pretty much get the idea: like the man says (here and elsewhere), two hearts are better than one. But just to make sure that we don’t miss the point, the song continues:

*One dream, one dream*
**One Love**s all I need*
*One reason to believe*
*In you, I’ve found the thing I need*

*Once I was alone*
*So alone, so all alone*
*Then you came along*
*With a love you said I could call home*

*Come on baby, rock me all night long*
*I’ve been searching for you for so long*
*You’re the one, yeah, you’re the one for me*

Perhaps Bruce worked on the song a bit more after recording the home demo above. Maybe we’ll find out if we ever get the long-rumored *Born in the U.S.A.* anniversary box set.

But as it stands now, the best we can say about “One Love” is that it’s a simple but earnest, bouncy love song that probably wouldn’t have stood the test of time had it been released as a B-side as intended back in the mid-eighties.
