Some days the dice let you down. But being the completist that I am…
“Black Sun Rising” is a *very* early Springsteen composition. To my knowledge it was never recorded in a studio, and Bruce only performed it twice, both times in 1970, during his Steel Mill era.
The only known recording is virtually unintelligible, so I’m not even going to begin to take it apart and analyze it. Feel free to give it a listen if you want to try, but I’ll understand if you sit this one out.

[Springsteenlyrics.com](http://Springsteenlyrics.com) got further than I did figuring out the lyrics–enough to figure out that it’s a very unsubtle, of-the-time polemic:
*Well there’s a black sun risin’*
*Shining darkness on the White House*
*Well there’s a black sun risin’*
*Shining darkness on the White House*
*Turn on the white light protection, come on*
*Now there’s a new day dawn*
*When no-one’s gonna pay the cost*
*They never ???*
*???*
*Oh revolution is ours*
*Man has told me to propagate love*
*I’m gonna get you, oh, oh, oh, oh, all right*
Yeah, this is one rarity I don’t need to hear in concert.
Just rolled the dice again and got something from the HT/LT era that’s much easier to work with. Look for it soon.
