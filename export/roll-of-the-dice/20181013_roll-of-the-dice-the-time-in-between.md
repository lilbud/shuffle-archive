“The Time In Between” is a masterpiece of minimalism, a meta-commentary on the moments that separate the tracks on an album.
Or the posts on a blog.
Okay, I admit it: I need a break today to recover from jetlag, so just enjoy this scrap of a song that never was, recorded by Bruce at home home in in late 1979. See you tomorrow!
