Bruce adapted classic literature in song long before “[The Ghost of Tom Joad.](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/10/17/roll-of-the-dice-the-ghost-of-tom-joad/)”

In the autumn of 1968, nineteen-year-old Bruce Springsteen put pen to paper and wrote a song called “Mississippi,” featuring two friends drifting down the great river on a raft on a beautiful, lazy summer day. One of them was named Jim, and although the narrator never identifies himself, it’s not too difficult to figure out his name, too.

*Sailing down the Mississippi*
*Chewing on a piece of hay*
*Just ain’t nothing like my river*
*On such a beautiful day*

*Brother Jim lying right beside me*
*Everything’s feeling just fine*
*‘Cause we’re as free as the river*
*Faithful by each other’s side*

*The sun feels mighty good this morning*
*Gonna be a good day I can see*
*Its gentle rays are mighty warmin’*
*Why don’t you come along with Jim and me*

*Plenty of fish to make good eatin’*
*Lots of room upon the raft*
*Now that you’re friends with the river*
*Maybe you’ll never go back*

*Put down the load you been carrying*
*Follow me and don’t look back*
*Jim’s just about got supper cookin’*
*Plenty of room upon the raft*

*Forget about time for there’s no reason*
*To worry about things like that*
*The days just melt into seasons*
*There is no future or past*

**Mississippi**s our roof top*
*Travelin’ on just another mile*
*Don’t think I’m ever gonna stop*
*Can’t do nothing now but smile and smile*

Bruce never recorded his adaptation of *Adventures of Huckleberry Finn*, but he did include some margin notes (for example, “Instead of A minor use D”) that at least tell us he envisioned “Mississippi” as a song rather than a poem.
