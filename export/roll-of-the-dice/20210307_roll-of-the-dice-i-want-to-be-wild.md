This one is (as they say) for the collectors.

About a year-and-a-half ago, we took a listen to Bruce’s unreleased 1977 outtake “[Don’t Say No](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/10/15/roll-of-the-dice-dont-say-no/),” and scratched our heads trying to make heads or tails of Bruce’s vocals, which were buried so far down in the mix that they challenge even the most astute of listeners.

It had a killer backing track, though, and I mentioned at the time that Bruce wouldn’t give up on finding a home for it over the next couple of years.

Well, this is Bruce’s next attempt. In “I Want to Be Wild,” the E Street Band takes a leap forward, tightening up the backing track, adding a wonderful Big Man sax solo, and a terrific mid-song drum break.

Unfortunately, though, Bruce now sounds like he’s singing underwater… when we can hear him singing at all.

We can make out enough of the constantly repeated chorus to agree that Bruce is singing “I wanna be wild,” but that’s about all I can decrypt.

What follows is a transcription from the kind folks at springsteenlyrics.com, but don’t ask me to vouch for it–I can’t make out even a fraction of what they purport to. (And what they do transcribe doesn’t make a whole lot of sense to me.)

*I’m staying, I’m staying, but baby you’re killing me*
*And you know, you darlin’, you better now make it on time*
*And I want a forever and ever with you around*
*You’re running with speed and, uh, you better learn to work hard*
*There’s nothing at all, no one’s like us, no one is there outside*

*O-oh*
*I wanna be wild*
*I wanna be wild*
*I wanna be wild*
*I wanna be wild*

*Hey maybe you’re cool but baby you’re both’rin me*
*And only you can put me out of my misery*
*And I go out in the street for my love every time*
*And I wanna show love swinging round, when you’re around*
*I don’t remember, maybe you’ve been feelin’ a motor outside*

*Oooh wild*
*I wanna be wild*
*I wanna be wild*
*I wanna be wild*

*Big Man!*

*Right now I wanna drive wild*
*And I wanna drive wild*
*And I wanna be wild*
*And I wanna go wild*
*And I wanna go wild*
*And I wanna go wild*
*And I wanna go wild*
**I Want to Be Wild**d*
*Want you to kiss me wild*
*And I wanna be wild*
*And I wanna go wild*
*And I wanna be wild*
*And I wanna see wild*
*And I wanna feel wild*
*And I wanna be wild*
*And I wanna be wild*
*It’s up to you, no one knows, no one is there outside*

So, yeah… sure. We’ll go with that.

Assuming we take the above as gospel, it’s easy to see why Bruce didn’t include this 1977 outtake on [*Darkness on the Edge of Town*](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/07/05/album-companion-darkness-on-the-edge-of-town/). It would have been more at home on *The River,* and it does seem like Bruce tried at least once more to find a home for his instrumental track during those sessions, too.

We’ll pick up that thread another time.
