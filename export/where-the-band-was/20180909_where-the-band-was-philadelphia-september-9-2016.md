The big question in my mind coming out of [Night One in Philadelphia](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/09/07/where-the-band-was-philadelphia-september-7-2016/): how do you top a show that includes “New York City Serenade,” “[Lost in the Flood](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/02/20/roll-of-the-dice-lost-in-the-flood/),” “[Kitty’s Back](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/01/22/roll-of-the-dice-kittys-back/), “[Incident on 57th Street](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/12/14/roll-of-the-dice-incident-on-57th-street/),” “[The Fever,](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/10/04/roll-of-the-dice-the-fever/)” “[Thundercrack](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/09/24/roll-of-the-dice-thundercrack/), “[Downbound Train](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/01/22/roll-of-the-dice-downbound-train/),” “[Streets of Philadelphia](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/06/30/roll-of-the-dice-streets-of-philadelphia/),” and “Jungleland” on Night Two?
Or would this be the exception that disproves the Night One/Night Two truism?
Turns out you top it by keeping a couple of those gems, like the by-now standard “New York City Serenade” opener (that still feels so strange to write)…

…swapping out the rest for genuine by-request wild cards (missing entirely from Night One) like “From Small Things (Big Things One Day Come),” “[I’m Goin’ Down](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/06/05/roll-of-the-dice-im-goin-down/),” and “[Loose Ends](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/06/23/roll-of-the-dice-loose-end/)” (played in succession early in the set)…

…sharing the stage an old friend (even if he looked a little lost up there)…

…and a young fan (who couldn’t have seemed more at home)…

…and then performing what is easily the most exquisite “[Racing in the Street](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/10/03/roll-of-the-dice-racing-in-the-street/)” I’ve ever had the privilege to witness.

And it doesn’t hurt to restart my streak of getting at least one personal premiere per show going again, by playing my first “[Lucky Town](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/05/24/roll-of-the-dice-lucky-town/).”

I only have one regret from this show: Bruce was slated to start the encore with “[Secret Garden](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/05/30/roll-of-the-dice-secret-garden/)” which by this point was at the very top of my chase list (this tour had knocked off pretty much everything else), but for some reason Bruce decided to play “[Streets of Philadelphia](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/06/30/roll-of-the-dice-streets-of-philadelphia/)” for a second night running.

I saw six of the ten shows on this final leg of the tour, and yet I still managed to miss “[Secret Garden](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/05/30/roll-of-the-dice-secret-garden/),” which was played at 3 of the 4 shows I missed. But that’s a minor complaint, and one that seems ridiculous in light of a magnificent eight-song encore that also included “[Backstreets](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/05/14/roll-of-the-dice-backstreets/)” and a show-closing “[Jersey Girl](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/07/24/cover-me-roll-of-the-dice-jersey-girl/)” with fireworks.

And if the show didn’t set another longest-ever record, that was just fine, too: that night in Philly was one of the most humid I can remember at a show, and by the end of the night I was drenched and exhausted–it was Friday night, and I’d already seen three four-hour-ish shows that week without taking a single day off of work.
And I still had one more show to go that weekend–one that would be my last E Street show to date.
