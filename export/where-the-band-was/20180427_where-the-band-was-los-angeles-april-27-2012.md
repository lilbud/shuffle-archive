Every Springsteen show has at least one special moment. You never know what it will be–maybe a never-before-played song, maybe a special guest or a special request, maybe a performance that goes off-the-rails and way past curfew. You also never know exactly *when* it will be.
At Night 2 of the 2012 stand at the LA Sports Arena, that moment came 90 minutes before the show even started: after the few hundred of us in the pit had been let in, we settled in for what is usually a long, boring wait for the show to start. But within minutes, a pre-wardrobe and makeup Bruce Springsteen strolled out onto the stage to give his relatives a guided tour. And then this happened… (and remember there were only hundreds of us in the arena at that time).

It was the closest I may ever get to a private Bruce concert. I’d heard about Bruce’s rare pre-shows before, but I never expected to see one, let alone at a venue like the Sports Arena.
When Bruce and the band opened the show with the tour premiere of “[No Surrender](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/11/18/roll-of-the-dice-no-surrender/)” ninety minutes later, the crowd energy was off the charts.

On paper, the main set was unremarkable, but the intensity level was high. Tom Morello made four non-consecutive appearances throughout the show, “[Racing in the Street](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/10/03/roll-of-the-dice-racing-in-the-street/)” had a rare outing, and even “[Waitin’ on a Sunny Day](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/09/27/roll-of-the-dice-waitin-on-a-sunny-day/)” was special–watch Bruce fake out Kevin Buell to mark the occasion of his 1,000th show.

The encores held one more special moment: the tour premiere of and Jake Clemons’ first outing on [“Bobby Jean](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/06/19/roll-of-the-dice-bobby-jean/).” I’m sure the return of “Jungleland” much later was more emotional, but this was still quite the moment–you can see the satisfaction on Bruce’s face and you can tell how much that moment meant to Jake.

I’ve been fortunate enough to have seen some fantastic shows at the L.A. Sports Arena, but (pre-)start to finish, this will always be one of the most memorable.
