Did anyone really *not* expect Bruce to turn up when The Gaslight Anthem played Asbury Park’s Convention Hall on their American Slang Tour?
I mean, I’m not even sure it’s possible to find a story about the band or an interview with Brian Fallon (their lead singer) that doesn’t make the Springsteen comparison.
Bruce even admitted in an interview with Simon Mayo that if he was ever taken out of commission before a show, he’d draft Fallon to stand in for him.

Bruce had already appeared on stage with Brian twice just two years prior, joining the band for their title track when they toured behind “[The ’59 Sound](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/01/27/meeting-across-the-river-gaslight-anthem-and-bruce-springsteen-the-59-sound/).”
When the band came through Asbury in 2011, Bruce once again joined them for their title track–but this time the album was their follow-up, *American Slang.*

Bruce made his surprise appearance mid-set, and the sold-out local crowd (including Fallon’s proud mother) went wild. Bruce contributed rhythm guitar and backing vocals to the band’s performance, as well as a shot of pure adrenaline.

That performance turned out to be the last time Brian and Bruce would perform together on stage (to date, at least), but if we’re not lucky enough to get an encore someday, at least that last one was a high-water mark.
