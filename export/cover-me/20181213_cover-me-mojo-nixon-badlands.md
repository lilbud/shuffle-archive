Thanks to Jason Luttrull for bringing this one to my attention!
I’m a big fan of Mojo Nixon’s cover of “[The Big Payback](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/11/11/roll-of-the-dice-the-big-payback/)” from his first album with Skid Roper, and I’ve long wished he’d take a run at another song from Bruce’s catalog.
Little did I know he’d already done so back in 1997–sort of.
Turns out that while rehearsing for his *Sock Ray Blue* album in the studio, his rehearsal sessions included a rough cut of “[Badlands](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/05/20/roll-of-the-dice-badlands/),” The song never made it on the album, but it’s a bold, fresh (but still just as fierce) arrangement that deserves to be heard. Take a listen:
