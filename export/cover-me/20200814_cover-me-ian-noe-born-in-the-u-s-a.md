A couple of weeks ago, we featured a new, poignant cover of “[Born in the U.S.A.](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/09/21/roll-of-the-dice-born-in-the-u-s-a/)” by Stories (the folks behind Scary Pockets).
It’s a beautiful cover ([go check it out](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/07/17/cover-me-stories-featuring-garrison-starr/) if you missed it), but it made me recall one of my favorite “Born in the U.S.A.” covers that I hadn’t listened to in some time.
Ian Noe has covered “Born in the U.S.A.” pretty frequently in concert, as recently as last year. But my favorite performance of his is one from 2013, and it still holds up. He was only 23 at the time, but he’d found the soul of Bruce’s song.
Take a listen and enjoy.

Ian’s own music is pretty great, too–if you’re a John Prine fan, check out Ian’s debut album from last year, *Between the Country,* [here](https://www.iannoe.com/).
