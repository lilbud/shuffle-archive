Bruce Springsteen wasn’t the only Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee in 1999.
Among the other legends welcomed into the Hall that year were Billy Joel and Sir Paul McCartney. Both icons were present along with Bruce for the induction ceremony on March 15th, and all three were on stage for the traditional closing jam.
When you’ve got a Beatle with you on stage, you really can’t close with anything other than a Beatles song. For this occasion, the all-star jam band chose the last single The Beatles released before they broke up: their 1970 number one hit, “Let It Be.”

On this historic night, it was Billy Joel who started off the performance: he sings the first verse at the piano (with Roy Bittan by his side). McCartney arrives on stage in time for the first chorus, and from that point forward, the song rightfully belongs to him.

Bruce was definitely in a supporting role that night. Clearly star-struck, Bruce looked perfectly content just to be there in any capacity.
Although Bruce has played with Paul McCartney several times since, that was their first time on stage together and the only time Bruce has ever performed “Let It Be.”
