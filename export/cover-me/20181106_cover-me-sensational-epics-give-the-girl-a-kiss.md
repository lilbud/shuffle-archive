The Sensational Epics hail from Columbia, South Carolina and date back to the early 1960s. A favorite on the southern college and beach circuit, their horn-fueled sound, on-stage presence and charisma make them a perfect fit to cover Bruce’s poppier tunes.
If you’re not familiar with the Epics, here’s a vintage reel of a performance from 1966–they’re still around and performing today.

In 2002, the Sensational Epics released their *Been There, Ain’t Done Yet* album, and their lead-off track was an obscure Springsteen song buried deep in the heart of Disc One of *Tracks.*
Stop what you’re doing, turn the volume up, and don’t try to resist the urge to sing and dance along to the Sensational Epics performing Bruce’s “[Give the Girl a Kiss.](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/06/17/roll-of-the-dice-give-the-girl-a-kiss/)”
