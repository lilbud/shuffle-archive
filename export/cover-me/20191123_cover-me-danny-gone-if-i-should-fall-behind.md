I realize that Springsteen covers are a mixed bag; just because we love the song when performed by its original artists doesn’t mean the song translates well to others.
But trust me on this: stop what you’re doing for a minute, and listen to this absolutely gorgeous cover of “[If I Should Fall Behind](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/06/01/roll-of-the-dice-if-i-should-fall-behind/),” one of Bruce’s finest songs. It’s brand new (released just days ago as I write this), but it’s immediately cemented as one of my top ten Springsteen covers of all-time.

I’m unfamiliar with Danny Gone’s original work, but you can bet I’m going to seek it out after listening to his tender arrangement and mesmerizing performance.
Well done, Mr. Gone. *Very* well done.
