They weren’t the Belmonts, but they’d do in a pinch.
On the evening of December 13, 1987, Paul Simon organized a benefit concert at Madison Square Garden in order to raise awareness and money to fight homelessness among New York City’s children.
The announced line-up was stellar on its own: Simon, of course, along with his Graceland tour mates Ladysmith Black Mambazo; James Taylor, Chaka Khan, Reuben Blades, Dion DiMucci, and Lou Reed were on the bill, too.
But it was the unadvertised guests during Dion’s set that sent the crowd through the roof: along with Paul Simon, Lou Reed, James Taylor, and Reuben Blades, Dion surprised the crowd by inviting Billy Joel and Bruce Springsteen to be his honorary Belmonts for the evening.
Together, the all-star ensemble performed Dion’s 1959 classic, “A Teenager in Love.” (Watch to the end to see Bruce get in one last doo-wop hook.)

“A Teenager in Love” peaked at #5 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1959. It was one of Dion’s greatest hits and is almost universally known and loved to this day.
