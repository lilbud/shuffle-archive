“Catch the Wind” might seem like a strange candidate for a Castiles setlist.

True, Donovan’s first single was a decent hit, charting at #23 in the US and all the way to #4 in the UK. But the 1965 song was a tender acoustic ballad about unrequited love, and that seemed an ill fit for The Castiles’ rock sensibilities.

But cover it the boys did, showing admirable restraint and letting Bruce’s warm, impassioned vocals take center stage.

Fortunately, their performance was captured on tape, so we can listen to the only known time Bruce has played “Catch the Wind” — at The Left Foot in Freehold, more than 50 years ago.
