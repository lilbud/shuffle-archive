This.
For anyone who thinks “[57 Channels (And Nothin’ On)](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/05/17/roll-of-the-dice-57-channels-and-nothin-on/)” sizzles on vinyl but fizzled on stage, *this* is how you capture the dystopian alienation of Bruce’s original without distorting it into the production number it became during Bruce’s 1992-1993 tour.

Melancon did more than just cover “57 Channels” live–he released it on his latest album, *Pinkville*, as well.

*Pinkville* is a strong collection of gritty southern rock, featuring a collection of original songs dark and twisted enough to sound like an electric *Nebraska*.
Rod’s cover of “57 Channels (An Nothin’ On)” fits so seamlessly on the album that it makes you realize just how at home the original would have been on *Nebraska* as well, in a different arrangement.
