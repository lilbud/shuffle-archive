If you’re a Little Steven fan, today’s entry is a true treat.
Way back in 1972, long before Steve joined the E Street Band (heck, before there even *was* an E Street Band), Steve co-led (with Southside Johnny) a short-lived band called The Sundance Blues Band. The band also included Garry Tallent, Dave Sancious, and Vini Lopez.
For a brief time (and I mean *brief–*he didn’t even last two months), Bruce was a member of the band, too. But even after Bruce left to form a band named after himself, he still made occasional guest appearances with Sundance.
Those guest appearances included the band’s final shows at The Captain’s Garter in Neptune, New Jersey before disbanding in January 1972.
On at least one of those evenings, the band covered the great blues song “You Know My Love,” originally recorded by Otis Rush but written by Willie Dixon.

Although Bruce was present that night and would sing lead vocals on at least two of the songs played that night, it was Steve who took the vocal spotlight on “You Know My Love,” with Bruce contributing rhythm guitar.
Amazingly (who could have known the historical significance at the time?), that performance was captured on tape, and the recording quality is just astounding for its age.
Listen below and take it all in: Steve’s amazing vocals, Southside’s wailing harp, Sancious’ virtuosic keyboard solo. As strange as it sounds to say: Bruce’s contributions are the least impressive thing about this performance.

Just days later, The Sundance Blues Band was no more, although almost all of the players were also in The Bruce Springsteen Band, which continued on for another six months. And of course, within a year, Bruce would secure a recording contract, and The Bruce Springsteen Band would give way to the band that would eventually name themselves E Street.
But for a brief moment in time, the upstarts who would eventually become rock icons had a decidedly blues bent. If only we had more surviving recordings of it.
