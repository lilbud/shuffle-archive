I don’t know much about The Blue Bonnets other than that they contributed to the excellent *For You* Italian tribute album back in 1995.
But their contribution wasn’t just another of the countless “[I’m on Fire](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/09/11/roll-of-the-dice-im-on-fire/)” or “[Dancing in the Dark](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/12/25/roll-of-the-dice-dancing-in-the-dark/)” renditions out there… these guys get serious bonus points for digging *deep* in Bruce’s catalog and selecting a song that almost no one ever touches: “[The Angel](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/09/26/roll-of-the-dice-the-angel/),” from Bruce’s very first album.
Not many fans would rank “[The Angel](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/09/26/roll-of-the-dice-the-angel/)” very high in Bruce’s catalog, but if Bruce had arranged the song like the Blue Bonnets did, I bet a whole lot more would. Take a listen:

That’s a seriously good arrangement and performance–so much so that it I wish Bruce would give it a go in concert next time around.
If anyone has any other information about this band, I’d love to know.
