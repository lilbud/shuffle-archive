George Harrison passed away on November 29, 2001, just a few days before Bruce Springsteen was set to kick off a festive run of holiday shows in Asbury Park. It was a tradition he’d started only a year prior with a pair of holiday benefits, and this year–so soon after the September 11th terror attacks–his community was in serious need of both succor and celebration.
But when a Beatle passes, there’s really no other choice for a rock and roll musician but to pay one’s respects.
So that’s exactly what Bruce did, by opening his first show with a cover of one of Harrison’s songs. And although George left no shortage of songs from which to choose, there was really only one obvious choice.
Harrison wrote “Something” for The Beatles’ *Abbey Road* album, and when it was issued as a single with “[Come Together](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/01/15/meeting-across-the-river-bruce-springsteen-and-axl-rose/)” on the flip-side, it became his first-ever A-side and not only topped the Billboard Hot 100 but also went to #1 in Canada, Australia, West Germany, and New Zealand.

“Something” quickly became The Beatles’ second most-covered song (after “Yesterday”) and the 17th most-performed song of the 20th century. Bruce made sure it was carried into the 21st as well.
On December 3rd 2001, Bruce took the stage with his acoustic guitar, and together with Soozie Tyrell on violin and Patti Scialfa on backing vocals, they played a sad but achingly beautiful cover of “Something.”

It was a beautiful arrangement, one that captured the emotion of both the song and the moment. And it was only a moment, because Bruce immediately segued into a more upbeat cover of Harrison’s “[My Sweet Lord](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/11/25/cover-me-my-sweet-lord/)” before diving into a festive holiday set list for the rest of the evening.
To this day, it remains the only time Bruce has covered “Something” in concert.
