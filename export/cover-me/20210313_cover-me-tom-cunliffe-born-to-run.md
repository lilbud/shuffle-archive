With a couple of albums under his belt, Auckland-based folk-rocker Tom Cunliffe has established himself as a great singer-songwriter.
In a recent interview for [*The Influences*](https://theinfluences.com/)(a brilliant web site dedicated to artists covering songs that influenced them, which I recommend to anyone who likes great music from musicians who appreciate great music), Cunliffe revealed where his inspirations derive from.
Among the artists in heavy rotation in his parents’ home while he was growing up was Bruce Springsteen, which may be why Bruce’s signature song was one of two covers Cunliffe chose to perform for his *Influences* session.
Cunliffe’s reading of “Born to Run” is wistful and nostalgic rather than defiant and anthemic like Bruce’s original–but it’s just as 100% sincere.

Cunliffe’s cover of “Born to Run” may be gently acoustic, but his original studio tracks rock. Check out more of his music [here](https://tomcunliffemusic.com/).
