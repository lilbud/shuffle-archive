Fans attending Little Steven’s *Soulfire* record release show at the Count Basie Theater were no doubt delighted when Bruce Springsteen made a late on-stage appearance, but they probably weren’t surprised. Bruce often turns up when his lifelong friend performs locally.

They probably weren’t shocked by the song selection, either: Bruce and Steve have performed “It’s Been a Long Time” and “[I Don’t Want to Go Home](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/03/30/meeting-across-the-river-bruce-springsteen-and-steve-van-zandt-i-dont-want-to-go-home/)” together many times, and “[Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/11/19/roll-of-the-dice-tenth-avenue-freeze-out/)” too may times to count.

But the show’s encore–now *that* was different.

Bruce played Marvin Gaye’s “Can I Get a Witness” once before, a decade earlier at a private benefit concert. However, no recording circulates from that performance.

Gaye’s original only peaked at #22 on the Billboard Hot 100, but it lasted sixteen weeks on the chart, making it one of Gaye’s longest-lasting hits if not his most popular. And it was certainly one of his best to dance to.

So when the Disciples of Soul launched into that unmistakable boogie-woogie-meets-soul riff, the crowd went nuts.

That show closing-performance was a genuine one-off (for Bruce, anyway–Steve has played it often). It was a highlight to cap a night full of them, ushering in a prolific two-and-a-half years for one of rock’s best touring bands.
