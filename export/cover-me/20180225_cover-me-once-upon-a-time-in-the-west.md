A rare instrumental cover by Bruce, “Once Upon a Time in the West” is a composition by Italian composer Ennio Morricone. Bruce has often used it as walk-on music in Italy, and in 2006 he recorded a solo electric guitar instrumental version at his home studio.
Italian conductor Luigi Caiola arranged an orchestral overlay and recorded the the Unione Musicisti Di Roma performing it.
The result was an absolutely gorgeous and romantic piece of music, officially released on a Morricone tribute album in February 2007.
