It’s one of the most iconic songs from one of rock’s most iconic bands.
Upon release in 1987, it topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart. A quarter-century later, it was firmly lodged in Rolling Stone Magazine’s 100 Greatest Songs of All Time.
Instantly recognizable from its opening moments, “I Still Haven’t Found What I’m Looking For” has become one of U2’s signature songs, played on every tour.

A marriage of rock and gospel, “I Still Haven’t Found What I’m Looking For” was downright beckoning Bruce to cover it, but he never has–perhaps because it’s *too* closely associated with the band that originated it.
He did, however, perform it *with* Bono and the boys–on four separate occasions, in fact, and always in New York City. The first time, fittingly, was to honor U2 at their Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony in 2005. You couldn’t tell by Bono’s performance, however–for all the world, you’d think he was honoring Bruce.

Four years later, Bruce and Bono reunited at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame 25th Anniversary Concerts. This time Bruce wasn’t the only E Streeter to sit in with U2–Roy Bittan joined the band as well, and the professor’s piano added a layer of majesty to the proceedings. Bruce and Bono traded vocals on the last verse, elevating an already stellar performance, and Bono finished with a grace note, weaving the chorus of Bruce’s thematically related “[The Promised Land](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/07/04/roll-of-the-dice-the-promised-land/)” with Bruce’s final vocals.
This remains one of my favorite Springsteen/U2 performances:

How do you top two guest performances like those? Well, when the opportunity presents itself, you take the lead.
In 2014, U2 was scheduled to give a free performance in Times Square to observe World AIDS Day, but two weeks before the gig, Bono broke his arm in a motorcycle accident. Unwilling to cancel the performance, Bono called in a few favors, and U2 took the stage as scheduled, but with temporary frontmen: Bruce and Chris Martin each took a turn at the microphone, and one of Bruce’s numbers was… well, by now you know.

The love-fest continued most recently in 2015, when Bruce made a surprise appearance at U2’s Madison Square Garden gig. Bono surely embarrassed Bruce, citing how much of an influence he was on the band, and how much he appreciated Bruce’s guest frontman turn above. When Bruce took the stage to thunderous applause, what else could they sing together but “I Still Haven’t Found What I’m Looking For.”
