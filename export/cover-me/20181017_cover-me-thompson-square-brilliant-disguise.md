Country duo Thompson Square are husband and wife. Maybe that’s why their take on “[Brilliant Disguise](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/02/06/roll-of-the-dice-brilliant-disguise/)” has a very different feel than turns taken by other artists.
Bruce has often stated that the song takes on a different meaning if you sing it with the right person:
*“When you sing this song with someone you love, it turns into something else… a reaffirmation of loves’ mysteries, its shadows, frailties and acceptance of those frailties, without which there is no love.”*
Keifer and Shawna Thompson certainly capture that spirit here.
