They may be a folk trio, but this cover rocks.
The Descendants hail from South Africa’s Eastern Cape. With twelve studio albums under their belts, Ingrid Potgieter (piano), Nicky Wilson (bass), and Melissa Larter (guitar and lead vocals) have amassed a considerable catalog of inspirational songs.
And when it comes to covers, they don’t get more inspirational than Bruce Springsteen’s “[Land of Hope and Dreams](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/01/05/roll-of-the-dice-land-of-hope-and-dreams/).”

Their version (recorded live) starts simply and acoustically, but just past the halfway point the song opens up, and the band takes off and never looks back. It’s a fine addition to the collection of covers of one of Bruce’s very best songs.
