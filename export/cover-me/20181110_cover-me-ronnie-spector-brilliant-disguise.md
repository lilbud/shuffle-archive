Here’s a Springsteen cover that’s flown largely under the radar… perhaps deservedly so.
Don’t get me wrong: I’m a huge Ronnie Spector fan, and it’s nice to hear her take a run at one of Bruce’s songs given their long association and friendship.
And “[Brilliant Disguise](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/02/06/roll-of-the-dice-brilliant-disguise/)” is actually a pretty neat choice for her; she’s so closely associated with the more innocent crush/love songs of the sixties, that it’s fascinating to hear her tackle a song that grapples with the reality of relationships.
Her voice is in fine form on this 2001 recording, and I have no problem with artists flipping the gender of a song’s lyrics, even though it shouldn’t really be necessary.
But, Ronnie… that coda.
You had me until the coda. That was unforgivable.
Whoa-oh-oh-oh indeed.
