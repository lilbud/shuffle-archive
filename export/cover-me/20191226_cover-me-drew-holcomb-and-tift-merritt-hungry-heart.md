There was always a country song deep down in Bruce Springsteen’s “[Hungry Heart](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/12/21/roll-of-the-dice-hungry-heart/),” and Drew Holcomb and Tift Merritt found it back in 2017 when they appeared together on [an episode of eTown](https://www.etown.org/broadcasts/drew-holcomb-neighbors-tift-merritt/).
Skip past the first minute of rehearsal footage if you must, but don’t miss their gorgeous cover performance that follows–it’s one of my favorite covers of a Springsteen song.

When I first heard Holcomb and Merritt’s performance, it was a revelation—their arrangement of “Hungry Heart” feels so natural, so perfectly suited to the lyrics that I have to wonder whether Bruce ever envisioned it that way himself.
