“Go Go Go (Down the Line)” is far from my favorite Roy Orbison song, but it’s certainly one of my favorite highlights from Orbison’s *Black and White Night* concert–if only for the sight of a completely starstruck Bruce Springsteen (with an “I can’t believe this is actually happening” expression the entire time) playing alongside one of his idols.

Bruce was a week past his 38th birthday when this clip was recorded, but that smile (especially at the 3:20 mark) is the smile of an awestruck kid.

“Go Go Go (Down the Line)” was actually Orbison’s very first self-penned song. released as the rockabilly B-side to “[Ooby Dooby](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/07/11/matr-roy-orbison-bruce-springsteen-and-friends-ooby-dooby/)” in 1956. It wasn’t a hit at the time, but it attracted notable cover artists like The Hollies, The Drifters, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Johnny Cash over the years.

In my opinion, though, nothing matches that one-time-only performance with Roy, Bruce, Elvis Costello, Tom Waits and more. I can only imagine how Bruce felt, because every time I watch this concert, I can’t believe it actually happened either.
