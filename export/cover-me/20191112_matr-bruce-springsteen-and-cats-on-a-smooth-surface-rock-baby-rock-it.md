Johnny Carroll is one of rockabilly’s unsung heroes.

He never had a hit during his original run in the 1950s, but he was a critical darling and had a resurgence of sorts in the late seventies and early eighties.

Caroll does have the distinction, however, of not only appearing in one of the early rock and roll films (the ones that were light on plot and heavy on musical showcases) but also performing its title track: “Rock Baby, Rock It” from the 1957 film of the same name.

By 1982, Carroll was enjoying some long-deserved recognition, and among the musicians exposing audiences to his music were Stone Pony house band Cats on a Smooth Surface and special guest star Bruce Springsteen.
**First performed:**
Throughout the summer and into the fall of 1982, one of the best-kept open secrets was Bruce Springsteen’s regular but unadvertised gigs at the Stone Pony with their house band. And on a Sunday early October evening, their set included a one-off cover of “Rock Baby, Rock It.”

To this day, it remains the only time Bruce is known to have performed Carroll’s overlooked shoulda-been-a-hit.
