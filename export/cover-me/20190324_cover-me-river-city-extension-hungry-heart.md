I’m not sure that Bruce’s “[Hungry Heart](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/12/21/roll-of-the-dice-hungry-heart/)” lyrics are well-served by this cool arrangement by River City Extension… but then again, I’m not sure that Bruce’s own arrangement works particularly well either.
“Hungry Heart” has always generated some cognitive dissonance with its pop melody welded to lyrics of familial abandonment.
So how about we just give a hall pass to anyone who wants to try something new when covering it, because this cover groove by the now-defunct River City Extension out of Toms River (barely a half-hour drive from Asbury Park) is too great to fault for style.
Play it over your Sunday morning coffee–that’s what I’m doing right now.
