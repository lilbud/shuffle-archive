The entries for this year’s *Cover Me* competition in Bergamo are rolling in, and there are some truly outstanding ones vying for the top prize. It’s no surprise that today’s entry is among them.
Last year, a band called The Folding Chairs took the top spot with [their bluegrass arrangement](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/06/04/cover-me-the-folding-chairs-new-york-city-serenade/) of “New York City Serenade.” It was one of my favorite entries, and both the judges and the audience seemed to agree.
The Folding Chairs are absent this year, but lead singer Ettore Cardamellis is back with a new group called Stick to the Plan! (punctuation intentional), but with a similar Seeger-esque sound.
And come on: haven’t you always wondered what a Seeger-fied (with a little bit of Blues Traveller) version of “Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)” would sound like?
Of course you have. So let’s watch, listen, and enjoy.
