The Chantays were a one-hit wonder, but their one hit was monumental.
Written by band members and guitarists Brian Carman and Bob Spickard and recorded in 1962, “Pipeline” became an instant hit, peaking at #4 on the Billboard Pop chart and cementing a place as one of the most important surf rock songs.
So popular was “Pipeline” in 1963 that The Chantays became the first and only rock band to ever perform on The Lawrence Welk show.

As far as we know, Bruce has never covered “Pipeline” in concert or in public, but he did play it at least once in private–at a rehearsal session with the E Street Band on February 22, 1980 at Bruce’s home studio.

Did I say rehearsal? If that was a rehearsal, imagine what a concert performance would have been like.
I’m not often one to proclaim a cover to be stronger than the original (especially for an acknowledged classic), but Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band absolutely owned “Pipeline” in this brief performance–the only time they are known to have played this surf rock landmark.
