Mere months after reuniting in the winter of 2000, Grammy- and VMA-winning Living Colour played the 2001 Montreaux Jazz Festival.
The band delivered a strong set, and to close the show, they chose a very special cover: Bruce’s “American Skin (41 Shots).”
If you haven’t seen this before, trust me: you need to.
The arrangement is intense and original, and Corey Glover’s vocal performance is absolutely mesmerizing. I can only imagine what was going through his mind as tears streaked down his face during the crossfire (and that’s only barely a metaphor) of Will Calhoun’s drums.

It’s not one of the most well-known Springsteen covers out there, but it’s certainly one of the strongest.
And without question, the most heartfelt.
