Now here’s a cover Bruce would certainly approve.
Amy Helm has been covering “[Atlantic City](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/06/04/roll-of-the-dice-atlantic-city/)” for years–which isn’t surprising, considering how many times she must have heard her dad’s version of it while growing up.
Amy’s father, Levon, recorded one of the best and definitive Springsteen covers with The Band; their cover of “Atlantic City” was released on their 1993 album, *Jericho*.

When Amy struck out on her own as a solo artist in 2015, “Atlantic City” was in her set lists from the beginning. Here’s her terrific acoustic cover from her performance at New York’s City Winery in 2015.

Amy has continued including “Atlantic City” in her sets right up to the present. Here’s a harder-rocking performance from last year’s FreshGrass Festival.

As a vocal and enthusiastic fan of The Band, I have to imagine Bruce deeply appreciates being part of Levon’s legacy.
Acoustic or electric, Amy does both Bruce and Levon proud.
