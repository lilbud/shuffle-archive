A good cover can make you hear a favorite song in a new light. Here’s a powerful example:
Elysium is an Irish cover band out of Wexford with a wide-ranging repertoire of acoustically arranged hits and deep cuts, featuring beautiful guitar melodies paired with gorgeous harmonies.
A few weeks ago, they released their poignant, mesmerizing cover of Bruce’s “[Drive All Night.](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/02/27/roll-of-the-dice-drive-all-night/)” By the end of it, I was in tears.

That segue you hear in the final minutes blends “Drive All Night” with the Scottish/Irish standard “The Parting Glass,” a traditional farewell to friends, family and loved ones.
By placing it in the context of “Drive All Night,” Elysium transforms Bruce’s song of young romance into something eternal: a pledge of remembrance to a love lost.
*But since it fell into my lot*
*That I should rise and you should not*
*I’ll gently rise and softly call*
*Good night and joy be to you all*
*So fill to me the parting glass*
*And drink a health whate’er befalls*
*Then gently rise and softly call*
*Good night and joy be to you all*
*Good night and joy be to you all*
Released in the midst of the great pandemic of 2020, it’s hard not to hear their performance of “Drive All Night” in a completely different light–love laced with loss. It’s simultaneously healing and heart-aching.
“Drive All Night” has long been one of my favorite Springsteen songs, and now I have yet another reason to love it. Thanks for that, Elysium.
