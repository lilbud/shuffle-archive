The Stormers are an Irish wedding band, and if the notion of a wedding band covering Bruce’s music makes you roll your eyes, just trust me and read on.
The Stormers have a unique sound (they describe it as Tom Jones crossed with U2, if either of those acts included a prominent flautist), and with more than a thousand weddings under their belt, they’ve put in their time.
A few weeks ago, the band released a new video to raise money for a new local outreach center for Pieta House, a suicide prevention and therapy organization, in their hometown of Dundalk.
Their version of Bruce’s “[My Hometown](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/04/09/roll-of-the-dice-my-hometown/)” is absolutely superb and well worth your attention. Take a listen:

The band may have only just released their video, but they’ve been working on it for a couple of years, which helps explain why it’s so well done. Here’s an earlier work-in-progress version:

If like me, you’re moved by The Stormers’ cover of “My Hometown” to donate to their worthy cause, you can do so [here](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?redir_token=NPuIzaYfILAA4I8oBJ9DTt1ho5l8MTU4OTEzMDA4OUAxNTg5MDQzNjg5&event=video_description&v=COkjjpy131I&q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gofundme.com%2Ff%2Fpieta-house-in-my-hometown).
I’m looking forward to see what these guys do next.
