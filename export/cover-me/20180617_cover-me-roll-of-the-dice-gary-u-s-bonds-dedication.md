Now here’s an usual cover for a couple of reasons:
1. Bruce never released it.
2. It’s entirely possible that this doesn’t even qualify as a cover.
Say what?
Here’s what we know:
- Bruce originally recorded “Dedication” with the E Street Band during the River sessions in 1979. That recording has never surfaced (or has it? Keep reading).
- Bruce gifted the song to Gary U.S. Bonds for his third album. It ended up serving as the title track.
- Bruce and Steve co-produced the album with Bonds, so they had a very strong hand in the final product.
- The backing musicians for the album included Bruce, Steve, Roy, Clarence, Danny, Garry, and Max–in other words, the entire E Street Band. Several other musicians contributed their talents as well.
- When you listen to “Dedication” specifically, the band sure sounds an like pure E Street. Give it a listen:

…so the reason why I question if this is really a cover:
It’s entirely possible and very probable that what we’re listening to is truly Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band–just with Bonds on vocals instead of Bruce.
In fact–it’s even possible that this is the very same studio recording from those original River Sessions, with Bonds simply recording his vocals over the instrumental track. (If anyone knows for sure, I’d love to know.)
Anyway, let’s check out the song, because it’s pretty darn great and a whole lot of fun. I’m genuinely surprised Bruce doesn’t pull it out from time to time.
This is Bruce in pure pop mode, using historical vignettes in clever comparison to his romantic promises:
*Well way back, baby, in the Bible time*
*A cat named Noah built an ocean liner*
*Everybody laughed when he told them why*
*But when the rain came, Noah, he was high and dry*
*‘Cause he had dedication, baby, through and through*
*Dedication like I give to you*
*Dedication, girl, every way*
*Dedication, girl, every day*
*Well Admiral Byrd and some Eskimos*
*They took a little trip to the old North Pole*
*Well they said it was a miracle when they made it back*
*But he said that wasn’t any miracle, Jack*
*Man, it took dedication baby through and through*
*Dedication like I give to you*
*Dedication, girl, in every way*
*Dedication, girl, every day*
*Well now there was a movie star out in Hollywood*
*He met a little girl, they got along real good*
*He tried to split but the chick she told him, “Not so fast*
*Ain’t gonna wrap me in your arms, then wrap me in some cash”*
*Now it was on TV, every word they said*
*If you didn’t see it, man, you must have been dead*
*She got on the witness stand, sighed without a care*
*She turned to the judge and this is what she said:*
*I gave him dedication, judge, every day*
*Dedication, judge, in every way*
*I need some dedication, judge, that can be spent*
*A little dedication, judge, to pay the rent*
*Dedication baby through and through*
*Dedication like I give to you*
*Dedication, girl, every way*
*Dedication, girl, every day*
They’re not Bruce’s deepest lyrics, but they would have been right at home on *The River* alongside a song like “[Sherry Darling](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/07/06/roll-of-the-dice-sherry-darling/).” (The two songs even share similar “frat rock” introductions.)
“Dedication” would surely be a highlight any time Bruce chooses to play it, but in all these years, he’s only played it once–with Bonds at the Cafe Bar in Long Branch, NJ, in the summer of 1989. No audio is known to exist of it, but here’s a pro-shot recording of Bonds performing it live in 1981:
