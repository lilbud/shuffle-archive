The last time Bruce had a milestone birthday, Philadelphia’s WXPN-FM (shout-out to my all-time favorite radio station) organized an on-air 60th Birthday Bash tribute.
The event featured an array of wonderful artists, but their song choices largely hewed to the usual candidates. There were several “[Streets of Philadelphia](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/06/30/roll-of-the-dice-streets-of-philadelphia/)” covers, a couple versions of “Born to Run,” and of course a few “[I’m on Fire](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/09/11/roll-of-the-dice-im-on-fire/)” renditions.
But singer/songwriter Lizanne Knott went deep that night, turning in a lovely cover of “Stolen Car.”

More wistful than haunted, Lizanne’s arrangement makes for a very different song than Bruce’s original. But isn’t that what a cover should be?
Lizanne finally released her cover of “Stolen Car” years later on her 2016 album, *Excellent Day*.
