Sometimes a wonderful cover can fly completely under the radar.
This is one of them.

Lanny Cordola has associated himself with a few bands over the years, but he’s a wonderful musician in his own right. (He plays every instrument you hear on this track.)
His 2001 spin on “[My Beautiful Reward](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2023/02/19/roll-of-the-dice-my-beautiful-reward/)” is original in sound but true in spirit to the original; it’s more reflective and atmospheric than Bruce’s album version, and his vocals and arrangement really bring out the narrative.
This is very well done.
