When Bruce took the stage in South Africa for the first time ever, we knew we were in for something special right from the beginning.
From the High Hopes Tour [opening show on January 26, 2014](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/01/26/where-the-band-was-cape-town-january-26-2014/), here’s a wonderful pro-shot video of Bruce’s opening number: a cover of “Free Nelson Mandela” by The Special A.K.A.

Never charting in the U.S., “Free Nelson Mandela” reached #9 in the UK in its original 1984 release and was massively popular across Africa. When Mandela passed away in December 2013, the song charted once again, reaching #96–so when Bruce performed it at three South Africa shows in late January 2014, it was very timely.
