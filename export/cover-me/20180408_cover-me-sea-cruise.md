On a wet summer night at Red Rocks in 1981, Bruce playfully covered the Frankie Ford novelty song “Sea Cruise,” complete with bell and horn sound effects.

This was close to a one-off cover–the only other times Bruce performed “Sea Cruise” were at the Naval Academy in Annapolis and in a 1977 guest appearance at the Stone Pony.
Originally written and recorded by Huey Smith, it became a hit when Frankie Ford lifted the instrumental track, recorded his own vocals, and released it in 1959. It went gold and became his biggest hit. Here he is lip-syncing to it on The Dick Clark show that year.
