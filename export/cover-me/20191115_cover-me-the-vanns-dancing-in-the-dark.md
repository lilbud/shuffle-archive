When Bruce resurrected “[Dancing in the Dark](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/12/25/roll-of-the-dice-dancing-in-the-dark/)” on the Rising Tour, he stripped away the eighties synth and gave it a true rock arrangement for the first time.
The Vanns took it a step further–all the way to the garage. Their studio version of Bruce’s greatest hit is gritty, earthy, and hungry.
