For reasons that I don’t have time or even the curiosity to fathom, BBC Radio declared a “1994 Day” last March and invited Man of Many Covers Ryan Adams to help celebrate it. (I’m having trouble coming up with a single enduring musical classic from that year, but I’m sure there are some.)
Ryan chose to perform Bruce’s contemporary Oscar-winner, “[Streets of Philadelphia,](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/06/30/roll-of-the-dice-streets-of-philadelphia/)” and his affecting, intimate performance was captured for prosperity. It’s pretty great.
For the record though, while the single may have been released in early 1994, the song debuted in the movie *Philadelphia* in 1993. So I still maintain that 1994 was kind of a lost year.
