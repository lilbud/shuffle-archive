Although U2 frequently “quotes” Bruce’s songs in concert, they’ve only covered him at length twice (unless you count their handful of performances of “Because the Night” with Patti Smith’s lyrics).
The [first time](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/04/17/cover-me-u2-my-hometown/) was way back in 1985. The last time was 24 years later, at their 2009 concert in Bruce’s backyard of East Rutherford, in honor of Bruce’s 60th birthday. (One might debate whether it’s a snippet or a full cover… it’s kind of in between)
Here’s their live version of Bruce’s “[She’s the One](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/04/04/roll-of-the-dice-shes-the-one/)” (with a bit of “Desire” thrown in–maybe it’s more a mash-up than a cover).
