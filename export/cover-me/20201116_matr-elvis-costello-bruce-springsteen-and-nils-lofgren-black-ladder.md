Only years after the release of Patti Scialfa’s superb third album, *Play It As It Lays*, would the strength, stamina, devotion, and deep abiding love in the album’s final two-minute track snap into focus.
“Black Ladder” is one of Patti’s bravest songs, and one of her most telling.

Anyone surprised by Bruce Springsteen’s revelation in 2016 of a lifelong struggle with depression clearly hadn’t paid much attention to his wife’s lyrics in 2007.
The titular black ladder is a metaphor for the harrowing journey through the depths of a loved one’s depression to find, reach, and connect with them. Patti’s been down that ladder many times.
We all have that ladder, though. Bruce’s may be particularly deep and well-traveled, but at one time or another, we all fall down it. Patti’s no exception, as she reveals in “Black Ladder,” and her song is at heart a pledge of devotion between two partners willing to make the trip down each other’s ladder when needed and guide the other back up.
“Black Ladder” is a beautiful, powerful song, and a perfect capstone for a collection of songs breathtaking in their blend of bravery and vulnerability.
It’s also a an extraordinarily deep cut, even for the most devoted fan.
That’s why it was a shock and surprise when Elvis Costello chose “Black Ladder” for his set list when Bruce made a guest appearance on Elvis’ *Spectacle* series in 2009. Patti wasn’t present, and her album was already two years old by that point, so Elvis’ inclusion was purely an expression of admiration and appreciation.
Accompanied by both Bruce and Nils on guitar (in a superb mix), Elvis took the lead vocal and did Patti proud with an achingly beautiful rendition.

This was the first and only time Bruce has played “Black Ladder” in concert. Even with his own wife, it’s remained unplayed ever since.
