Singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist Phil Beer is no stranger to Bruce Springsteen’s catalog, having played covers of Bruce’s music at least as far back as his Albion Band days a couple of decades ago.
Even today, he’s likely to feature songs like “[Factory](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/10/31/roll-of-the-dice-factory/)” and “[Youngstown](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2023/05/01/roll-of-the-dice-youngstown/)” in his acoustic sets.

His high-water mark, though, is undoubtedly his band’s joyously rollicking cover of “[No Surrender](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/11/18/roll-of-the-dice-no-surrender/)” from his *Mandorock 2000 Live* album.

Beer’s version of “No Surrender” leans heavily on Gareth Turner’s melodeon, infusing Bruce’s song with a zydeco spirit that’s impossible to resist.
Introduced as a one-off cover, “No Surrender” immediately became a fan favorite and has remained a consistent encore number ever since.
