“It’s All Right” is one of Curtis Mayfield’s greatest hits, written and recorded in 1963 during his days fronting The Impressions. It gave the band their first crossover hit, peaking at #4 on the Billboard Hot 100 and the top of the Billboard R&B chart.

Bruce pays homage to Mayfield regularly in his encores when he includes “[People Get Ready](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/11/28/matr-bruce-springsteen-and-jah-love-one-love-people-get-ready/)” in “[Land of Hope and Dreams,](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/01/05/roll-of-the-dice-land-of-hope-and-dreams/)” but for a short time during World Tour 1993, Bruce made “It’s All Right” his final song of the night in a faithful arrangement to the original. It was a sweet, gentle, and communal note to end the show on.
