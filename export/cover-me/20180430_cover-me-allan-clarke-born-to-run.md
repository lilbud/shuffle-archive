Strange but true: Allan Clarke was introduced to Bruce’s music by a music publisher who had been sent some unreleased tracks (presumably by Mike Appel). Clarke immediately requested recording rights for three of the songs, one of which was Bruce’s unreleased recording of “Born to Run.”
Clarke promptly recorded it and planned it for immediate release:
*Well, I was just knocked out with the sound and the energy of ‘Born To Run’. It made me just want to do that track, I just wanted to sing it. So I went in the studio and I recorded it. I was very, very pleased with the outcome. I took it to EMI who said ‘Hey great. Good job.’ They then sat on it. It was ready to be released as a single but they went on strike.* (source: [The Strange Brew, “Allan Clarke – Would You Believe?](http://thestrangebrew.co.uk/allan-clarke-hollies-microsite/would-you-believe/)“)
By the time EMI released Clarke’s version, Bruce’s had already been released, resulting in both songs vying for airplay in 1975.
We know which one won.
