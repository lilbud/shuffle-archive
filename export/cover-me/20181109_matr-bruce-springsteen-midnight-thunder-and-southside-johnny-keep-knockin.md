Some songs get passed down from generation to generation, with one artist inspiring the next.
“Keep A-Knockin” was first recorded by blues artist James Wiggins in 1928…

…which inspired Louis Jordan to cut a smoother take on it in 1939…

…which in turn inspired Louis Jordan fan Little Richard to turn it into an uptempo stomp rocker in 1957.

And it’s Little Richard’s version that undoubtedly inspired Bruce’s only known performances. Bruce took a swing at it three times in the 1980s, all at club performances, and all with other artists.
The first time was at The Stone Pony with Cats on a Smooth Surface in July 1983–but unfortunately no audio of that performance has surfaced. A week later, though, Bruce covered it with Midnight Thunder at The Headline in nearby Neptune, and we are lucky to have *that* recording in soundboard clarity.

Five years later, Bruce took one final (to date) run at “Keep A-Knockin'” — this time with Southside Johnny and The Asbury Jukes at The Stone in San Francisco over Thanksgiving weekend, 1988. It’s a short performance (it segued into “[Little Queenie](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/12/11/cover-me-little-queenie/)“) but a fun one, and you can hear it below.
