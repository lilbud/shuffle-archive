Kaiak is a folk/indie/pop team-up of Swedish musicians Emil Gullhamn and Marcos Ubeda.
Emil and Marcos draw the inspiration for their music from nature, friends, and “really good coffee.”
That description lends itself well to their covers, too, because I can totally dig listening to their version of Bruce’s “[Hungry Heart](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/12/21/roll-of-the-dice-hungry-heart/)” while taking my morning coffee outside on a lazy weekend morning.

That cover track has been around for a few years, but recently the guys teased us with a thirty-second video to go with it.

There’s no indication whether a full-length version is coming, but we can hope. In the meantime, check out more of Kaiak’s music [here](https://www.kaiakmusic.se/).
