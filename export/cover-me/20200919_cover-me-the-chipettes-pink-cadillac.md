Where do we start–with the fact that a children’s novelty record includes one of Bruce’s most sexual songs?
Or maybe the instantly dated Natalie Cole arrangement they used rather than Bruce’s original? (Although to be fair, Cole had more success with it, and at least the Chipettes’ version didn’t have that cheesy video.)
Take your pick. None of that factors into why I’m featuring The Chipettes’ 1988 cover of “[Pink Cadillac](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/08/21/roll-of-the-dice-pink-cadillac/)” here on the Shuffle.
No, I’m sharing it simply because apparently Bruce was okay with this:

…but yet [Bette Midler’s cover of the same song](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/11/26/cover-me-bette-midler-pink-cadillac/) was apparently just too “in your face.”
Go figure.
I guess even Bruce can make a mystifying judgment call once in in a while.
