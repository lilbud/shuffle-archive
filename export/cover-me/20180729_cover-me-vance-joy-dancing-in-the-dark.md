Australian singer-songwriter Vance Joy seems to have a soft spot for Bruce’s greatest hit: he’s covered it frequently, and if you want to hear it, you have several pro-shot video clips and high-quality audio clips to choose from.
This one’s my favorite, from June 7, 2014 in Toronto. Something about his vocals and his expressions perfectly capture the deep-set frustration and isolation at the root of “[Dancing in the Dark.](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/12/25/roll-of-the-dice-dancing-in-the-dark/)”
There’s some beautiful camera work at play here, but Vance’s performance is commanding on its own.
