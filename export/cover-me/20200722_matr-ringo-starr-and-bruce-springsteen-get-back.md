For a musician who was so inspired by The Beatles, Bruce Springsteen’s covers of The Fab Four’s catalog have been relatively few and far between.
“Twist and Shout” is one of Bruce’s encore standards, of course, and he’s made some notable on-stage appearances with Sir Paul McCartney. But beyond those, we’ve got to dig a bit deeper to unearth Bruce’s hidden Beatles gems.
Here’s one of them, from more than three decades ago.
On the evening of August 11, 1989, Ringo Starr brought his All-Starr Band to the Garden State Arts Center in Holmdel, New Jersey.
This was the original incarnation of Ringo’s All-Starr Band, and a true all-star line-up it was: Dr. John was in the band back then, as was Levon Helm and Billy Preston. And since Bruce wasn’t on tour, Ringo seized the opportunity to hire Nils Lofgren and Clarence Clemons, too.
With two E Streeters in the band at a New Jersey show, odds were pretty good that Bruce might make an appearance. But who could have predicted that Bruce would join the band for not one but *five* songs, including two one-time-only Beatles covers?
The first song the truly All-Starr Band tackled was a debut, which is actually surprising: with Billy Preston in the band, we’d expect the set list to include the first Beatles song to credit an additional artist.
“Get Back” was released by The Beatles with Billy Preston in April 1969, and it immediately added another notch to The Beatles already long list of #1 singles–in fact, “Get Back” was the single that tied The Beatles with Elvis for the most #1 singles, each with seventeen.

Still, before Bruce walked on stage that night, Ringo and his band hadn’t ever performed “Get Back” live. Whatever prompted its inclusion that night, it was an inspired choice. Bruce took a lead turn on both vocals and guitar, taking a spotlight moment mid-song for a guitar solo.

For those fortunate enough to have been there, it was a special night, and not just for the historic team-up. No one knew it at the time, but that performance would turn out to be Bruce’s final public performance with members of the E Street Band before they went their separate ways that autumn.
