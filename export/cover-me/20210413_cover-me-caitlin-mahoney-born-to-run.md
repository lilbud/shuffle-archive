New York City-based singer-songwriter Caitlin Mahoney is a big Bruce Springsteen fan.
Like, *seriously* big. If you read or watch any interview with her, Bruce is bound to come up within the the first couple paragraphs.
Think I’m kidding?

Caitlin was exposed to Bruce’s music as an infant and grew up with a love of his music, storytelling, and performances. Bruce’s influence can be felt in her own music and performances–so much so that Caitlin calls Bruce her “spirit animal.”
Catch Caitlin’s live shows, and you’re bound to get a Springsteen cover somewhere in the set, so I had a lot to choose from when deciding on a song to spotlight.
But it turned out to be an easy pick: her cover of “Born to Run” at Rockwood Music Hall from last January is simultaneously celebratory and unintentionally poignant, as it came just weeks before the pandemic of 2020 brought live music to a temporary pause. It’s also a simply great performance.

Hopefully, Caitlin will be back on the road soon and we can catch both her original stories and terrific covers in person. In the meantime, for more of Caitlin’s music, check out her website [here](https://www.youtube.com/user/cmahoneymusictime).
