Jordan Foley and Tyler Hood’s new cover of “[Dancing in the Dark](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/12/25/roll-of-the-dice-dancing-in-the-dark/)” rockets immediately to the top tier of my favorite versions of this very, very, *very* oft-covered song.
Foley is a folk-Americana singer-songwriter based in Orlando, and we can clearly hear those influences in his impressive interpretation.

“Dancing in the Dark” is a dark song at heart, with a theme of restless alienation that connects it to Bruce’s *Nebraska* period that immediately preceded it. Foley and Hood dial right into the spirit of Bruce’s song and bring the narrator to life through Foley’s deeply empathic vocals.
If you’re in the Orlando area, Jordan and Tyler are [on tour now](https://www.jordanfoleymusic.com/tour) (yes, now), so if you’re vaccinated and missing live music, there’s a chance you might even be able to see them perform this terrific cover live.
