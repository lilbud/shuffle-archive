It may not have enjoyed quite the success that its A-side did, but Roy Orbison’s 1961 B-side “Candy Man” still managed to claw its way to #25 on the Billboard Hot 100.

“Candy Man” was tucked onto the flipside of Roy’s smash single, “[Crying](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/05/06/cover-me-crying/),” but audiences found their way to it regardless.

The song was co-written by Beverly Ross, who’d had a previous candy-themed hit with “Lollipop” for The Chordettes, which may or may not have been about oral sex depending on who you ask.

Her follow-up, however, definitely carried a sexual connotation: “It was [co-writer] Fred [Neil’s] idea,” she wrote in her memoir. “He wanted to write a candy song with me since I’d had such success with my hit ‘Lollipop’. He told me that in New Orleans all the prostitutes called their pimps their ‘Candy Man.’ I finally agreed to write the title with him, and it’s still a hit all these years later!”

(Not even five days into the new year, and I’ve already ruined two of your favorite childhood songs. You’re welcome.)

Peaking at #25, “Candy Man” was a relatively minor hit for an iconic singer with nine Top 10 hits to his credit, but it’s nevertheless a great song that stands the test of time.

It’s also a ton of fun to play–something we can tell by watching Roy and the all-star band he assembled for his *Black & White Night* concert in 1987–a band that includes Tom Waits, Elvis Costello (getting a nice harmonica spotlight moment), and k.d. lang, Bonnie Raitt and Jennifer Warnes vamping it up as backing vocalists.

Oh, and Bruce Springsteen of course. Bruce stays in the background on rhythm guitar, but if you keep your eyes open, you’ll spot him several times during the performance having the time of his life.
