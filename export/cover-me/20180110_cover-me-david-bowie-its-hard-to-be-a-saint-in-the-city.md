Two years gone to the day, but his music lives on. Enjoy one of the earliest covers of a Bruce Springsteen song (and a darn good one): David Bowie’s cover of “[It’s Hard to Be a Saint in the City.](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/10/21/roll-of-the-dice-its-hard-to-be-a-saint-in-the-city/)”

Bowie recorded this in 1974, but it languished in the vaults until he released it on his *Sound + Vision* box set in 1989.

([The first](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/01/07/cover-me-david-bowie-growin-up/) was “[Growin’ Up.](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/09/29/roll-of-the-dice-growin-up/)“)
