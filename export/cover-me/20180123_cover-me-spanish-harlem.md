“Spanish Harlem,” originally recorded by Ben E. King in 1960 and written by Jerry Lieber and Phil Spector, covered live by Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band on October 19, 1974 (and only three other times ever).
This is one of my favorite covers, with Bruce’s vocals soaring above Danny’s keyboard, Roy’s piano, and Suki Lahav’s violin.

The original is beautiful as well–one of many Ben E. King songs Bruce would cover over the years.
