Wow.
Just… wow.
I’ve been familiar with Bettye LaVette’s incredibly powerful cover of Bruce’s elegiac “[Streets of Philadelphia](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/06/30/roll-of-the-dice-streets-of-philadelphia/)” since it was released on the outstanding *Song of America* triple CD collection back in 2007. (Thank you, Janet Reno!)
But as I searched for the video to include with this post, I came across a live performance from December 2017, and like I said… wow.

LaVette absolutely *owns* Bruce’s award-winning song, both on stage and in the studio.
The live video is the more powerful of the two, but the studio version benefits from a fuller sound and the addition of a subtle bass:

I honestly don’t know which version I prefer, but both mesmerize me.
These are performances that will stick with you long after you first listen.
