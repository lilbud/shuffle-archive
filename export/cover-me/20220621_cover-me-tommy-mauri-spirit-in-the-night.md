The finalists have been selected for this year’s [*Cover Me* competition](https://www.noiespringsteen.com/contest/), and man oh man are the judges going to have some tough decisions ahead of them!
This year, though, you can vote too. Starting July 1, visit the official contest website to vote for your favorite–but don’t wait until then to start watching and listening, because the finalists’ entries are already posted for your viewing pleasure.
Today’s spotlight is on 22-year-old saxophonist/singer/songwriter Tommy Mauri and his reggae interpretation of Bruce’s “[Spirit in the Night.](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/03/01/roll-of-the-dice-spirit-in-the-night/)”

Tommy’s arrangement is sax-centric (he picked up the saxophone based on Clarence’s inspiration) and bass-bottomed, and it works so amazingly well that one wonders why no one ever tried such an arrangement before.
Tommy is a student at the Giuseppe Verdi Conservatory in Milan, and he performs frequently through Lombardy. Let’s hope we see him at the finals in Bergamo this year and wish him good luck–he’s certainly starting out with a fantastic entry!
