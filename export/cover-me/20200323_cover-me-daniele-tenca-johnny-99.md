Daniele Tenca hails from Italy, but he shouldn’t be a stranger to Springsteen fans–he’s made multiple Light of Day appearances, played The Stone Pony in Asbury Park, and recorded a few outstanding Springsteen covers.
In fact, Tenca recorded an absolutely smoking cover of “[Factory](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/10/31/roll-of-the-dice-factory/)” back in 2010, and I was all set to blog about it later this month.
But a few days ago, this stop-the-presses gem from 2018 showed up on YouTube, and now that “Factory” cover is going to have to wait a while–because I can’t stop listening to Tenca’s absolutely fantastic cover of “[Johnny 99](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/07/20/roll-of-the-dice-johnny-99/).” It’s easily my all-time favorite arrangement of the song, and that includes Bruce’s own.

Tenca actually recorded a live performance of “Johnny 99” back in 2011–you can find on his album *Live for the Working Class.* It’s not nearly as gloriously gritty as the performance above, but it’s still well worth checking out.

When this pandemic ends and I can make it back to Italy again, I’m gonna have to align my trip with one of Tenca’s shows. Until then, I’m just going to keep listening to his albums–[they’re great](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPME3JN_bZBgSMpyjl4VhaA).
