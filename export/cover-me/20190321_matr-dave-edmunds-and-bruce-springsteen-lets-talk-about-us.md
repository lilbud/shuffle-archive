“Let’s Talk About Us” isn’t one of Jerry Lee Lewis’ most well-known songs (released as a single in 1959, it never charted), but it’s certainly one of his most direct.
Even for Lewis, known for his suggestive lyrics, “Let’s Talk About Us” is a remarkably direct song for its time. Jerry Lee plays an impatient suitor telling his girl that he’s waited long enough: it’s sexy time.

It may not make it to a fan’s sign request let alone get selected, but Bruce did cover it once–on stage in 1982 with Dave Edmunds (who charted that year with his cover of “From Small Things (Big Things One Day Come)”) at the short-lived but legendary Big Man’s West in Red Bank.
Here’s that performance (with Bruce playing a supporting role on this one), from September 18, 1982.
