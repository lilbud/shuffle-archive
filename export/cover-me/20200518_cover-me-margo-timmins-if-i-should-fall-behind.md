The Cowboy Junkies are no strangers to covering Bruce’s music in their inimitably sad style. Their stark covers of “[State Trooper](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/12/22/roll-of-the-dice-state-trooper/)” and “Thunder Road” are right up there among the best Springsteen covers out there.
But this one’s different.
Margo Timmins’ solo turn on “[If I Should Fall Behind](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/06/01/roll-of-the-dice-if-i-should-fall-behind/)” is delicate, sweet, and so intimate you can hear the piano pedals.

Featuring Margo on lead vocals, Nick Craine on backgrounds (himself no stranger to Bruce’s music), and Witold Grabowiecki on piano, and Jeff Bird on bass, this darn-near perfect cover stems from Margo’s 2009 under-the-radar *Margo’s Corner* recordings.
It’s one of my favorite performances of one of Bruce’s best songs.
