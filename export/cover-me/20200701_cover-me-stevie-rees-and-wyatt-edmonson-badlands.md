I normally work on a pretty long lead time, but every once in a while I discover a cover that I just can’t bear to put at the back of the queue.
This is one of those times.
Stevie Rees labels his sound as “swampland country,” and that’s a pretty great way to describe his cover of “[Badlands](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/05/20/roll-of-the-dice-badlands/)” with fellow singer-songwriter Wyatt Edmonson.
“Badlands” is the epitome of rock anthems. To re-arrange it as Cajun country is daring enough, but then performing it acoustically? That takes guts. And carrying the melody with a fiddle and mandolin–well, that’s just nuts.
But holy cow… Rees and Edmonson’s cover of “Badlands” doesn’t just rock–it *gallops,* and it’s easily an instant favorite among a sea of Springsteen covers.
Trust me and give this one a watch:
