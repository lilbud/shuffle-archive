There are a *lot* of “Because the Night” covers out there, but this is one of my favorites–and it comes from a most unexpected pairing.
In 2009, The Buena Vista Social Club released their second album in their *Rhythm del Mundo* series, in which they reinvent classic pop and rock songs by teaming up with US, UK, and Irish vocalists and backing them with a Cuban-infused instrumental track–all to raise funds and awareness for climate change and disaster relief.
For “Because the Night,” they chose Scottish singer-songwriter KT Tunstall, and together, Tunstall and the BVSC found a Latin groove that highlights and enhances the sultriness of the lyrics (Patti Smith’s version, I should note) more than even Bruce’s original arrangement.

Who’d have thunk: Jersey + Cuba + Scotland = magic.
