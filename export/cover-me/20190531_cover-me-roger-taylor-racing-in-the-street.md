> “I loved that song, and I used to see Bruce play it live. But for me, it was always too slow, and I just wanted to do it mid-tempo, because it’s such a moving song. I felt that song, for me, should be faster. Bruce always did it so slow, and it was very effective in one way, but I just felt it would be nice if it moved along a bit.” — Roger Taylor, *Goldmine*, February 2015
I’m sure we’ve all thought that “[Racing in the Street](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/10/03/roll-of-the-dice-racing-in-the-street/)” would be more moving if it, well, moved more.
Right?
No?
Well, Roger Taylor did at least, and that’s what led him to record a cover of one of Bruce’s most achingly and beautifully poignant songs on his 1984 solo album, *Strange Frontier–*with a harder, faster spin on it.
Does it work? You decide.
