Everyone knows Manfred Mann’s cover of Bruce’s “[Blinded by the Light](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2023/01/01/roll-of-the-dice-blinded-by-the-light/).” True Springsteen fans know Manfred Mann’s Earth Band [also covered](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/06/14/cover-me-manfred-manns-earth-band-for-you/) “[For You](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/01/08/roll-of-the-dice-for-you/)” and “[Spirit in the Night](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/03/01/roll-of-the-dice-spirit-in-the-night/).”
But the band’s most obscure Springsteen adaptation is actually a cover of Bruce’s greatest hit.
From 2009, check out this brilliant mash-up of “[Dancing in the Dark](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/12/25/roll-of-the-dice-dancing-in-the-dark/)” with “House of the Rising Sun” by The Animals.
