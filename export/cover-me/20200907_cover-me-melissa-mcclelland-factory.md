A Labor Day special today, courtesy of Canadian singer-songwriter Melissa McClelland.
If her name sounds vaguely familiar and her voice sounds *very* familiar, that’s probably because she frequently accompanies Sarah McLachlan on tour, playing the bass guitar and providing powerful backing vocals. If you’ve seen Sarah before, you’ve likely seen Melissa.
Melissa’s solo albums are well worth seeking out, particularly her 2004 sophomore album, *Stranded in Suburbia.* Right at the heart of an album of beautiful original material is a lone cover: Bruce Springsteen’s “[Factory](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/10/31/roll-of-the-dice-factory/).”

Arranged as a crunchy “[Death to My Hometown](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/03/30/roll-of-the-dice-death-to-my-hometown/)“-esque work stomp, Melissa pulls off a tough feat–capturing the song’s original tone while hardening it into a true rocker.
Enjoy the day off if you have it, and send thanks to those who don’t. Our essential workers are what today’s all about.
