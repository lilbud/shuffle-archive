To call The Cash Cows a cover band would be a disservice.
The UK-based duo (and their extra-sized, brass-powered Extreme edition) dramatically reinterpret and reinvent each song they cover, and the most recent addition to the repertoire is Bruce’s “[Dancing in the Dark](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/12/25/roll-of-the-dice-dancing-in-the-dark/).”
Now, I know you’re probably thinking that the world doesn’t need yet another cover of “Dancing in the Dark.”
But does the world need a “Dancing in the Dark” cover propelled by upright bass and trombone while roaming the streets of Nepal?
Yes. Yes, I think we do. Watch and enjoy–I won’t tell if you can’t resist dancing.
