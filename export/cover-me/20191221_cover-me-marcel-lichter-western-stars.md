Bruce Springsteen’s *Western Stars* album gets a lot of deserved attention for its lush arrangements, and the film version only ups the ante with a full-on orchestra.
But as much as I love those arrangements, sometimes all it takes is a simple piano to make you fully appreciate just how gorgeous Bruce’s melodies can be.
Case in point: Marcel Lichter’s solo piano instrumental rendition of the album’s [title track](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/03/28/roll-of-the-dice-western-stars/)–perfect for a quiet weekend morning.
Enjoy.
