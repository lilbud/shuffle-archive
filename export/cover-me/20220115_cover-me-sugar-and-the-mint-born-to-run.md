Okay, sure, we’ve all heard acoustic arrangements of “Born to Run” before.
But a full-band acoustic cover that’s just as joyous and rocking as a full-on electric version? That’s new.
But that’s what Prescott, Arizona-based Sugar and The Mint gives us with their delightful cover of Bruce’s signature song from their 2018 album, *Just Past Midnight*.

With roots in folk and bluegrass and branches in pop, rock, and country, this string quintet covers a remarkable range on their albums and on stage, and their joy and love for the source material is palpable.
Just watch their live performance from a few years ago and try not to smile. Oh and in case you’ve ever wondered whether that iconic sax solo would work just as perfectly on the violin:
Why, yes. Yes, it does.
