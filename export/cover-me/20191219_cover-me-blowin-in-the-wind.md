Every musician has a list of songs they didn’t write but wished they had. I have to believe that Bob Dylan’s “Blowin’ in the Wind” is high on Bruce Springsteen’s list.

“Blowin’ in the Wind” is exactly the kind of song Bruce writes when he’s at his folky best, with lyrics that are both unmistakably explicit and ambiguously elusive. The song poses questions for which the answers are intuitively obvious but intellectually impossible to answer, and by doing so Dylan captures the frustration of a society striving to follow their better angels but finding it increasingly difficult to do.

The song’s layered, deceptive simplicity makes it instantly memorable, and its message ensures its immortality. That’s probably why *Rolling Stone* not only includes “Blowin’ in the Wind” on its 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list, they rank it near the very top at #14.

So it’s surprising to learn that Bruce has only covered Dylan’s classic twice–and only one of them was probably his idea.

**First performed:**’s first time covering “Blowin’ in the Wind’ was a high-visibility occasion: he performed it solo and acoustic at the televised S.O.S. Racisme Concert in Paris in the spring of 1988. Bruce was arguably at a peak of his political involvement at the time (he would very shortly announce is involvement in Amnesty International’s Human Rights Now Tour), and his performance is powerful and passionate.

Bruce performed “Blowin’ in the Wind” once more, just a few months later on the aforementioned Human Rights Now Tour. This time, though, he was a guest artist during Joan Baez’s set, and to my knowledge there’s no circulating recording of their duet.

First performed:** June 18, 1988 (Paris, France)
