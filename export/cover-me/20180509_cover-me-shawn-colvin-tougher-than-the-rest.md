In 2015, Shawn Colvin released an her *Uncovered* album, and it opens with a very much covered song: Bruce Springsteen’s “[Tougher Than the Rest](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/08/08/roll-of-the-dice-tougher-than-the-rest/).”
It’s a gorgeous performance that captures the soul of the song. As she said in an [NPR interview](https://www.npr.org/2015/09/26/442917037/we-all-have-something-to-say-shawn-colvin-on-the-value-of-cover-songs):
*It’s mistaken, perhaps, for a song that’s got a lot of bravado in it, and I don’t see it that way. I see it as world-weariness that he’s conveying, and sort of a quiet confidence, born of struggle and experience and heartbreak.*
