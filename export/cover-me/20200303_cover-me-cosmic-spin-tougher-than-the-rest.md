I’m digging Cosmic Spin at the moment. Their *Gilding Lillies* EP is well worth seeking out for their gorgeous harmonies, deep grooves, and fantastic cover arrangements of Fleetwood Mac, Neil Young, and other great artists.
If you’re a fan of early Everything But the Girl, you’ll love Cosmic Spin.
In fact, the duo’s latest single (released just a few days ago as of this writing) is [a Springsteen song that Everything But the Girl covered](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/09/19/cover-me-everything-but-the-girl-tougher-than-the-rest/) on their *Acoustic* album back in 1992.
EBTG’s version used to be my favorite of the “[Tougher Than the Rest](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/08/08/roll-of-the-dice-tougher-than-the-rest/)” covers, but I think it’s just been supplanted. Listen and enjoy.
