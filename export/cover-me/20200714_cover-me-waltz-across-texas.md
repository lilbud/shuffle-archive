Even though we know Bruce has covered countless songs across a spectrum of styles, most of us still wouldn’t expect Ernest Tubb’s “Waltz Across Texas” to be on that list.

“Waltz Across Texas” was something of a local favorite and one of Tubb’s most well-known and most-requested songs, even though it never rose higher than #34 when Tubb released it in 1965 and disappeared from the charts entirely after seven weeks.
In that era when music was still regional, that was probably too short a time for Bruce to have noticed “Waltz Across Texas” during its original release. But when Bruce brought the E Street Band to Austin during the River Tour, someone slipped him one of Tubb’s albums backstage, and Bruce listened to it.
He must have been taken with “Waltz Across Texas,” because during the encores that night, he debuted his first and only cover of it as the night’s penultimate song.

Bruce’s arrangement was traditional, and his vocals warm and wonderful. The E Street Band played with respectful restraint, and Clarence’s sax solo was a natural fit.
It was a serendipitous one-off, and we’re fortunate that it was captured on tape.
