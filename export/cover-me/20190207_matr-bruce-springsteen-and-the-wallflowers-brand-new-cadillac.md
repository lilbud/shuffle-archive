“Brand New Cadillac” was one of the first British rock and roll singles, first released in 1959 by Vince Taylor (as a B-side, actually).

Twenty years later, The Clash covered it and released it on *London Calling,* giving the original rockabilly arrangement a harder punk edge.

And then almost *another* twenty years on, Bruce Springsteen and The Wallflowers put their own spin on it when Bruce joined the band on stage at their gig at Tradewinds in Sea Bright, New Jersey.
For a man almost a year-and-a-half into a solo acoustic tour, Bruce seriously rocks it–it sounds like he’s having a blast.
From March 8, 1997, take a listen to Bruce and The Wallflowers tear it up on “Brand New Cadillac.”
