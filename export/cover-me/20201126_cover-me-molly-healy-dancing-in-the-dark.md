Molly Healey is a multi-talented looping violinist, cellist, and guitarist, and she puts two of those talents (along with a terrific voice) to use on her cover of Bruce Springsteen’s “[Dancing in the Dark](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/12/25/roll-of-the-dice-dancing-in-the-dark/).”
I know that “Dancing in the Dark” covers are a dime a dozen these days, but trust me: you haven’t seen or heard one like Molly’s before.
Make sure you watch all the way through–the final three minutes are a stunning example of what Molly calls “rock-inspired orchestral looping.”
