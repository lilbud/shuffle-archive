Wow.
There’s an absolute flood of Springsteen covers being released by artists during the global shutdown, and while I try to watch them all, it’s tough to find the time or the quiet to pay full attention.
But when I came across this cover of “[The Ghost of Tom Joad](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/10/17/roll-of-the-dice-the-ghost-of-tom-joad/)” by French singer-songwriter Jericho with Seb Martel on lap steel, I found myself unable to look away.
This may be the single most impassioned performance (in acoustic form, at least) I’ve ever heard of Bruce’s oft-covered song.

Jericho’s cover is intended to raise awareness for relief efforts in Montreuil, a Parisian suburb. There’s no link in the video for donations, though, just instructions for locals who want to help.
So if you’re moved by his outstanding cover and want to help but aren’t local, perhaps find an organization working to help struggling families in our own communities.
Stay healthy, and stay safe.
