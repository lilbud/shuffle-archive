Several weeks back, we took a look at “[Boom Boom](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/03/26/cover-me-boom-boom/),” the smoking hot John Lee Hooker song that worked its way into Bruce’s set list right around the time he and Patti became a secret item–timing that was probably not coincidental.
But only a few days before, it seemed like Bruce might be on the verge of choosing a different classic Hooker song to add to his set–one that was equally sexy (arguably moreso).
During his Tunnel of Love Express Tour soundcheck in Tacoma on May 6, 1988, Bruce pulled out Hooker’s steamy 1956 crossover hit, “Dimples.”

Was Bruce in a John Lee Hooker mood in the spring of 1988, or was he just feeling his oats? Regardless, his cover, although recorded from a distance, is brassy and cool (once it gets going). It may not switch and sashay like Hooker’s original, but it’s a great arrangement that would have fit nicely in Bruce’s opening set.

Just four days later, though, Bruce would debut cover of “Boom Boom” in Bloomington, Minnesota, and “Dimples” would never be heard from again.
