Today’s cover is definitely on the obscure side–unless, perhaps, you live in Germany, where Helen Schneider was a popular recording artist in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
Schneider may live and work in Germany, but she’s got New Jersey bonafides: she grew up in North Jersey, and her only American cinema credit was a memorable one–she played Joann Carlino in the classic *Eddie and the Cruisers,* which is pretty much a feature-length love note to the Jersey shore sound. (Never saw it? Go find it, and thank me later.)
And then there’s her cover of Bruce’s “[Hearts of Stone](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/09/07/roll-of-the-dice-hearts-of-stone/).” It’s not the most interesting of videos to watch (it was 1980, after all, still pre-MTV), but she certainly commits to the song.
