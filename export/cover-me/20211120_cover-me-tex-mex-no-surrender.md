I don’t know why so many of my favorite Springsteen covers originate in Italy, but they do.
Like this one, for instance.
Guitarist, bassist and lead singer Frank Get is a familiar face to Light of Day attendees–he’s played the annual benefit on a few occasions, including this past year’s virtual event.
In 2009, Get founded a blues combo called Tex Mex, and in 2013, the band released an album of original songs called *The Best Has Yet to Come.* Tucked away at the end of the disc was a single cover song–a gorgeous and tender arrangement of Bruce Springsteen’s “[No Surrender.](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/11/18/roll-of-the-dice-no-surrender/)” It’s a song that’s been on my mind a lot this week, and Get’s version dials up the nostalgia and the sentiment without losing its fierce resolve.

Tex Mex isn’t around anymore, but Frank certainly is. With any luck, we’ll see him at Light of Day again soon.
