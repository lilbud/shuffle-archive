Barney Bentall may not be a familiar name outside of his native Canada, but he’s certainly well-known there.
His debut 1988 album with The Legendary Hearts went platinum, and its very first track, “Something to Live For” became a number one hit–and it’s easy to hear the Springsteenian influences from the outset.

More than thirty years later, Bentall is still recording and performing across Canada, both solo and as part of four different bands–one of which, the Cariboo Express, is (in Bentall’s words) a travelling, fundraising old-time musical revue.
At one of the revue’s recent shows in St. Albert, Bentall chose to cover a brand new Springsteen song, and his choice revealed a deep appreciation and respect for Bruce’s music.
Their cover of “[Moonlight Motel](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/09/30/roll-of-the-dice-moonlight-motel/)” is perfect–delicate, intimate, and nuanced like the original, making full use of the band’s violinist and pedal steel guitarist.
No wonder the audience is rapt from the start. Take a listen:

There might be a road trip up I-5 to Vancouver in my future when the Express comes around again…
