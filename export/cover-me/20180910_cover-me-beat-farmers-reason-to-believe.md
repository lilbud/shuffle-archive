If you’re a fan of the rock arrangement of “[Reason to Believe](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/02/27/roll-of-the-dice-reason-to-believe/)” that Bruce debuted during the Magic Tour, give a listen to The Beat Farmers’ cover treatment from way back in 1985–it rocks just as hard.

“Reason to Believe” featured prominently on The Beat Farmers’ first album, *Tales of the New West*, and it was a frequent highlight of their live shows as well.

It was their novelty song “Happy Boy” that was the breakout song from their first album, and that’s unfortunate because their proper blend and brand of west coast country punk never got the the airplay it deserved. Their cover of “Reason to Believe” successfully electrified one of the stubborn *Nebraska* songs that Bruce could never quite wire up back in the early eighties.
