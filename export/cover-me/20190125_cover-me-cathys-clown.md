When the Everly Brothers released “Cathy’s Clown” in 1960, it quickly went to #1 in both the U.S. (for five weeks) and U.K. (for seven). Billboard ended up ranking it at #3 for the entire year, and it would prove to be the Everlys most successful single ever and their final #1 hit.

It’s not a love song, or even a happy song; it’s a song about being dumped and wounded pride. That might seem like a strange candidate for a number one song, but since it’s an experience most of us have had, perhaps it resonated strongly.
It certainly was a good thematic fit for Bruce’s setlist on the Tunnel of Love Express Tour, which is probably why he was caught soundchecking it one spring afternoon in Tacoma.
Bruce never did play it that night–or *any* night ever–but we can eavesdrop on that 1988 soundcheck and hear how Bruce might have approached and arranged it if he did.
