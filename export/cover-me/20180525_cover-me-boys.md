During sign collection in Kansas City, at the final show on the Magic Tour, Bruce collected a sign from a Max Weinberg fan that simply said, “Let Max Sing.”
Laughing, Bruce honored the request and let Max pick the song. Max picked one of his favorites: “Boys.” The result: a short, ragged but fun performance of The Beatles’ classic.
You might have heard this one-time-only performance of Max Weinberg and the E Street Band on the show’s official archive release, but you might not have *seen* it. So here it is, with Max in full glory:

Want to compare with the original? You’ll have to look further back than The Beatles: “Boys” was originally recorded and performed by “The Shirelles” in 1960.
