Jimmy Forrest recorded “Night Train” in 1952 as a sultry, earthy R&B instrumental.

But when Bruce pulled it out of his hat during his Darkness Tour show in Atlanta, “Night Train” rocked as it hurtled down the tracks.

**Night Train** the impromptu, accelerated “Night Train” performance?

When Bruce and the band started their second set that night with “[Santa Claus Is Comin’ to Town](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/12/24/cover-me-santa-claus-is-comin-to-town/),” the fake snowfall went a bit overboard, and a clean-up crew had to come out to mop up the stage.

To kill time while the crew did their work, Bruce led the band through “Night Train” in a one-time-only performance.

It’s never been heard from since.

**Night Train
**First performed:** September 30, 1978 (Atlanta, GA)
