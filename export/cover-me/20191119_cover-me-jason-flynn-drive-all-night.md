**Update 12/17/2020:** Mysteriously, all traces of Jason Flynn seem to have been scrubbed from the Internet–web site, social media, videos… strange. I hope he’s okay. I did find one stray copy of his wonderful “Drive All Night” cover however–it’s not as great as the earlier clips I featured here, but it’s worth watching nonetheless.

I have a soft spot for buskers, especially those who appreciate the music of Bruce Springsteen.
So while I don’t know anything about this particular street musician to provide as background, I nevertheless encourage you to take six minutes out of your day to enjoy Jason Flynn’s beautiful cover of Bruce’s timeless love song, “[Drive All Night](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/02/27/roll-of-the-dice-drive-all-night/).”
Flynn’s rendition is more tender than Bruce’s original. If Bruce’s version is a powerful declaration of the lengths he’d go to for his girl, Flynn’s version is a quiet but confident pledge of devotion. It’s simply a beautiful performance.
