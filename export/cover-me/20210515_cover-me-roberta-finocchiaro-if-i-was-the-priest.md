If you’re a Springsteen fan, have musical talent, and think you can bring a fresh perspective to one of Bruce’s songs, there’s still time to enter the s[econd annual Cover Me contest!](https://www.noiespringsteen.com/contest/)
Last June, I featured the Critics’ Prize winner from the first edition here on the Shuffle: Light of Day alum Roberta Finnochiaro and her [wonderful cover](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/06/07/cover-me-roberta-finocchiaro-new-york-city-serenade/) of “New York City Serenade.”

Roberta’s back for this year’s contest, and her entry is just as deep a cut as her first one: “[If I Was the Priest](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/12/28/roll-of-the-dice-if-i-was-the-priest/),” one of Bruce’s oldest or newest songs, depending on your perspective.
Roberta has a terrific voice, but as with her cover of “New York City Serenade,” the highlight of her rendition of “If I Was the Priest” is her guitar playing. She’s arranged the song for a solo electric performance, and the last funky minute in particular is bound to get you grooving.

Will Roberta stage a repeat win this year? With entries still rolling in, it’s too soon to handicap. Stay tuned this summer for more great contestants and my coverage of the finals.
(Interested in participating? Check out the contest site for [rules and regulations](https://www.noiespringsteen.com/contest/#box-regolamento), and get your entry in by May 31, 2021. Hopefully, I’ll see you at the finals in Bergamo, Italy this summer!)
