I don’t even know what to say about Half Japanese’s cover of “[Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/11/19/roll-of-the-dice-tenth-avenue-freeze-out/)” other than: if you already know their style, you already know what to expect.
And if you don’t, just know that they’ve been around about as long as Bruce has and that they have a rather laissez faire (at best) attitude toward things like, say, melody and chords. Also tuning. Sometimes even stringing. And they have a cult following for precisely those reasons, along with a fervor and a passion for rock and roll that rivals Bruce’s even if on a completely different vector.
So, yeah. That’s pretty much what you need to know. Go ahead now and listen to “Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out” from the band’s 1980 studio album, *Half Gentlemen/Not Beasts*. You’ll know within 20 seconds whether you want to listen all the way through.
