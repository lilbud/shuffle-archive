“[Stand On It](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/10/08/roll-of-the-dice-stand-on-it/)” is not an easy song to cover–it’s as rockabilly as rockabilly gets, and rockabilly is a lost art form these days. But there are a few bands out there keeping rockabilly alive, and one of them hails from Pottsville, just an hour’s drive from Asbury Park.
The Razorbacks released their live album, *Home of the Razorbacks*, way back in 2001, and they opened both their set and the CD with their deservedly confident cover of “Stand On It.”

The Razorbacks are still touring (or at least they were, pre-COVID), so keep an eye out when the dust clears–you might be able to catch this one live.
