If I keep stumbling across [brilliant](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/01/16/cover-me-13th-alibi-and-dilia-cover-me/) [covers](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/05/07/cover-me-the-album-show-cover-me/) of “[Cover Me](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/01/13/roll-of-the-dice-cover-me/),” I may just have to re-evaluate my opinion of my least favorite Springsteen song.
Because this cool but sultry rooftop performance by The Wallys is wonderful in every respect, from Valeria Colombo’s commanding vocals and charismatic presence to Adriano Cuccinella’s upright bass that keeps the song bouncing along.

I wish I could tell you more about this Italian band, but I’ve been unable to suss out any sort of online presence, other than for the video’s director (Roberto Mazzarelli).
But this is a band I’d certainly like to see and hear more from.
