But its popularity is widely attributed to Pete Seeger, who adopted and shaped it in the 1950s, and to Guy Carawan, who shares a copyright with Seeger and who introduced it to the Civil Rights movement and the SNCC in 1960.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Pete Seeger, We Shall Overcome (Version #02), Berlin, DDR (GDR), 1967\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/M_Ld8JGv56E?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a great interview with Pete Seeger a few years before his death, where he discusses the song&#8217;s origins:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Civil Rights History Project: Pete Seeger\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wVML_U6W9dc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Almost immediately, &#8220;We Shall Overcome&#8221; became an anthem of social justice and resistance, spreading first through the Civil Rights movement and then worldwide. It&#8217;s been recorded and performed by Joan Baez, Mahalia Jackson, and so many others&#8211;including, of course, Bruce Springsteen.</p>\n<p>Bruce&#8217;s version dates back not to his 2006 album of the same name, as many people believe, but to almost a decade prior. In 1997, Bruce was contacted by the Appleseed record label with a request to contribute a track for an upcoming Pete Seeger tribute compilation called\u00a0<em>Where Have All the Flowers Gone: The Songs of Pete Seeger.</em> Bruce accepted and chose &#8220;We Shall Overcome&#8221; as his contribution, recording the song in his home studio with Patti, Soozie, and a collection of musician friends and friends of friends.</p>\n<p>The tribute album was released in 1998, and Bruce&#8217;s &#8220;We Shall Overcome&#8221; leads off Disc 2. If you listen to it below, you&#8217;ll notice that it&#8217;s a different mix than the one Bruce would release on his own eight years later, but it&#8217;s also clearly the same recording.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - &quot;We Shall Overcome&quot; (original 1998 version)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/026oa4oMG5k?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>In the aftermath of September 11, Bruce&#8217;s version of &#8220;We Shall Overcome&#8221; made frequent appearance on TV news and documentary specials, and along with &#8220;My City of Ruins&#8221; helped shore up strength and resilience among frightened citizens.</p>\n<p>Eight years after that original home recording session, Bruce revisited &#8220;We Shall Overcome&#8221; and the five other songs recorded back in 1997, and he supplemented them with nine new recordings using the same musicians. A third and final recording session in early 2006 completed the collection that would yield <em>We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions </em>and inspire one of Bruce&#8217;s shortest, under-attended and joyous tours ever.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the album version of &#8220;We Shall Overcome.&#8221; If you listen with sharp ears, you&#8217;ll hear the differences in the mix from the original version.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"We Shall Overcome\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ULYpA_Z4yx8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Throughout the Seeger Sessions tour, &#8220;We Shall Overcome&#8221; was a nightly highlight.
