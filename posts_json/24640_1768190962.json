But that&#8217;s not a settled matter, and such debates are beyond the scope of this blog.</p>\n<p>In any event, it seems clear that Bruce cared little for the political context of &#8220;Froggie Went A-Courtin&#8221; when he recorded it. It&#8217;s a familiar song (thanks to memorable recordings by Pete Seeger, Woody Guthrie, Burl Ives, Bob Dylan, and a host of others), a fun ensemble piece, and an upbeat way to close the album.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Froggie Went a Courtin&#039;\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EhgPXkWUO-s?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>There have been so many versions of &#8220;Froggie Went A-Courtin'&#8221; over the years, in fact, that over 170 verses have been collected and catalogued.</p>\n<p>Bruce seems to have taken his cue from Pete Seeger&#8217;s version (no surprise, given the inspiration for the project); although Bruce omits several of Seeger&#8217;s verses, Pete&#8217;s seems to be the first recording to include the final &#8220;cornbread&#8221; verse that also appears in Bruce&#8217;s version.</p>\n<p>How much fun is &#8220;Froggie Went A-Courtin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>\n<p>So much that Elvis Presley had a blast goofing to it at an improv studio rehearsal session.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Elvis Presley-Froggy went a courtin\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kKtKbROMp-A?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>And so much fun that Bruce couldn&#8217;t resist singing along with himself when he heard the playback.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Froggie Went a Courtin&#039; (The Seeger Sessions)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rcoA9Tvgghs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>So why didn&#8217;t Bruce play it more often during the Seeger Sessions Tour?
