The E Street Band went on hiatus after that tour; they wouldn&#8217;t tour again for more than a decade.</p>\n<p>But that tour was notable for more than its closure of a chapter of E Street history&#8211;it also marked the birth of a friendship that has stood the test of time ever since.</p>\n<p>Although the six-week tour featured a top-notch array of headlining talent that included Peter Gabriel, Tracey Chapman, and Youssou N&#8217;Dour, it was Sting who Bruce grew close with over the course of the tour.</p>\n<p>Their on-stage chemistry and obvious love for each other&#8217;s music was evident from the start, and it didn&#8217;t take long for Bruce to invite Sting to join him during his set for a duet on &#8220;The River.&#8221; Two weeks, later, Sting returned the compliment by inviting Bruce to join him for his set-closing &#8220;Every Breath You Take,&#8221; and their reciprocal guest appearances instantly became a nightly highlight.</p>\n<p>By that time, of course, &#8220;Every Breath You Take&#8221; was already a classic. Even though the song was only five years old in 1988, it wasn&#8217;t just a number one song the year it came out, it was\u00a0<em>the\u00a0</em>number one song for the entire year, riding the top of the charts in the U.S. for a full eight weeks. Heck, it was the fifth-highest selling single for the entire\u00a0<em>decade</em>.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"758\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OMOGaugKpzs?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></div>\n<p>So by 1988, with The Police in his rear-view mirror, it was no wonder that Sting clung to their signature song and made it his nightly closer.</p>\n<p>The tour finale was in Buenos Aires, and it was filmed for television broadcast. In the clip below, we can see just how comfortable they&#8217;d become in each other&#8217;s presence and how much joy they took in playing together. Check it out, and just try to keep from smiling.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"758\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6GYt6mzQ3Xo?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></div>\n<p>(I love the moment at about the one minute mark where Sting does his best Bruce impression!)</p>\n<p>Bruce and Sting have remained close friends, and they&#8217;ve performed with or for each other several times over the decades since.
