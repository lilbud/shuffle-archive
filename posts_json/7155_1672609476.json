I imagine Bruce was pretty intrigued by Burke&#8217;s song choice as well.</p>\n<p>But I&#8217;m not sure that Bruce anticipated where Burke was going to take his song. Not only did Burke completely transform Bruce&#8217;s original with an infectious country roots arrangement (featuring Garry Tallent on bass&#8211;who ironically did not play on the original version), he put his own lyrical stamp on it as well.</p>\n<p>For most of the song, the lyric changes are stylistic, better suited to his increasingly over-the-top vocal performance. But after the bridge&#8230; well, you&#8217;ll need to listen for yourself:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Ain&#039; got you\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zHIT2xZ0Upw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Well, now. &#8220;Smoke my cigar,&#8221; indeed.</p>\n<p>What was once a sweet, rueful love song by a rock star who realized that all the money and fame in the world can&#8217;t buy love is now a spiteful celebration of sex and excess without consequences. In Burke&#8217;s version, the singer\u00a0<em>celebrates</em> the fact that he ain&#8217;t got the girl, and by the end of the song (&#8220;what are you doing with my checkbook?&#8221;), Burke has not only taken Bruce&#8217;s song off the rails, he&#8217;s sent it over a cliff.</p>\n<p>But like I always say: if you&#8217;re gonna cover Bruce, be different or be great.</p>\n<p>This one is\u00a0<em>definitely</em> different.</p>\n<p>As for great&#8230; you tell me.
