(If he only knew what was coming.)</p>\n<p>Fun fact #2: Alejandro Escovedo was Jesse&#8217;s co-writer, so the Bruce connections in this song run deep.</p>\n<p>With a catchy two-chord riff, an awesomely gonzo video, and a theme that Jesse calls &#8220;P.M.A.&#8221; (Positive Mental Attitude), &#8220;Meet Me at the End of the World&#8221; is irresistible. Seriously, go ahead: try to resist it.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"758\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0BQfwgiYkjo?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></div>\n<p>But of course, the world got progressively end-ier after 2017, so two years later Jesse recut the song as &#8220;Meet Me at the End of the World Again&#8221; for his excellent 2019 album,\u00a0<em>Sunset Kids</em>.</p>\n<p>This time, Jesse and his trusty road manager Bob Strauss (Jesse never goes <em>anywhere</em> without him) took their crew to the west coast to recreate the video.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"758\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tWWQThdoYP8?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></div>\n<p>&#8220;Meet Me at the End of the World&#8221; is one of Jesse&#8217;s most infectious songs, and with it now committed to disc into two versions, it was pretty much a lock for Jesse&#8217;s set at Light of Day last year.</p>\n<p>What\u00a0<em>wasn&#8217;t</em> a lock was seeing him perform it with Bruce.</p>\n<p>Bruce took the stage for the first time that night to join Jesse on their 2007 duet, &#8220;Broken Radio,&#8221; surprising the audience only with his appearance, not with their song choice.</p>\n<p>But Bruce stayed on stage for one more song after &#8220;Broken Radio,&#8221; treating the audience to his first and only performance to date of &#8220;Meet Me at the End of the World.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"758\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kz3BUGV15fY?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></div>\n<p>Bruce and Jesse gave a great performance, keeping fans on their feet and dancing for the entire song.</p>\n<p>I can personally attest to that, too, thanks to my vantage point that night.
