Even then, Bruce had a flair for the dramatic&#8211;the moment when the band enters is undeniably powerful. Take a listen:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Steel Mill - The War Is Over (Live At The Matrix 1970)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VEaRsvkobrk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>That was, in fact, the band&#8217;s opening number that night, and it must have been quite an introduction. Although the lyrics pale in comparison even to much of his contemporaneous compositions, Bruce&#8217;s musical craftsmanship is on full display. Notice how he uses a recorder to set the scene in a medieval king&#8217;s court (I&#8217;d love to know who&#8217;s playing it)? That&#8217;s a stroke of genius.</p>\n<p>Honestly, the most interesting thing about the lyrics is their timeliness today. Originally written during the Vietnam war to protest the deadly, disastrous conflict, the references to a king entertained by low culture while a resistance builds, betrayed by a steady stream of deserters, isolated and aggrieved, and beset on all sides by those who would remove him from power&#8230; well, let&#8217;s just say the lyrics require a lot less poetic license today than they did fifty years ago.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>The king and the queen have drowned in their laughter</em><br />\n<em>Today the new court jester has arrived</em><br />\n<em>And he&#8217;ll tell you funny stories and dance a bit after</em><br />\n<em>And help the king forget the revolution outside</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well the wars been lost can your army stay and watch</em><br />\n<em>As thousands desert to the other side</em><br />\n<em>Your people pledge allegiance in the face of a bomb</em><br />\n<em>And too many people have died telling other jokes</em><br />\n<em>The king, he cried</em></p>\n<p>So far, so good, in either decade. Suddenly, though, Bruce rips the metaphor away like a band-aid, and we feel as if we&#8217;re dropped onto a battlefield, the screaming children all around us:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well when are you gonna realize that your kingdom is crumbling before your eyes</em><br />\n<em>Your tears have been streaming like blood from the sky</em><br />\n<em>When you hear the children screaming whose brothers have died</em><br />\n<em>You can murder in the name of freedom but you just can&#8217;t hide</em></p>\n<p>By the time Bruce picks the story back up (after an extended power jam), we&#8217;re shell-shocked. We&#8217;ve all but forgotten the original setting. Luckily, the band reminds us that we&#8217;re back in the king&#8217;s court, but the whiplash from the stark bridge back to the verses&#8217; metaphor doesn&#8217;t work nearly as well in reverse as it did at the beginning.</p>\n<p>I can certainly see what he was aiming for: Bruce deliberately decorated the verses in order to make the plain-spoken bridge more powerful in contrast. But in the second half of the song, Bruce takes the metaphor a bit too far, sticking his toe over the line between novel and trite a few times:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>The moon is hanging high over the castle tonight</em><br />\n<em>There&#8217;s rumors of an attempt on the throne</em><br />\n<em>The king has locked himself into his chamber</em><br />\n<em>And the walls are screaming out &#8220;You&#8217;re alone, you fool, you&#8217;re alone&#8221;</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>And from the cave of night rides a horseman</em><br />\n<em>And he comes bringing word of the war</em><br />\n<em>He says &#8220;sire, your armies are defeated</em><br />\n<em>No people are fighting anymore, for your kingdom it ain&#8217;t yours</em><br />\n<em>And they killed your last soldier&#8221;</em><br />\n<em>And the war is over</em></p>\n<p>By the end of the song, we&#8217;ve truly entered the realm of a fairy tale, with a comeuppance for the ruler that&#8217;s so neat and tidy, only a nineteen-year-old could write it.</p>\n<p>So yeah, this isn&#8217;t Bruce at his best&#8211;it&#8217;s not even Bruce at his teenage best. Like I said at the top, he&#8217;d get much better at exploring this theme with age, relying on empathy and subtlety rather than preachiness to make his point. But there&#8217;s still much to admire here, from the imaginative use of the recorder to the deliberate song construction to lyrics that resonate in ways Bruce couldn&#8217;t have possibly imagined when he wrote them.</p>\n<p>And the next time you hear someone complain about Bruce getting political in his later years, point them to &#8220;The War Is Over.&#8221; His values were on full display a full half-century ago.</p>\n<p><strong>The War Is Over</strong><br />\n<strong>Never recorded<br />\nNever released</strong><br />\n<strong>First performed:</strong> September 20, 1969 (Richmond, VA)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> August 14, 1970 (Richmond, VA)</p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
