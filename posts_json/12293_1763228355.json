It&#8217;s also a musical history lesson dating back to the early days of the blues era.</p>\n<p>Got that?</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the backstory:</p>\n<p>&#8220;Devil With a Blue Dress&#8221; was first recorded in 1964 by Shorty Long, who wrote the song with Mickey Stevenson. If you&#8217;re not familiar with Long&#8217;s version, you might be startled by how different his original blues stomp arrangement is from the version Bruce performs. (I actually prefer the original version, especially that tasty guitar solo.)</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Shorty Long - Devil With The Blue Dress\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jaZ3pxgvfhY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Two years later, Mitch Ryder and The Detroit Wheels took a run at it with a\u00a0<em>much\u00a0</em>more uptempo version, and right smack in the middle, the band takes a right turn and launches into a cover of Little Richard&#8217;s &#8220;Good Golly, Miss Molly.&#8221; The result: a #4 smash hit for Ryder, matching the peak chart performance of Little Richard&#8217;s own &#8220;Good Golly, Miss Molly.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels-Devil in a Blue Dress\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KVbr37_yPeY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>But if the shift from &#8220;Devil&#8221; to &#8220;Miss Molly&#8221; was electrifying, the shift back near the end of the song is just awkward.</p>\n<p>So when Bruce decided to cover Ryder&#8217;s Devil/Molly mash-up, he solved that problem by appending yet another Ryder medley: his earlier Top 10 hit from 1965, &#8220;Jenny Take a Ride.&#8221;</p>\n<p>With Jenny, however, we need to take a ride <em>much</em> further back in time, because Jenny started life as Johnny.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Johnny Moore&#039;s Three Blazers with Mari Jones - Johnny Johnny\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jum4Qa5bUJI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;Johnny Johnny&#8221; was a 1952 single by Johnny Moore&#8217;s Three Blazers, one of their last.
