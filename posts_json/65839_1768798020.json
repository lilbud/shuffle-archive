Ditching the earlier song&#8217;s rockabilly backing track and swapping in a slower, folky, pensive accompaniment makes a world of difference.</p>\n<p>As does adding a verse:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>There&#8217;s a highway over yonder lit by a moon pale and cold</em><br />\n<em>Where together we would wander before our love grew old</em><br />\n<em>There were roadside stands and a hundred faces we would never know</em><br />\n<em>But we held tight to each other and you said, &#8220;John, I love you so&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>That&#8217;s lovely imagery and a wistful romanticization of a life and love that could have been. And that last line is especially powerful once we realize how the song ends.</p>\n<p>Even the bridge is an improvement, tightening and tautening the narrator&#8217;s insomnia to the point where we can feel his frustration.</p>\n<p>But the ending&#8230; remember I wrote that &#8220;Black Mountain Ballad&#8221; improves on\u00a0<em>almost\u00a0</em>every aspect of &#8220;Don&#8217;t Back Down on Our Love.&#8221; Here&#8217;s the reason for the caveat.</p>\n<p>In the earlier track, our narrator&#8217;s last words are haunted and grieving as he wakes in darkness:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Last night I stood on Black Mountain and looked out to the sea</em><br />\n<em>Where the waters of Mystery River go rushing endlessly</em><br />\n<em>And the love we swore would last as long as those waters roared on</em><br />\n<em>I awoke in the darkness, it was gone, gone, gone</em></p>\n<p>Inexplicably, in &#8220;Black Mountain Ballad,&#8221; Bruce swaps out the last couple for two lines from &#8220;Downbound Train,&#8221; which Bruce had already completed writing:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Last night I stood on Black Mountain and looked out to the sea</em><br />\n<em>Where the waters of the Mystery River go rushing endlessly</em><br />\n<em>All she said was &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry Joe but I gotta go&#8221;</em><br />\n<em>We had it once but we ain&#8217;t got it anymore</em></p>\n<p>I have to believe those lines were intended as a temporary placeholder, if for no other reason than Bruce had just established the narrator&#8217;s name as John in the previous verse! But even if he had cleaned up the continuity error (and fixed the rhyme), the lines jar when joined to the narrator&#8217;s dreamtime reminiscence.</p>\n<p>I believe Bruce was searching for a way to contrast the words we utter when newly in love (<em>John, I love you so</em>) with the ones we say when that love dies (<em>We had it once but we ain&#8217;t got it anymore</em>), and it&#8217;s a great lyrical device. But it needed more than a skin graft to do it right, and so we&#8217;re left with a blemish on an otherwise beautiful and haunting song.</p>\n<p><strong>Black Mountain Ballad<br />\nRecorded: </strong>Early 1983<strong><br />\nReleased: </strong><em>L.A.
