He&#8217;s walking away from it with his head held high, even though he suspects he&#8217;s the one who&#8217;s been played.</p>\n<p>(An earlier take of the song included a verse that makes the narrator appear a bit vulnerable, but it also made him appear a bit of a victim. Bruce wisely decided to jettison it from the final version.)</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Hey, you may believe it ain&#8217;t real</em><br />\n<em>I don&#8217;t doubt the way I feel</em><br />\n<em>You walk real pretty and you talk real sweet</em><br />\n<em>Well baby I was born in the driving seat</em><br />\n<em>My life&#8217;s the same story, again and again</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;m on the outside looking in</em></p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Outside Lookin&#039; In\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ye66WuPgyJo?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;Outside Looking In&#8221; is a clever twist on a rock and roll classic, but it&#8217;s one that many listeners wouldn&#8217;t recognize beneath its familiar veneer.</p>\n<p>Bruce was wise to leave it off of <em>Darkness </em>but equally wise to dust it off three decades later for <i>The Promise</i>, his 2010 influence-wearing sleeve of an album.</p>\n<p><strong>Outside Looking In<br />\nRecorded:\u00a0</strong>September 27, 1977<br />\n<strong>Released:\u00a0</strong><em>The Promise</em> (2010)<br />\n<strong>First performed:</strong> December 7, 2010 (Asbury Park, NJ)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> December 7, 2010 (Asbury Park, NJ)</p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
