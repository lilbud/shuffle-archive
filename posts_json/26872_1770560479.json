He resurrected it for his latest album,\u00a0<em>Blues With Friends</em>, paring back the musical arrangement to better serve his lyrics.</p>\n<p>The backing vocals were pared back, too. Gone is the original backing choir, replaced by a soulful, mostly wordless vocal by Patti Scialfa, who Dion beseeched to provide a new arrangement to suit the new track.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I just wanted her to hum along on some of the solos, but she had a different idea,&#8221; Dion told <em>Rolling Stone</em>. &#8220;She had a whole other arrangement in mind and did this layering kind of thing and I just have to say she captured the wind of the holy spirit, truly something beautiful and sublime.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Patti&#8217;s husband was taken by it, too&#8211;so much so that he was moved to add his own contribution, a mid-song guitar solo.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"758\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7BJ4Kg3Dl_4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></div>\n<p>&#8220;Hymn to Him&#8221; was released as an online video single on May 1, 2020, a month in advance of\u00a0<em>Blues With Friends,\u00a0</em>to a generally positive reception.</p>\n<p>And while it doesn&#8217;t seem like a live performance is on the horizon any time soon, we can be grateful for one more beautiful piece of music from an otherwise mostly quiet year.</p>\n<p><strong>Hymn to Him<br />\nRecorded:</strong> Unknown<br />\n<strong>Released:\u00a0</strong><em>Blues With Friends\u00a0</em>(2020)<br />\n<strong>Never performed</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a9 April 26, 2021</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>When Dion resurrected his 1986 Christian rock hymn, he asked Patti Scialfa to provide new backing vocals.
