Garage Sessions &#8217;83 </em>at one point or another over the life of the blog,</p>\n<p>Sure there were two (&#8220;Follow That Dream&#8221; and &#8220;Sugarland&#8221;) I never got around to, but I knew what my hook would be for those songs years ago. I could write them pretty quickly.</p>\n<p>I also knew that a couple of songs differed from their earlier bootleg versions. No worries, I could lightly update those essays, too.</p>\n<p>I convinced myself that in a hour or three, I could polish a ragtag group of essays that would otherwise be destined for &#8220;miscellaneous&#8221; status into a <em>Roll of the Dice</em> volume written I&#8217;d presciently written years before the release of the album it examines.</p>\n<p>How could I resist that?</p>\n<p>Brimming with confidence and cushioned by an almost three-month lead time buffer, I announced this book as Volume 4 in the <em>Roll of the Dice </em>series, and I started to write.</p>\n<p>And that&#8217;s when reality set in.</p>\n<p>None of my above assumptions were incorrect. It didn&#8217;t take that long to write the new essays, and I actually enjoyed that part. And it was easy enough to update the entries for songs released elsewhere (&#8220;My Hometown,&#8221; &#8220;County Fair,&#8221; &#8220;Shut Out the Light,&#8221; &#8220;Johnny Bye Bye&#8221;).</p>\n<p>And a few of my previously-written\u00a0 essays for songs unique to this album (like &#8220;The Klansman&#8221; or &#8220;Little Girl Like You&#8221;) required very little if any changes.</p>\n<p>But the others&#8230; oy.</p>\n<p>What I hadn&#8217;t considered was the cross-pollination between so many tracks on this album, and the fact that the order in which Bruce wrote them, the order in which he sequenced them on the album, and the order in which I originally wrote about them were three distinctly different timelines.</p>\n<p>I discovered that in some cases, I&#8217;d buried an earlier song&#8217;s backstory deep toward the back of the album, or I&#8217;d compared two songs only to find out that the newly released version was more closely related to a different album-mate instead.</p>\n<p>Things got confusing pretty rapidly from there, and I started swapping paragraphs between essays like body parts in Frankenstein&#8217;s monster. And the essays started to reflect it. So I started polishing, scrubbing, deleting, rewriting, to the point where in some cases I lost track of what was original and what was new.</p>\n<p>The upshot is that this book contains more new writing than I ever intended (something I&#8217;m not likely to repeat in this year&#8217;s remaining volumes), and many of the pre-existing essays no longer resemble their original blog versions. I hope it&#8217;s coherent, but I&#8217;m still too close to it to judge.</p>\n<p>Consider this volume an outlier. I hope it compares well to the others, but if not, we&#8217;ll be back to our regularly scheduled program next month.</p>\n<p>Now let&#8217;s go to the garage.</p>\n<p>\u00a9 January 30, 2026</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>It seemed like a good idea at the time.
