If you&#8217;re asking about the album, the answer is: probably never. I haven&#8217;t written any album reviews on this blog and have no plans to. No particular reason other than that it doesn&#8217;t fit the theme I established on Day One. And besides, there are so many great reviews of the album out there that I doubt I could add anything of value to the discussion.</p>\n<p>But: if you&#8217;re wondering about &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/03/28/roll-of-the-dice-western-stars/\">Western Stars</a>&#8221; the\u00a0<em>song\u00a0</em>(or any other of the songs on the\u00a0<em>Western Stars\u00a0</em>album), the answer is: yes, I&#8217;ll write a <em>Roll of the Dice</em> essay on each of them sometime over the next three years or so.</p>\n<p>As soon as the album came out, I entered all the songs in my master spreadsheet of songs I haven&#8217;t yet written about, so as soon as the Google randomizer picks one of them for me to write about, that&#8217;s when I&#8217;ll do it.</p>\n<p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-attachment-id=\"11738\" data-permalink=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/07/18/bloggers-note-long-walk-home-book-review-and-reader-mail/xls/#main\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/xls.jpg?fit=496%2C523&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"496,523\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Ken Rosen&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1563452679&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"xls\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/xls.jpg?fit=285%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/xls.jpg?fit=496%2C523&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-11738 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/xls-285x300.jpg?resize=561%2C593\" alt=\"\" width=\"561\" height=\"593\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/xls.jpg?resize=285%2C300&amp;ssl=1 285w, https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/xls.jpg?w=496&amp;ssl=1 496w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 561px) 100vw, 561px\" /></p>\n<p>(Yes, that&#8217;s still how I plan out my content&#8211;I have every song Bruce has ever written, recorded, or covered in a master spreadsheet, and I&#8217;m whittling it down one by one, day by day.

Cohen and June Skinner Sawyers (the latter of whom should be familiar to collectors of written words devoted to Bruce Springsteen),\u00a0<em>Long Walk Home</em> is a thoughtful, provocative, and inconsistent (in a deliberate way) read.</p>\n<p>The book is comprised of 26 essays, thematically grouped. The expected categories are here, to be sure&#8211;Bruce as songwriter, Bruce as live performer, Bruce and politics, Bruce and religion, etc. But the most engrossing reads for me were the less commonly represented ones: Bruce and race, gender, sex, and&#8211;perhaps most significantly given the occasion of its publishing&#8211;Bruce and aging.</p>\n<p>I mentioned that the book is an inconsistent read, and honestly that&#8217;s probably the first word I&#8217;d use to describe it. Writing styles vary from dryly academic to page-turningly intimate, and the thematic organization sometimes leads to some jarring juxtapositions.\u00a0Some essays are meant as broad societal commentary, others are intensely personal.</p>\n<p>That means you&#8217;ll probably enjoy some essays more than others (I certainly did), but any Springsteen fan should appreciate each essay even though not all of them will resonate with you.</p>\n<p>As I mentioned earlier, all of this is, I&#8217;m sure, by design. If there&#8217;s an over-arching theme to the book besides simply a look back over an artist&#8217;s life, it&#8217;s that for an artist whose music and audience is typically pigeon-holed and stereotyped, Springsteen&#8217;s impact and influence is far more global and diverse than most of us realize.</p>\n<p>My favorite essays&#8211;the ones I most enjoyed while reading them&#8211;were the opening time-travelling autobiographical essay by Eric Alterman (which may be my single favorite Springsteen essay ever) and Peter Ames&#8217; Carlin hilarious tale of his youthful fan-fiction come true. While I certainly admire and appreciate their writing style and voice, I also recognize that I identify more with Alterman and Carlin than I do with most of the other writers.</p>\n<p>And that&#8217;s why more than a month after I finished reading\u00a0<em>Long Walk Home</em>, the stories that stay with me are the ones with perspectives foreign to my own:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Deepa Iyer shares with us how at age twelve, Bruce helped her adjust to her family&#8217;s move from India to Kentucky.</li>\n<li>Natalie Adler explores Bruce&#8217;s appeal to the lesbian community and the embodiment of butchness in his music.</li>\n<li>\u00a0Wayne Swan describes how Bruce&#8217;s music influenced Australian politics long before he ever traveled there.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are many others as well.</p>\n<p><em>Long Walk Home: Reflections on Bruce Springsteen</em> did something I wouldn&#8217;t have thought possible: it deepened my appreciation for the artist by broadening my understanding of his relevance and influence.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d long known that Bruce had wide, diverse, international appeal. Now I have a better understanding of\u00a0<em>why</em>.</p>\n<p>Highly recommended.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Long-Walk-Home-Reflections-Springsteen/dp/1978805268/ref=sr_1_2?crid=2XGOSTXHD4593&amp;keywords=long+walk+home&amp;qid=1563481342&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=long+walk+home%2Cstripbooks%2C209&amp;sr=1-2\">a link to the book on Amazon</a>, but if you can, support your local bookseller instead.</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>In which I review an upcoming book that marks Bruce&#8217;s 70th birthday and answer a couple of frequently asked questions.</p>\n", "protected": false}, "author": 1, "featured_media": 11741, "comment_status": "open", "ping_status": "open", "sticky": false, "template": "", "format": "standard", "meta": {"_monsterinsights_skip_tracking": false, "_monsterinsights_sitenote_active": false, "_monsterinsights_sitenote_note": "", "_monsterinsights_sitenote_category": 0, "jetpack_post_was_ever_published": false, "_jetpack_newsletter_access": "", "_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs": false, "_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id": 0, "_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content": false, "_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content": false, "footnotes": "", "jetpack_publicize_message": "", "jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled": true, "jetpack_social_post_already_shared": true, "jetpack_social_options": {"image_generator_settings": {"template": "highway", "default_image_id": 0, "font": "", "enabled": false}, "version": 2}}, "categories": [1], "tags": [2414, 2415, 2416], "class_list": ["post-11737", "post", "type-post", "status-publish", "format-standard", "has-post-thumbnail", "hentry", "category-uncategorized", "tag-long-walk-home-reflections-on-bruce-springsteen", "tag-reader-mail", "tag-western-stars"], "aioseo_notices": [], "jetpack_publicize_connections": [], "jetpack_featured_media_url": "https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/lwh-1.jpg?fit=1000%2C1000&ssl=1", "jetpack_sharing_enabled": true, "jetpack_shortlink": "https://wp.me/p9w3Lk-33j", "jetpack_likes_enabled": true, "jetpack-related-posts": [{"id": 30616, "url": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/11/04/two-faces-western-stars/", "url_meta": {"origin": 11737, "position": 0}, "title": "Two Faces: Western Stars", "author": "Ken", "date": "November 4, 2021", "format": false, "excerpt": "Introducing guest-blogger Katy Crane in her first of hopefully many appearances.
