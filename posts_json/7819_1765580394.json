And that&#8217;s precisely by design: our narrator&#8217;s punishment is his penitence. Unable to forgive himself or move on, he ensures that he&#8217;s forced to relive his love and retell his loss every day.</p>\n<p>Musically, Bruce slowed and recycled the melody he used for &#8220;Little Girl Like You&#8221; a few weeks earlier. Lyrically, however, &#8220;Seven Tears&#8221; is a masterful example of economy in songwriting. Both &#8220;Little Girl Like You&#8221; and &#8220;Seven Tears&#8221; are about ninety seconds long, but whereas the former is a lazy trifle, the latter is a complete tale with an emotional wallop.</p>\n<p>It deserves its official release on <em>L.A.
