I actually had a book called <em>Only Lovers Left Alive</em> when I was in high school, because I read that the Rolling Stones had licensed that book to make a movie. This is early, like when the Stones first hit. I had the book for years and years. It probably just fell apart, it was a little paperback, and I always liked the title of it: <em>Only Lovers Left Alive</em>.\u00a0So I fashioned a story.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 13pt;\">&#8212; <i>Joe Grushecky, July 2020</i></span></p></blockquote>\n<p>It&#8217;s a hell of a story.</p>\n<p>Joe Grushecky&#8217;s milestone <em><a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/10/17/american-babylon-a-retrospective/\">American Babylon</a>\u00a0</em>album ends on a dark and dire note. Told from the point of view of a boy abandoned by his father, &#8220;Only Lovers Left Alive&#8221; is the gritty mirror image of Bruce Springsteen&#8217;s &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/12/21/roll-of-the-dice-hungry-heart/\">Hungry Heart</a>.&#8221; If you&#8217;ve ever wondered what it must have felt like to be the ones at home when Bruce&#8217;s character went out for a ride and never came back, look no further.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Only Lovers Left Alive\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_JGAd81f--4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>The absent father in &#8220;Only Lovers Left Alive&#8221; is laden with rock and roll imagery from his tattoo to his shoes, as if to caution the price that life on the road can exact. It doesn&#8217;t require a leap of imagination to picture the father as a musician, and his bike as a tour bus.</p>\n<p>The father never returns, and looking for a place to belong, the son takes up with the tough crowd, skipping school, acting cool, and probably playing pool, too. While I&#8217;m sure the lyrical similarities to &#8220;Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)&#8221; are coincidental, they&#8217;re also satisfyingly and fittingly ironic. Like much of <em>American Babylon, </em>&#8220;Only Lovers Left Alive&#8221; is as grounded in realism as Bruce&#8217;s early work is rooted in romanticism.</p>\n<p>The song ends on an unresolved note; we never do find out whether the son takes after his father. &#8220;Only Lovers Left Alive&#8221; lingers long after its last notes close out\u00a0<em>American Babylon,\u00a0</em>a fitting way to end an album that questions what happens when we lose our ability to tell right from wrong.</p>\n<p>Joe and Bruce have never performed &#8220;Only Lovers Left Alive&#8221; in concert, but Bruce&#8217;s guitar can be heard on the studio track. Intriguingly, Joe told me in our\u00a0<em>American Babylon\u00a0</em>conversation last year that an alternate but unreleased version exists with a long guitar solo by Bruce. If we&#8217;re lucky, maybe that will see the light of day someday&#8230;</p>\n<p><strong>Update 10/29/21:\u00a0</strong>That track has seen the light of day! Take a listen to this terrific demo (that term hardly seems to do it justice) of &#8220;Only Lovers Left Alive&#8221; with a terrific Springsteen guitar solo, from the brand-new <a href=\"https://orcd.co/JoeGrusheckyAmericanBabylon25\">25th anniversary edition of <em>American Babylon</em></a>.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Only Lovers
