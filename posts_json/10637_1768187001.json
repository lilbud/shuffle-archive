The song was originally written by Billy Gashade shortly after James was murdered by Robert Ford (more on that in a few days). Gashade&#8217;s lyrics glamorize and romanticize James as a Robin Hood figure, but history does not support that portrayal.</p>\n<p>History tells us that James was in fact a brutal thief and murderer who didn&#8217;t share his bounty with anyone outside of his gang. Nevertheless the James-as-populist portrayal quickly took hold in popular culture, and James continued to be a larger-than-life figure certainly into and through Bruce&#8217;s childhood.</p>\n<p>Perhaps it&#8217;s Bruce&#8217;s fascination with the old west that led him to record &#8220;Jesse James,&#8221; or perhaps it was reluctance to let go of a childhood anti-hero. (This isn&#8217;t the first time Bruce has recorded a song about Jesse James&#8211;see &#8220;The Ballad of Jesse James&#8221; on <em>Chapter and</em> <em>Verse</em>, or the unreleased &#8220;Cowboys of the Sea&#8221; or &#8220;Robert Ford.&#8221;) Or maybe Bruce simply views &#8220;Jesse James&#8221; as\u00a0 a musical ancestor to &#8220;Johnny 99,&#8221; an outlaw that makes for a great story if not a true one.</p>\n<p>In any event, &#8220;Jesse James&#8221; was the first song recorded during the Seeger Sessions, one of the earliest songs on the CD, and an early and standout staple on the Seeger Sessions tour setlists.</p>\n<p>In concert, &#8220;Jesse James&#8221; immediately became a showcase for banjoist Greg Liszt as early as the tour kick-off at the New Orleans Jazz Festival.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Jesse James (Just Ask) (Live at the New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival, 2006)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WBuU_NyVxu8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Liszt&#8217;s solo quickly became a fan favorite moment, and by the end of the tour in Dublin more than six months later, we can clearly see how much Liszt came to enjoy his nightly four-fingered spotlight moment.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen with the Sessions Band - Jesse James (Live In Dublin)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hn9hr0RbFCU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;Jesse James&#8221; also carries the distinction of being one of the few Seeger Sessions songs to successfully (and repeatedly) translate to the E Street stage.
