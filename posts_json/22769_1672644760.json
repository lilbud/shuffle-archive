Today, we bring you not one but <em>two</em> terrific covers of &#8220;I&#8217;m on Fire&#8221; courtesy of the fine folks at Scary Pockets.</p>\n<p>Wait, wait! Don&#8217;t leave! I know we&#8217;ve spotlit a ton of &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/09/11/roll-of-the-dice-im-on-fire/\">I&#8217;m on Fire</a>&#8221; covers already, and truth be told the list of remaining ones could keep a blog going all by themselves.</p>\n<p>But that just means the bar is high for what makes the cut to include, and both of these are well worth checking out.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve featured the work of Scary Pockets before&#8211;they&#8217;re a Los Angeles-based covers band that funkifies classic songs with a rotating cast of guest vocalists. About a year ago, we took a look at their <a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/12/01/cover-me-scary-pockets-and-darren-criss-dancing-in-the-dark/\">irresistible take</a> on &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/12/25/roll-of-the-dice-dancing-in-the-dark/\">Dancing in the Dark</a>&#8221; with Darrin Criss.</p>\n<p>Today, they&#8217;ve recruited <a href=\"https://www.rettmadison.com/\">Rett Madison</a>, a new singer-songwriter on the music scene who&#8217;s already generating quite a bit of mainstream buzz in advance of her debut album. Together, Madison and Scary Pockets deliver a powerfully funky cover of &#8220;I&#8217;m on Fire&#8221; that&#8217;ll have you dancing by the one-minute mark.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"I&#039;m On Fire | Bruce Springsteen | Scary Pockets cover ft.

A few months back, we checked out<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/07/17/cover-me-stories-featuring-garrison-starr/\"> their version</a> of Bruce&#8217;s &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/09/21/roll-of-the-dice-born-in-the-u-s-a/\">Born in the U.S.A.</a>&#8221; featuring Garrison Starr.</p>\n<p>That wasn&#8217;t the only time they acoustically tackled one of Bruce&#8217;s songs, though. Here&#8217;s prolific singer-songwriter <a href=\"http://www.georgekrikes.net/\">George Krikes</a> (with three albums and five EPs under his belt between his band and solo efforts) and his moody, melodic cover of &#8220;I&#8217;m on Fire.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"i&#039;m on fire | bruce springsteen | \u2018stories\u2019 acoustic cover ft. george krikes\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LanWcg8is6U?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Want more cool covers?
