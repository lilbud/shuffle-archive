Tour. Bruce had just finished the main set of his tenth and final homecoming show at the Brendan Byrne Arena in East Rutherford, when he surprised and overjoyed fans by calling former bandmate Little Steven to the stage. Following a perhaps predictable &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/05/28/roll-of-the-dice-two-hearts/\">Two Hearts</a>&#8221; (which almost always has their friendship as its subtext), Bruce promised &#8220;something special for you tonight.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Following an almost mournful introduction by The Miami Horns, Bruce sang Mentor Williams&#8217; instantly recognizable opening lyrics. Bruce&#8217;s vocals dripped with emotion and perfectly conveyed the &#8220;lost in the wilderness&#8221; setup of the song&#8217;s first verse; Steve&#8217;s response promised lifelong friendship and loyalty beyond the ad-libbed &#8220;twenty years you&#8217;ve given me.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The rest of the performance&#8230; well, it&#8217;s better to just listen. You&#8217;ll feel the strength of their bond as if you were there.</p>\n<div id=\"v-vobRmus7-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='426' src='https://videopress.com/embed/vobRmus7?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>Bruce and Steve reprised their duet toward the end of the year in Memphis (without the Miami Horns, though), but after that the song disappeared from Bruce&#8217;s repertoire.</p>\n<p>It remained a fan favorite, though, based on the bootlegs of that first performance that circulated widely over the years. And that&#8217;s probably why when the era of sign requests arrived, fans started bringing signs for it.</p>\n<p>On August 18, 2012 (almost 28 years to the day since its first performance), Bruce granted the request late in the encores at his Wrecking Ball show in Foxborough, singing the first verse unaccompanied until the band (and the fans) joined a the chorus to carry the rest of the song.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Drift Away - (Full Version)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ckwC2U4gn-Q?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Bruce played &#8220;Drift Away&#8221; once more (to date at least), in the spring of 2013 in Hannover, Germany.
