Looking back on it, most of those early songs were comparatively tame by today&#8217;s standards.</p>\n<p>There were exceptions, though.</p>\n<p>One of them was &#8220;It Ain&#8217;t the Meat (It&#8217;s the Motion)&#8221; by The Swallows, which might have been a hit if it had received national airplay. &#8220;Everybody liked it everywhere,&#8221; recalled Eddie Rich of The Swallows, &#8220;[but] you couldn&#8217;t play it.&#8221; It became a regional hit in the South, though, where the double entendre-laden lyrics and the rocking accompaniment earned it both appreciation and notoriety.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"THE SWALLOWS ~ IT AIN`T THE MEAT ~ 1951 .\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lpPeQyT36Tg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>If you were unfamiliar with the song before now, you might suspect you know what the song&#8217;s title is referring to.\u00a0And you&#8217;d almost certainly be wrong.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s because in 1974, Maria Muldaur covered &#8220;It Ain&#8217;t the Meat,&#8221; switching the lyrics from a man&#8217;s to a woman&#8217;s perspective.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"It Ain&#039;t the Meat It&#039;s the Motion\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8IkNDzvCswU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Muldaur&#8217;s version injected the title phrase into the popular vernacular, and &#8220;it ain&#8217;t the meat, it&#8217;s the motion&#8221; became a clever euphemism for saying that penis size doesn&#8217;t matter if you&#8217;ve got technique.</p>\n<p>However, the &#8220;meat&#8221; of the original song referred to the singer&#8217;s female lovers, and that&#8217;s the version that Southside Johnny rescued from obscurity when he covered it for his 1976 debut album, <em>I Don&#8217;t Want to Go Home, </em>with original Juke Kenny &#8220;Popeye&#8221; Pentifallo doing his best Irving Turner impression (and making it clear the band was familiar with the original track).</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"It Ain&#039;t the Meat (It&#039;s the Motion) (2016 Remaster)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mOwunYrOOhQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;It Ain&#8217;t the Meat (It&#8217;s the Motion)&#8221; was a reliable crowd-pleaser in either version, and it made frequent appearances in Southside&#8217;s early sets (and still makes appearances to this day).</p>\n<p>Despite their many on-stage team-ups, however, Bruce Springsteen has never joined Southside\u00a0 for this particular song. He came close one time, though&#8211;when Bruce joined the Jukes, the E Street Band, and Ronnie Spector as part of a two-nights-only supergroup called The Asbury Park All-Star Revue.</p>\n<p>The Revue was the brainchild of Steven Van Zandt, the nexus linking the Jukes and the E Street Band, when Southside took ill in the spring of 1977 and was unable to perform at a run of shows timed to support his newly released second album.</p>\n<p>Stevie assembled the artists on a single stage, fronting the group for Southside&#8217;s material while Bruce took the lead for his own songs. Springsteen was on stage the whole night, however, playing guitar when he wasn&#8217;t singing.</p>\n<p>And that&#8217;s exactly what we can hear him doing in this recording of his one and only known performance of &#8220;It Ain&#8217;t the Meat (It&#8217;s the Motion)&#8221; &#8212; supporting the band on guitar, while Van Zandt handles the frontman duties.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"IT AIN&#039;T THE MEAT (IT&#039;S THE MOTION) : The Swallows cover\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GZFy95xRBnc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Yeah, I know that&#8217;s not the clearest of recordings, but it&#8217;s the only one we&#8217;ve got.
