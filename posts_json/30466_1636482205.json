But the fact that we have a significant number of recordings dating back more than a decade earlier boggles my mind.</p>\n<p>But what&nbsp;<em>really</em> blows me away is that we have surviving recordings of <em>seventeen-year-old</em> Bruce Springsteen fronting his very first band, The Castiles. What are the odds that someone would have recorded a high school band in 1967 (it wasn&#8217;t as easy as holding up a mobile phone back then) let alone preserved it for a half-century after?</p>\n<p>We can thank Father Fred Coleman for that. He was the one who saw the boys&#8217; potential and recorded their stage performance for posterity. (Read about Father Coleman <a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/11/09/roll-of-the-dice-look-into-my-window/\">here</a>.)</p>\n<p>One of the songs he captured for us on tape was a cover of Lee Dorsey&#8217;s funky 1965 single, &#8220;Get Out of My Life, Woman,&#8221; which peaked at #44 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #5 on the R&amp;B chart in 1966.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Lee Dorsey - Get Out Of My Life Woman\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uxp0Kfgpft8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Although Bruce and the boys were almost certainly aware of the original, given its popularity just a year before they covered it, their arrangement was also clearly influenced by The Paul Butterfield Blues Band&#8217;s cover, released in the summer of 1966.</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ub35rttSDYs</p>\n<p>We can hear that version inform The Castiles&#8217; performance at their September 1967 gig at The Left Foot in Freehold. It&#8217;s more rock than funk, and more urgent than either Dorsey&#8217;s or Butterfield&#8217;s versions. Only a minute of audio circulates, but it&#8217;s enough for us to get an appreciation for the young band&#8217;s growing ability to make an established song their own.</p>\n<div id=\"v-EcoWtAga-1\"
