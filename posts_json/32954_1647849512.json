It missed the Top 40 in the U.S., but it reached #6 on the U.S. R&amp;B chart. Still, we know it came to Bruce&#8217;s attention early on, because Steven Van Zandt arranged it in stunning fashion for Southside Johnny&#8217;s 1977 album, <em>This Time It&#8217;s For Real.</em></p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Without Love\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/j6n21vZIOEQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Stevie&#8217;s arrangement is bold, brash, lush and orchestral, and Southside&#8217;s vocals are at their soulful best.

(It was known at the time as the Monmouth Arts Center.)\u00a0With Southside unable to perform and with a weeks-old new album in need of a promotional push, Stevie saved the day by fronting the Jukes and enlisting Bruce and the rest of the E Street Band along with Ronnie Spector to form a one-time-only supergroup called The Asbury Park All-Star Revue.</p>\n<p>Bruce stayed on backing vocals and guitar for most of the set, including &#8220;Without Love,&#8221;
