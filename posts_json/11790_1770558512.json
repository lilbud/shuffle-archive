On its first release, &#8220;The Harder They Come&#8221; was backed with &#8220;Many Rivers to Cross,&#8221; which Bruce performed regularly on World Tour 1993. On re-release, the single was backed by Cliff&#8217;s &#8220;Trapped,&#8221; which has been a fan favorite at Bruce&#8217;s shows for four decades.</p>\n<p>Bruce did cover the A-side, though&#8211;once and once only, at a very special show.</p>\n<p>In 2012, Bruce keynoted the SxSW festival in Austin, and afterward he played a full concert at Moody Theater with the E Street Band and a stellar array of guest artists. One of Bruce&#8217;s guests that night was Jimmy Cliff himself, and the two artists kicked off their three-song mini-set with Bruce&#8217;s one and only performance of &#8220;The Harder They Come.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Fortunately, the venue was intimate enough that several filmers were able to preserve their performance for posterity. Here&#8217;s one of the best ones.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\"
