In fact, a first cut was recorded on the very first day of recording sessions. Bruce worked on it throughout the early days of the summer of &#8217;77, and one of those early July recordings escaped into the wild as a bootleg.</p>\n<audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-23071-2\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/113-Lets-Go-Tonight-v2.mp3?_=2\" /><a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/113-Lets-Go-Tonight-v2.mp3\">https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/113-Lets-Go-Tonight-v2.mp3</a></audio>\n<p>In the clip above, we can clearly hear that this is a song where the music preceded the lyrics&#8211;melodically, &#8220;Come On (Let&#8217;s Go Tonight)&#8221;/&#8221;Factory&#8221; was fully formed from the beginning (even if it lacks the gorgeous David Lindley violin overdub that was added later).</p>\n<p>Lyrically, though, this is definitely an early draft. There&#8217;s a lot of bluffing going on, but there&#8217;s at least one gem of a line that Bruce ultimately discarded but which truly deserved to be adopted elsewhere:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Everybody wants heaven, but nobody wants to die.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>Man, that&#8217;s a great line.</p>\n<p>By autumn, Bruce would evolve his lyrics to focus on his father, and &#8220;Come On (Let&#8217;s Go Tonight)&#8221; morphed into &#8220;The Factory Song&#8221; and finally &#8220;Factory.&#8221; During the summer, though, it remained a song focused on the brevity of life and the opportunity cost of living (which is actually not that far removed from what &#8220;Factory&#8221; is about).</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Put on your black dress baby, and put your hair up right</em><br />\n<em>There&#8217;s a party way down in Factory Town tonight</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;ll be going down there if you need a ride</em><br />\n<em>Come on, come on, let&#8217;s go tonight</em></p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s acknowledge the obvious: the first couplet eventually made it to &#8220;Out in the Street,&#8221; and the second one to &#8220;Johnny Bye Bye.&#8221; But taken on its own, we have an introductory verse that sets the scene: there&#8217;s a &#8220;party&#8221; going down, but the black dress implies that &#8220;party &#8221; is a euphemism. We&#8217;re about to find out what for.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>How many men fail, their dreams denied</em><br />\n<em>They walk through these streets with death in their eyes</em><br />\n<em>Now the man on the radio says &#8220;Elvis Presley died&#8221;</em><br />\n<em>Come on, come on, let&#8217;s go tonight</em></p>\n<p>As with &#8220;Johnny Bye Bye,&#8221; our song is set on the night that Elvis died. That was an event that hit Bruce hard, both because of the loss of an idol and the reinforcement of a lesson: success doesn&#8217;t necessarily breed contentment.</p>\n<p>This middle verse is the crux of the song, and it&#8217;s a haunting one. Until this point in his career, Bruce was famously and obsessively focused on his craft and his success. He knew he was in a business where few made it big, and he knew what blue-collar fate awaited him if a musical career didn&#8217;t pan out.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Factory&#8221; eventually became a song about the cost of surrendering your dreams to the monotony that comes with compromise, with Bruce&#8217;s father as the point-of-view character. The early draft that is &#8220;Come On (Let&#8217;s Go Tonight),&#8221; however,&#8221; reveals that Bruce may have been projecting with &#8220;Factory.&#8221; It&#8217;s clear from this early version that Bruce was intensely aware how tenuous success could be.</p>\n<p>And yet like the best of Bruce&#8217;s songs, &#8220;Come On (Let&#8217;s Go Tonight)&#8221; operates on other levels as well: if Elvis&#8217; death hit the songwriter existentially, Bruce brought his nameless mourners and celebrants along\u00a0 for the ride. These men and women had long ago given up their dreams and accepted &#8220;ordinary&#8221; jobs, but they were able to escape vicariously through popular music.</p>\n<p>But then the music died, and with it went the escapism. If even Elvis could be haunted by demons, what hope did common folk have?</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well now some came to witness, now some came to weep</em><br />\n<em>Drawn by death&#8217;s strange glory, they stood in the street</em><br />\n<em>Drawn together forever in the promise of an endless sleep</em><br />\n<em>Come on, come on, let&#8217;s go tonight</em></p>\n<p>There&#8217;s something about death that reminds us of life. We gather, in part to remember the departed, but in part to remind ourselves that\u00a0<em>we are still here</em>. There is indeed a strange glory in death&#8211;as Bruce wrote earlier,\u00a0<em>everybody wants heaven, but nobody wants to die</em>. We miss the fallen, but celebrate their escape to the afterlife.</p>\n<p>That penultimate line stays with us: <em>drawn together forever in the promise of an endless sleep</em>.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not that our mourners are suicidal; it&#8217;s that the emptiness of an unfulfilling life can make the idea of an endless sleep seem like a great relief. But before we have a chance to ponder that notion, Bruce takes us into the final chorus&#8211;and we realize that far from a meaningless refrain, &#8220;come on, come on, let&#8217;s go tonight&#8221; is a reminder to\u00a0<em>keep going</em>.</p>\n<p>Keep moving forward, even if right now there doesn&#8217;t seem to be much of a point to doing so.</p>\n<p>This is dark stuff, to be sure. But so is &#8220;Factory,&#8221; and most of <em>Darkness on the Edge of Town</em>.\u00a0A little goes a long way. (Sorry, all you\u00a0<em>Darkness</em> lovers&#8211;it&#8217;s my least favorite Springsteen album.)</p>\n<p>So yes, &#8220;Come On (Let&#8217;s Go Tonight)&#8221; is often dismissed as a work-in-progress &#8220;Factory,&#8221; but I&#8217;d argue that it&#8217;s a more mature and sophisticated composition than the version that made it onto\u00a0<em>Darkness on the Edge of Town</em>.</p>\n<p>Still, &#8220;Factory&#8221; remains the better-known song, and it would probably only confuse casual fans if Bruce were to play the earlier song in concert. To date, he&#8217;s only done so once, at his private Asbury Park carousel webcast/video shoot in 2010, of which no recording circulates.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Come On (Let&#8217;s Go Tonight)&#8221; is likely to remain a deep cut obscurity, deserving of more consideration than it receives.</p>\n<p><strong>Come On (Let&#8217;s Go Tonight)<br />\nRecorded: </strong>Late 1977<br />\n<strong>Released:</strong>\u00a0<em>The Promise\u00a0</em>(2010)<br />\n<strong>First performed:</strong> December 7, 2010 (Asbury Park, NJ)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> December 7, 2010 (Asbury Park, NJ)</p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
