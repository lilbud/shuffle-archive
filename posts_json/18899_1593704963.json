Unlike Bruce, who sojourned for a while in Southern California, Joe remains steadfastly rooted to the Iron City.</p>\n<p>Might he have made it big(ger) if he&#8217;d moved somewhere with a more vibrant music industry? Who knows. But in the title track of his 2009 album <em>East Carson Street,\u00a0</em>Joe adamantly rejects the notion that one has to leave home to find satisfaction.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"East Carson Street\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SF5NeWREX5I?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;East Carson Street&#8221; feels too personal to not be at least somewhat autobiographical, but Joe is too skilled a songwriter to narrow his song&#8217;s resonance. &#8220;East Carson Street&#8221; feels universal, a song for anyone lucky enough to already have a sense of community and belonging that no amount of fame and fortune could ever buy.</p>\n<p>Oh, and the Springsteen connection?
