As Bruce testified, in person they were mesmerizing.</p>\n<p>Take a few minutes to watch their performance from the 1967 Stax/Volt Revue, when their song was still riding the charts. (In fact, the date of the performance was April 7, 1967&#8211;the exact day it peaked at #2 on the R&amp;B chart.) It&#8217;s missing the first verse, but you&#8217;ll still feel the duo&#8217;s full power.</p>\n<div id=\"v-5uDR5grZ-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='568' src='https://videopress.com/embed/5uDR5grZ?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>If that performance doesn&#8217;t floor you, you best get someone to take your pulse.</p>\n<p>Now, no one would dare dispute the essentialness of Dave Prater&#8217;s gritty vocals to the Sam and Dave recipe, but Sam Moore especially commanded Bruce&#8217;s respect as a bandleader. Bruce appreciated Dave, but he\u00a0<em>studied</em> Sam&#8211;and he incorporated those lessons into his own performances.</p>\n<p>So it must have been a thrill for Bruce when he had the opportunity to perform classic Sam and Dave songs with Sam during his 2003 holiday shows in Asbury Park.</p>\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t the first time Sam and Bruce had worked together. In fact, Sam appears on Bruce&#8217;s studio recordings of &#8220;Soul Driver,&#8221; &#8220;Real World&#8221; and &#8220;Man&#8217;s Job.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But it was their first time performing on stage together, and Bruce clearly relished the opportunity. They brought the crowd to their feet each night with rousing rockers like &#8220;I Thank You&#8221; and &#8220;Hold On, I&#8217;m Comin&#8217;,&#8221; but for me the highlight was their team-up on Sam and Dave&#8217;s only hit ballad, &#8220;When Something is Wrong With My Baby.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"758\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fHCMfPataiE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></div>\n<p>Bruce is clearly in awe of his idol throughout their performance, but he summons Dave&#8217;s gritty, earthy vocals when called on. Their harmonies are wonderful, and Sam&#8217;s stage patter and command of the crowd is delightful.</p>\n<p>Sam and Bruce only performed &#8220;When Something Is Wrong With My Baby&#8221; three times (in a four-day period!) back in the 2003 holiday season, but they made those few performances count.</p>\n<p><strong>When Something Is Wrong With My Baby<br />\nFirst performed:</strong> December 5,
