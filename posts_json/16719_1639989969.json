We didn&#8217;t see\u00a0<em>that </em>twist coming the first time we heard this song, did we? Our narrator is literally on the lam, dodging the police officers and staying one step ahead of the APB out for his arrest.</p>\n<p>And that chorus&#8211;we get one more go-round to drive the point home: perhaps the hail of bullets and flaming gasoline is a bit of action movie grandeur infusing his recollection, but his life-on-the-run is real, with no hint of safety in the near future.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I went screaming from the final scene</em><br />\n<em>In a hail of bullets and flaming gasoline</em><br />\n<em>As the credits rolled away</em><br />\n<em>They were still chasing the man who got away</em></p>\n<p>Why in the world didn&#8217;t Bruce include this terrific song on <em>The River</em>? I can&#8217;t answer that one. It should have been on it, and we should have had at least one live performance of along the way.</p>\n<p>But other than its under-the-radar official release in the anniversary box set, &#8220;The Man Who Got Away&#8221; continues to be a great song that got away, too.</p>\n<p>&#8212;</p>\n<p><strong>Bonus #1:\u00a0</strong>Here&#8217;s an inside look at Bruce working on an early acoustic version of &#8220;The Man Who Got Away.&#8221; The lyrics are very different&#8211;the song would evolve considerably before Bruce brought it to the band.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen Man Who Got Away #2 Acoustic Demo\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KaOta11KKKU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><strong>Bonus #2:\u00a0</strong>Although it took more than 35 years for us to get an official release of &#8220;The Man Who Got Away,&#8221; we did get a glimpse of it much, much earlier when a recording of an E Street Band rehearsal escaped into the wild.
