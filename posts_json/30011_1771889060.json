Perhaps that&#8217;s because he was waiting to perform it with the songwriter himself.</p>\n<p>He first got that opportunity at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#8217;s 1993 induction ceremony, when Creedence Clearwater Revival joined the Hall&#8217;s pantheon. Choosing to perform without CCR behind him, Fogerty assembled a backing band that included Robbie Robertson, Don Was, and Bruce Springsteen on backing\u00a0 vocals and guitar.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"758\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8wbsWOsM9qs?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></div>\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t much of a team-up, though. The focus was squarely on Fogerty, Bruce can be heard and seen only fleetingly, and the vibe was more than a little awkward due to the noticeable absence of the band being inducted.</p>\n<p>Things were a bit more relaxed the next time Bruce and John joined forces on &#8220;Green River,&#8221; at John&#8217;s birthday party at his home two years later.</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"VideoPress Video Player\" aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='563' height='1000' src='https://videopress.com/embed/NBTpKUzm?at=368&amp;hd=0&amp;cover=1' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script src='https://v0.wordpress.com/js/next/videopress-iframe.js?m=1770107250'></script></p>\n<p>Bruce was a little more into it that night but still ceded the spotlight to Fogerty. (It was his party, after all.)</p>\n<p>But like I said at the top: the third time&#8217;s the charm.</p>\n<p>In 2014, at Bruce&#8217;s third appearance at the New Orleans Jazz Festival, the stars finally aligned. Fogerty joined Bruce and the E Street Band on stage (along with fellow special guest Rickie Lee Jones) for a venue-appropriate smoking performance of &#8220;Green River&#8221;&#8211; and this time Bruce and John shared lead vocals and a guitar duel.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"758\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wiH1MXrcWaA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></div>\n<p>That was actually the\u00a0eighth time Bruce had played &#8220;Green River&#8221; in concert, but it was the first time on a proper concert stage.
