I have no idea.</p>\n<p>And finally, more than a decade after\u00a0<em>that,\u00a0</em>Bruce finally put this dark, deceptively upbeat rockabilly outtake on an album&#8230; on the &#8220;bonus disc&#8221; of the limited-edition version of\u00a0<em>The Essential Bruce Springsteen</em>.</p>\n<p>Geez. You&#8217;d think the guy was embarrassed about the song or something. It&#8217;s not as if it couldn&#8217;t have fit on\u00a0<em>Nebraska&#8211;</em>it&#8217;s not even two minutes long! But the most likely reason for &#8220;The Big Payback&#8221; not making it onto <em>Nebraska</em> is that it&#8217;s too close in sound\u00a0to &#8220;Open All Night.&#8221; The two songs start out virtually identically, in fact. Take a listen to the A-side:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Open All Night\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TxuXBj3EjOs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8230;and now listen to the B-side:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"The Big Payback (Single B-side - 1982)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Aw4gWPl_YP4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>I&#8217;d argue that &#8220;The Big Payback&#8221; is just as taut and edgy as &#8220;Open All Night&#8221; but even more fun to sing along to.</p>\n<p>In typical Nebraska fashion, &#8220;The Big Payback&#8221; features an anti-hero, but it&#8217;s a slow burn until we realize that. At first, we think we&#8217;re just being introduced to another of Bruce&#8217;s stock working stiff characters:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>I bought a scooter and I rented a shack</em><br />\n<em>Out in the sun by the railroad track</em><br />\n<em>I got a job and I&#8217;m a-breaking my back</em><br />\n<em>Working and working for the big payback</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>I keep a-putting and a-puttin&#8217; out</em><br />\n<em>I keep a-sweating like all get out</em><br />\n<em>I work so long that I&#8217;m a-losing track</em><br />\n<em>Waiting waiting on the big payback</em></p>\n<p>Our narrator, Bobby (we&#8217;ll soon learn his name), is doing hard, honest labor with the expectation of a big payday. But it never comes. His job uses him, drains him, and he knows it will someday discard him like a cheap one-night stand once it&#8217;s taken all it can take from him:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Well it&#8217;s a wham-bam, thank you ma&#8217;am, goddamn, look out Sam</em><br />\n<em>It&#8217;s a gone dead train rumbling down this track</em><br />\n<em>They got your neck in the noose, you&#8217;re dragging long in back</em><br />\n<em>Chasing and chasing the big payback</em></p>\n<p>Now it&#8217;d be one thing if Bobby had some solidarity out there on the line. But he seems to be on his own, sweating and toiling while his foreman&#8230; well, I&#8217;m pretty sure we don&#8217;t need Urban Dictionary to tell us what &#8220;diddy wack wack&#8221; is in reference to. (But I&#8217;m dying to know how Bruce came up with the phrase.)</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Oh what my foreman does well I don&#8217;t know</em><br />\n<em>He just throws me a shovel and yells &#8220;Go, Bobby, Go&#8221;</em><br />\n<em>Oh well-a all day long he&#8217;s just a diddy wack wack</em><br />\n<em>While I&#8217;m sweating and sweating for the big payback</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Yeah it&#8217;s a wham bam, thank you ma&#8217;am, god damn, look out Sam</em><br />\n<em>It&#8217;s a gone dead train rumbling down the track</em><br />\n<em>They got your neck in the noose, your hands are tied up in back</em><br />\n<em>And you&#8217;re a-working and working for the big payback</em></p>\n<p>And now the song turns sinister, both lyrically and vocally:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>I quit that job and Mister I ain&#8217;t going back</em><br />\n<em>Got me a knife and she&#8217;s a long and black</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;ll tell you how I make my piece at night Mac</em><br />\n<em>Down in the alley of the big payback</em></p>\n<p>Bobby&#8217;s looking for the easy money now, lying in wait in a dark alley with long knife. And those &#8220;gone dead train&#8221; and &#8220;neck in the noose&#8221; metaphors&#8230; well, they don&#8217;t seem so metaphorical now that they&#8217;re turned around:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>I go a wham bam, thank you ma&#8217;am, god damn, c&#8217;mon man</em><br />\n<em>You&#8217;re a gone dead train rumbling down this track</em><br />\n<em>I got your neck in the noose and I don&#8217;t give a damn Jack</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;m on that long lost highway of the big payback</em></p>\n<p>Bobby repeats that last line as the song fades, heading farther down the dark path he&#8217;s chosen, paying back the world in violence for the perceived injustice done to him.</p>\n<p>Like I said: this is\u00a0<em>Nebraska\u00a0</em>material through and through. It&#8217;s also some of Bruce&#8217;s best songwriting: tight, taut, deceptively slight and increasingly sinister.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The Big Payback&#8221; deserves a lot more exposure than it gets. Bruce has never once played it in concert&#8211;not even during the Ghost of Tom Joad Tour, where it would have worked nicely. And while we don&#8217;t have a full-band arrangement to listen to, it&#8217;s not hard to imagine the E Street Band having a ton of fun with it on stage.</p>\n<p>So maybe Bruce will someday remember about &#8220;The Big Payback&#8221; and give Bobby a chance to make it big on stage. But given Bobby&#8217;s bad luck and karma, it&#8217;s more likely he&#8217;ll stay condemned to lurking in the dark alleys of B-sides and bonus discs.</p>\n<p><strong>The Big Payback</strong><br />\n<strong>Recorded:</strong> January-April 1982<br />\n<strong>Released:</strong>\u00a0<em>The Essential Bruce Springsteen\u00a0</em>(2003)<br />\n<strong>Never performed</strong></p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
