Wilson Pickett was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in January 1991, and Bruce was on-hand along with a host of other rock icons to pay tribute.</p>\n<p>The\u00a0 evening would undoubtedly have culminated in an all-star jam with Pickett that included &#8220;In the Midnight Hour,&#8221; but there was only one problem: Pickett&#8217;s flight was delayed due to fog, and he missed the entire event. (It was the start of a bad decade for the notoriously flawed Pickett.)</p>\n<p>Instead, John Fogerty, Chaka Khan, and Phoebe Snow traded lead vocals with Bruce (backed by Jackson Browne, Bonnie Raitt, Don Henley, and more) on &#8220;In the Midnight Hour.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"758\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/S3eEz680qYg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></div>\n<p>It was a great performance, but it couldn&#8217;t match the experience of Bruce and Wilson sharing a stage together.
