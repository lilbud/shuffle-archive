As Bruce would put it many years later, <em>Human Touch\u00a0</em>in particular was &#8220;star-challenged.&#8221; And for good reason: the album sounds like an artist trying to find his footing in a high-tech studio. It&#8217;s overly slick, over-produced, and more dated-sounding than anything else in Bruce&#8217;s catalog.</p>\n<p data-path-to-node=\"3\"><em>Lucky Town,\u00a0</em>however, is a different story. It suffered from mere proximity to its fraternal twin; had it been released a year later, it might have earned the reception it deserved.</p>\n<p data-path-to-node=\"5\">Bruce spent years agonizing over <i data-path-to-node=\"5\" data-index-in-node=\"37\">Human Touch</i>, layering tracks with session pros and polishing until all of his trademark grit was gone. Then, in a burst of inspiration, he recorded <i data-path-to-node=\"5\" data-index-in-node=\"256\">Lucky Town</i> in just a few months.</p>\n<p data-path-to-node=\"5\">He didn&#8217;t just record an album, however\u2013-he found his voice.</p>\n<p data-path-to-node=\"5\">On <em>Lucky Town,</em> Springsteen traded in his anger for newfound domestic bliss. That part was new. But when we listen closely to the the album, it still sounds like Bruce: defiant and courageous, now laced with the vulnerability that first appeared in\u00a0<em>Tunnel of Love </em>and even a trace of self-mockery.</p>\n<p data-path-to-node=\"5\">Sonically, the gloss of\u00a0<em>Human Touch\u00a0</em>is gone, replaced by an almost garage-band aesthetic. Except for drums and keyboards (Roy Bittan is the only E Street Band instrumentalist on the album), Bruce plays every instrument himself.</p>\n<p data-path-to-node=\"12\">This book is a deep dive into an album about the courage to be happy, with essays drawn almost entirely from my <em>E Street Shuffle </em>blog over the years. (&#8220;Leap of Faith&#8221; is brand new and exclusive to this book.) We&#8217;ll take a close listen to each and every track, and with luck we&#8217;ll come away with a greater respect for an often overlooked and under-appreciated record.</p>\n<p data-path-to-node=\"14\">Let&#8217;s go down to <i data-path-to-node=\"14\" data-index-in-node=\"11\">Lucky Town</i>.</p>\n<p data-path-to-node=\"14\">\u00a9 February 21, 2026</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>In the long arc of Bruce Springsteen\u2019s career, 1992 is remembered as the year when the E Street Band was officially in the rearview mirror,&hellip;</p>\n", "protected": false}, "author": 1, "featured_media": 67847, "comment_status": "closed", "ping_status": "closed", "sticky": false, "template": "", "format": "standard", "meta": {"_monsterinsights_skip_tracking": false, "_monsterinsights_sitenote_active": false, "_monsterinsights_sitenote_note": "", "_monsterinsights_sitenote_category": 0, "jetpack_post_was_ever_published": false, "_jetpack_newsletter_access": "", "_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs": false, "_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id": 0, "_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content": false, "_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content": false, "footnotes": "", "jetpack_publicize_message": "", "jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled": true, "jetpack_social_post_already_shared": true, "jetpack_social_options": {"image_generator_settings": {"template": "highway", "default_image_id": 0, "font": "", "enabled": false}, "version": 2}}, "categories": [3610], "tags": [], "class_list": ["post-67846", "post", "type-post", "status-publish", "format-standard", "has-post-thumbnail", "hentry", "category-lucky"], "aioseo_notices": [], "jetpack_publicize_connections": [], "jetpack_featured_media_url": "https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/luckytown-album.webp?fit=1280%2C1278&ssl=1", "jetpack_sharing_enabled": true, "jetpack_shortlink": "https://wp.me/p9w3Lk-hEi", "jetpack_likes_enabled": true, "jetpack-related-posts": [{"id": 11843, "url": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/08/09/roll-of-the-dice-human-touch/", "url_meta": {"origin": 67846, "position": 0}, "title": "Roll of the Dice: Human Touch", "author": "Ken", "date": "August 9, 2019", "format": false, "excerpt": "It alternates between ragged and polished, it's metaphorically inconsistent, and It has brilliant lyrical subtext that vanishes halfway through.
