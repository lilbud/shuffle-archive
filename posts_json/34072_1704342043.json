It doesn&#8217;t swing like the original, but it grooves and swaggers for a good eight minutes (almost four times the length of the original), and the band seems to be having a fine time with it.</p>\n<p>As far as we know, this was a true one-off: &#8220;Chains&#8221; hasn&#8217;t turned up in Bruce&#8217;s sets before or since.</p>\n<p><strong>Chains<br />\nFirst performed:</strong>
