At risk of offending John Cale, who was also guest-starring that night on piano, I detect just a bit of the hesitancy I often hear when Bruce plays the piano, although that may simply be an artifact of the old and somewhat distant recording.</p>\n<div id=\"v-LdU0fAz4-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='426' src='https://videopress.com/embed/LdU0fAz4?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>Regardless of which instrument Bruce helmed that night, he contributed to a fierce performance and his only known one of that particular song.</p>\n<p>Bruce played three more Patti Smith originals during that late show (&#8220;Land,&#8221; &#8220;Ain&#8217;t It Strange&#8221; and &#8220;You Can Dig It&#8221;), and six at the early one.
