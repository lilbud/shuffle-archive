In the liner notes, Dave Marsh traces its origins to black stevedores in the American south who were often stiffed by ship captains who employed them but escaped without paying them.</p>\n<p>The &#8220;down&#8221; in the title/chorus means &#8220;now&#8221; &#8212; so the song is actually a demand to be paid on the spot. Because the lyrics alternate call-and-response with &#8220;Pay me my money down,&#8221; the lyrics are often misunderstood:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>I thought I heard the captain say</em><br />\n<em>Pay me my money down</em><br />\n<em>Tomorrow is our sailing day</em><br />\n<em>Pay me my money down</em></p>\n<p>The captain isn&#8217;t saying &#8220;pay me my money down.&#8221; He&#8217;s saying &#8220;tomorrow is our sailing day&#8221;&#8211; in other words, promising that he&#8217;ll still be around tomorrow to pay them but fully intending to slip off in the night. The stevedores will have none of it, of course.</p>\n<p>Given the title of the album, Bruce probably modeled his version after The Weavers&#8217; rendition. Here&#8217;s a a great 1955 recording with Pete Seeger&#8217;s prominent vocals:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"The Weavers - Pay me my money down\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/u_kDzNus__o?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>The lyrics are a bit different, of course&#8211;Bruce playfully changed the references to bosses Howard and Steven to &#8220;Mr. Gates&#8221; instead, keeping the song timely.</p>\n<p>Bruce recorded his version on March 19, 2005, and we&#8217;re fortunate enough to have a video from the session.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Pay me my money down\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jjoRj6Dr37c?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>In concert on the all-too-short Seeger Sessions Tour, &#8220;Pay Me My Money Down&#8221; was the reliable set-closer, and by the time it came around, the band was reliably loose as well. Hilarity often ensued, with the players mugging for the crowd, hamming up their solos, and refusing to leave the stage. The skits got sillier as the tour went on. Watch and see what I mean:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Pay Me My Money Down (Live at the New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival, 2006)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XiMYqDD9kXw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Pay Me My Money Down, Cincinnati 4/8/2014\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NVBqvBt7FjE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen   Padova 31 Maggio 2013   Pay me my money down\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/H9VWxV9YCF4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;Pay Me My Money Down&#8221; was also the reliable guest-star slot.

Over the course of the tour, &#8220;Pay Me&#8221; guest-stars included Roy Bittan, Nils Lofgren, Joan Baez, Southside Johnny, Joe Grushecky, Wolfgang Niedecken, Bruce&#8217;s nephew, and on TV: Conan O&#8217;Brien, Jimmy Fallon, and Thomas Haden Church.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Conan O&#039;Brien Performs with Bruce Springsteen  Pay Me My Money Down \" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/15DqZn4Qc58?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;Pay Me&#8221; is one of the few Seeger songs that Bruce refuses to leave on the shelf.
