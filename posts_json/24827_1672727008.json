Compare for yourself:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen Get that Feeling\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DQ1LfLDrDrU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Now that we&#8217;ve heard both tracks, it&#8217;s obvious that Bruce enhanced his original backing track for &#8220;Gotta Get That Feeling&#8221; for its 2010 release (it does appear to be the same track underneath) far beyond its percussion: for one thing, there&#8217;s a wonderful sax solo from Clarence\u00a0 and an entire horn section that brings the song to lush, romantic life.</p>\n<p>But that&#8217;s also the problem, because Bruce&#8217;s modern vocals are just a bit sterile for that glorious backing track. I&#8217;m not one to fault Bruce for re-recording vocals, especially when the original one isn&#8217;t quite complete; and I much prefer when he re-records the <em>entire</em> vocal rather than doing patchwork.</p>\n<p>But from its title through its lyrics, &#8220;Gotta Get That Feeling&#8221; demands a desperation and yearning that&#8217;s missing from Bruce&#8217;s 2010 vocals but very, very present in his original 1977 version. Even in the very early work-in-progress below from early August, we can hear a passion that&#8217;s absent from the officially released track. The difference is most pronounced, though, in the final verse of the official track and the outtake version above.</p>\n<div id=\"v-sQG6YdXe-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='568' src='https://videopress.com/embed/sQG6YdXe?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>Bruce may have re-recorded his vocal for the official release, but his lyrics closely match the 1977 outtake. He tightened some lines and softened some others (the original version has too much &#8220;I&#8221; and not enough &#8220;we&#8221;), but substantively the song is unchanged.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Gotta Get That Feeling&#8221; is lyrically light (the entire song only has ten unique lines), but it&#8217;s supposed to be. It&#8217;s about the best kind of romance: the kind that hasn&#8217;t quite started yet but is on the verge of it.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Yeah girl, now won&#8217;t you come on out tonight</em><br />\n<em>Yeah girl, where the stars are shining bright</em><br />\n<em>Gotta get that feeling, ye</em><em>ah we gotta get that feeling\u00a0</em><br />\n<em>Back again, y</em><em>eah back again</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Tonight, you know there&#8217;s something in the air</em><br />\n<em>Tonight, we ain&#8217;t got money but we don&#8217;t care</em><br />\n<em>Just gotta get that feeling, y</em><em>eah I wanna get that feeling</em><br />\n<em>Before the night is through </em><em>I want you to get that feeling too</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Hold me in your arms, the night will take care of us</em><br />\n<em>Come the rain or the storm love will be there with us</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Tonight, you know there&#8217;s something in the air</em><br />\n<em>Tonight, we ain&#8217;t got money but we don&#8217;t care</em><br />\n<em>We just gotta get that feeling, y</em><em>eah we gotta get that feeling\u00a0</em><br />\n<em>Back again, ye</em><em>ah back again</em></p>\n<p>With its &#8220;sha la la&#8217;s&#8221; and call-and-response chorus, &#8220;Gotta Get That Feeling&#8221; is a love letter to the girl groups of the sixties. It&#8217;s glorious and romantic, the kind of song you&#8217;re supposed to <em>feel</em> rather than just listen to.</p>\n<p>Its only sin was zigging when Bruce was in a zagging mood. Bruce was tacking toward <a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/07/05/album-companion-darkness-on-the-edge-of-town/\"><em>Darkness at the Edge of Town</em></a> at the time, and &#8220;Gotta Get That Feeling&#8221; would have worked <em>terribly</em> on that album.</p>\n<p>Thirty-three years down the road, though, Bruce was finally ready to release his might-have-been album. Serving as the second track of a double-album (immediately following the alternate arrangement of &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/10/03/roll-of-the-dice-racing-in-the-street/\">Racing in the Street</a>&#8221; that serves as the nexus between <em>Darkness</em> and <em>The Promise</em>), &#8220;Gotta Get That Feeling&#8221; opens a window into <em>The Promise\u00a0</em>and floods it with sunlight. From that point forward, <em>The Promise</em> is as bright as\u00a0<em>Darkness</em> is&#8230; well, dark.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Gotta Get That Feeling&#8221; might have made a late arrival, but it&#8217;s at least earned a trio of live performances, which is considerably more than most of the tracks on <em>The Promise</em> have seen. Only two of the three were captured for posterity, but at least they were captured in terrific quality.</p>\n<p>Bruce debuted &#8220;Gotta Get That Feeling&#8221; at his &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/12/07/where-the-band-was-asbury-park-december-7-2010-mariettas-story/\">Carousel concert</a>&#8221; in 2010, best remembered now as Clarence&#8217;s last public performance with Bruce and the E Street Band. It&#8217;s a beautifully filmed and recorded performance, but I can&#8217;t help but be a little sad during Clarence&#8217;s solo. When the Big Man stares robotically from his stool while Bruce hovers near his former foil, I&#8217;m haunted by the ghosts of their past performances when their chemistry and energy crackled and sizzled from the stage.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Gotta Get That Feeling (Live At The Carousel, Asbury Park, NJ - 2010)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/itpktRH1iig?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>The next and last time Bruce played &#8220;Gotta Get That Feeling&#8221; in public to date (the second time was at a private benefit), The Big Man was two years gone.
