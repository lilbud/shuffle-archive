From all available evidence, it seems like this is a case of Bruce landing a hook in search of a song.</p>\n<p>The earliest known recording of what would become &#8220;Jackson Cage&#8221; is just a snippet of a chorus, recorded at home in mid-1979.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen Jackson Cage #1\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dNZvi6d-_xo?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>We get perhaps a little more insight into Bruce&#8217;s original concept with this single home-recorded verse, also from 1979, but given the slower speed and more introspective tone, it&#8217;s likely from a different session.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen Jackson Cage #2\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/K4Etm2hgGFQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Bruce&#8217;s early lyrics here are interesting. Unlike the final version, where the focus is on the dual prisons of a convicted criminal and his romantic partner left to fend for herself, here Bruce focuses on the day to day experience of the prisoner himself, struggling physically, mentally, and emotionally for survival:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>You take the chances that you&#8217;ve got to take</em><br />\n<em>You drive hard and you stay awake</em><br />\n<em>You take what you can get and keep what you hold</em><br />\n<em>Pound for pound, you&#8217;re bought and sold</em><br />\n<em>You sit crying, dirty on stage</em><br />\n<em>You learn to cool your temper and collect your rage</em><br />\n<em>To use it well down in Jackson Cage</em><br />\n<em>Men down in Jackson Cage</em><br />\n<em>Down in Jackson Cage</em></p>\n<p>The quieter melody is fascinating, too&#8211;listening to the all-too-brief snippet above, one can&#8217;t help but wonder if this version of &#8220;Jackson Cage&#8221; might have ended up on\u00a0<em>Nebraska</em> had Bruce not returned to it during the River sessions a year later.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s fast forward to those 1980 recording sessions. Here we have Bruce&#8217;s next recorded attempt at &#8220;Jackson Cage,&#8221; from January. The lyrics are far more fleshed out now, and the instrumental track is fully recognizable&#8230; although not in the way you&#8217;d expect:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen  Jackson Cage\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pa1NOANOEb0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Well, that&#8217;s surprising, isn&#8217;t it?</p>\n<p>Here we have lyrics that will appear in very similar form in the final version of &#8220;Jackson Cage,&#8221; but the instrumental track is all &#8220;Restless Nights.&#8221; And those lyrics&#8211;even though they&#8217;re familiar, there&#8217;s a subtle but significant difference:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>&#8230;crossed swords on the killing floor</em><br />\n<em>To settle back is to settle without knowing</em><br />\n<em>The hard edge that you&#8217;re settling for</em><br />\n<em>There&#8217;s always just one more day</em><br />\n<em>It&#8217;ll always be that way</em><br />\n<em>Once, oh, you&#8217;re back, baby stay</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Way down, babe, in the Jackson Cage, in the Jackson Cage</em><br />\n<em>Turning tricks and kings</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Turn the corner, grab something to eat</em><br />\n<em>Turn the corner and drive down her street</em><br />\n<em>In a row of houses, she fade away</em><br />\n<em>A scene in a new play</em><br />\n<em>And girl, what&#8217;s your sin</em><br />\n<em>That you&#8217;re living in?</em><br />\n<em>You&#8217;ve been judged and handed life</em></p>\n<p>In this version, Bruce has shifted the focus away from the prisoner (who doesn&#8217;t even seem to be a factor here, although that may just be due the incomplete recording) and instead to his girl&#8211;and the lyrics that describe the prisoner&#8217;s trap in the final version instead judge the woman here for allowing herself to remain in her situation.</p>\n<p>A month later, on February 5, Bruce and the Band were in Bruce&#8217;s home studio (or more accurately, barn studio), taking a cut at the song. Once again, we have a\u00a0<em>very</em> different melody and arrangement:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen Jackson Cage #1 different music &amp; lyrics\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fDc3nsWYsXQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8230;and the lyrics seems to have taken a step backward (although since this was a band rehearsal, it&#8217;s quite possible that Bruce was just bluffing much of the song in order to focus on the band arrangement. Still, the focus here is still clearly on the girl waiting for her locked-up man, although now she doesn&#8217;t seem so trapped&#8211;she goes out dancing while the narrator/prisoner whiles his life away in jail.</p>\n<p>A second rehearsal from the same day is largely similar, but it reveals more of the lyrics (supporting the theory that Bruce was bluffing above) and interestingly the words &#8220;Jackson Cage&#8221; altogether, and the song now seems almost like a &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/?s=two+hearts\">Two Hearts</a>&#8220;-style pep talk. Take a listen:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen  Jackson Cage #2 different music &amp; lyrics\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GEApRJTtGrI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Still, even though it may seem like Bruce was pretty far afield from the song that would end up on\u00a0<em>The River</em> later that year, it didn&#8217;t take long for the song to gel from here: within a month, Bruce and the E Street Band would take a melody Bruce had tried out earlier on &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/03/29/roll-of-the-dice-take-em-as-they-come/\">Take &#8217;em as They Come</a>&#8220;&#8230;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen Take &#039;Em As They Come #2\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/n-t7wGtd4j4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8230;and record the final version we know and love today. This is the version we&#8217;ll dive into:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Jackson Cage\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mak1f7kWq2o?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Let&#8217;s start off by acknowledging the power of the instrumental track&#8211;it may have taken Bruce a while to settle on what he was aiming for, but he certainly got there in the end. Max&#8217;s rat-a-tat barrels us out of the starting gate, only to have us land with a <em>thud</em> right in the middle of what feels like an action scene. In the background, Bruce&#8217;s distant wails make us feel almost like we&#8217;ve landed at the end of &#8220;Jungleland,&#8221; with our narrator hauled off by the cherry-tops.</p>\n<p>Our narrator picks up the story from his prison cell, as he imagines the limbo his love is now imprisoned in:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Driving home she grabs something to eat</em><br />\n<em>Turns a corner and drives down her street</em><br />\n<em>Into a row of houses she just melts away</em><br />\n<em>Like the scenery in another man&#8217;s play</em><br />\n<em>Into a house where the blinds are closed</em><br />\n<em>To keep from seeing things she don&#8217;t wanna know</em><br />\n<em>She pulls the blinds and looks out on the street</em><br />\n<em>Where the cool of the night takes the edge off the heat</em></p>\n<p>Once, she was the star of her own story and the romantic lead in his. Now, she allows herself to fade into the background. Whether it&#8217;s out of loyalty to her man or her anger and fear over the violence that took him away from her, she shuts herself away inside her inconspicuous house, serving her time in a self-imposed prison.</p>\n<p>We don&#8217;t realize this at first, of course, but we do as soon as the chorus comes in:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>In the Jackson Cage</em><br />\n<em>Down in the Jackson Cage</em><br />\n<em>And you can try with all your might</em><br />\n<em>But you&#8217;re reminded every night</em><br />\n<em>That you been judged and handed life</em><br />\n<em>Down in the Jackson Cage</em></p>\n<p>Jackson is a New Jersey town about 15 miles south of Freehold, but the song could just as easily take place in Jackson, Mississippi or any other town by that name. It&#8217;s not the town that&#8217;s significant, it&#8217;s the circumstances.</p>\n<p>As the narrator sings the chorus, we get our first inkling of just how long he&#8217;s likely to be there. It seems he&#8217;s committed a capital crime, and he knows he&#8217;s never going to go back to his former life. But he&#8217;s empathetic enough to recognize that the lines apply equally to his love&#8211;that she now faces a life without him, and a dilemma over whether to move on, whether emotionally, geographically, or both.</p>\n<p>He goes on, describing their new life of biding time:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Every day ends in wasted motion</em><br />\n<em>Just crossed swords on the killing floor</em><br />\n<em>To settle back is to settle without knowing</em><br />\n<em>The hard edge that you&#8217;re settling for</em><br />\n<em>Because there&#8217;s always just one more day</em><br />\n<em>And it&#8217;s always gonna be that way</em><br />\n<em>Little girl, you&#8217;ve been down here so long</em><br />\n<em>I can tell by the way that you move you belong</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>To the Jackson Cage</em><br />\n<em>Down in Jackson Cage</em><br />\n<em>And it don&#8217;t matter just what you say</em><br />\n<em>Are you tough enough to play the game they play?</em><br />\n<em>Or will you just do your time and fade away</em><br />\n<em>Down into the Jackson Cage</em></p>\n<p>The heart of this song lies in the irony of their circumstances and the raw emotional power of the final verse: her prison is self-imposed, but his is immutable, and they both know it. The narrator can never summon the emotional bravery to say it straight out, but &#8220;Jackson Cage&#8221; is his way of exhorting her to move on, to leave him behind, to escape her prison.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Baby, there&#8217;s nights when I dream of a better world</em><br />\n<em>But I wake up so downhearted, girl</em><br />\n<em>I see you feeling so tired and confused</em><br />\n<em>I wonder what it&#8217;s worth to me or you</em><br />\n<em>Just waiting to see some sun</em><br />\n<em>Never knowing if that day will ever come</em><br />\n<em>Left alone standing out on the street</em><br />\n<em>Till you become the hand that turns the key</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Down in Jackson Cage</em><br />\n<em>Down in Jackson Cage</em><br />\n<em>Well, darlin&#8217;, can you understand</em><br />\n<em>The way that they will turn a man</em><br />\n<em>Into a stranger to waste away</em><br />\n<em>Down in the Jackson Cage</em></p>\n<p>For as much solace as she brings to him through her visits and loyalty, she increases his torment as well: in part because he can&#8217;t bear to see her tired, confused, and defeated by life, but if he&#8217;s completely honest, it&#8217;s more because he can&#8217;t bear to let her see what he knows will become of him as time passes in the cage. Better to have her move on and remember him as he was than as the stranger he will ultimately waste away to become.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s no happy ending in &#8220;Jackson Cage,&#8221; no resolution of any sort&#8211;or even an inkling of one. This is a song about prison, after all. All we can do is wonder whether at least one of them someday escapes their cage.</p>\n<p>(Ironically, though, Bruce took the opening lines of the song and repurposed them in one of his most carefree compositions, &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/11/08/roll-of-the-dice-where-the-bands-are/\">Where the Bands Are</a>.&#8221;)</p>\n<p>&#8220;Jackson Cage&#8221; made its live premiere on the first night of the River Tour in Ann Arbor. Bruce introduced it simply as a song off the new album and performed it faithfully, if a bit slowly:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"RARE Bruce Sprinsteen &quot;Jackson Cage&quot; LIVE Oct. 3, 1980 - Ann Arbor - Crisler Arena\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kNWO5eHefLU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>But a much clearer and more confident performance can be found on the concert video from Tempe just over a month later, included in\u00a0<em>The Ties That Bind: The River Collection</em>. This arrangement is virtually identical to the album, but with a guitar solo taking the place of Bruce&#8217;s harmonica from the studio version.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Jackson Cage (The River Tour, Tempe 1980)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iAft3Oy97q4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;Jackson Cage&#8221; came out most nights during the first leg of the River Tour, sporadically during the 1981 leg, and then it disappeared entirely for more than a decade. Starting with the Rising Tour, &#8220;Jackson Cage&#8221; made a few cameo appearances on each E Street Band Tour but was never a setlist staple until it became one by default during Bruce&#8217;s 2016 River Tour, where it appeared during every full album performance.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s one of those performances, from one of the very last full-album shows in Barcelona, on May 14, 2016.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Barcelona 14-05-16 - Jackson Cage (dubbed audio)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oK3icKuVnmM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Will we see &#8220;Jackson Cage&#8221; again?
