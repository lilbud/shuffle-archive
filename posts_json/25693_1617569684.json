Ten years later, though, they reunited at Pinkpop and released their first new album in more than a decade just a few months before the pandemic hit.</p>\n<p>Now, with optimism on the rise and the end of this dark tunnel growing ever closer, it seems like Krezip&#8217;s prospects are looking up as well.
