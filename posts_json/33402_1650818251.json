Turn your volume up for this first one, an awesomely crunchy roadhouse version by Mick Stender.

Lara&#8217;s &#8220;I&#8217;m on Fire&#8221; treatment emphasizes the song&#8217;s sensual side, and both studio track and moody video heighten Bruce&#8217;s impassioned lyrics.</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGNbeLwiSP0</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve got one more American artist to check out today, but we&#8217;ll have to cross the Pacific to do so. Trust me, it&#8217;s worth the trip.</p>\n<p>Tavana is a Honolulu-based singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist (guitar, banjo, lap steel, and ukelele) whose music incorporates rock, blues, and island influences. And we can definitely hear all three in his live version of &#8220;I&#8217;m on Fire&#8221; below&#8211;it&#8217;s my personal favorite among today&#8217;s collection.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Tavana &quot;I&#039;m on Fire&quot; Live at Salt\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/38D3xP0rRhk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;This song is such a great example of how Bruce can take the emotions of an average everyday man and turn it into poetry,&#8221; Tavana wrote on his Facebook page earlier this month. &#8220;I also just love the way it feels to play it on the lap steel. It brings out another layer of grit that I think is very fitting.&#8221;</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve got one more artist to check in with today, and we&#8217;ll end our tour with her in Dublin.</p>\n<p>Emmeline Gracie attracted worldwide notice when a video of her busking with James Burnell on the streets of Dublin went viral in the middle of the pandemic, racking up almost 2.5 million views to date.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Emmeline Gracie Joins James Burnell For First Time Duet Of &#039;I&#039;m on Fire&#039; (Bruce Springsteen)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TK6Ai87bkcg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>I saw that video not long after if first came out, but I opted out of spotlighting it here on the Shuffle&#8211;because as lovely as Emmeline&#8217;s vocals were, the arrangement was just a bit too traditional for what I look for in a cover.</p>\n<p>But then I stumbled across her intimate solo piano performance from earlier this year, and I was absolutely mesmerized. I think you might be, too.</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YmfhCt4ZqJI</p>\n<p>Emmmeline&#8217;s interpretation is pensive, yearning, and very, very lonely. Her performance will stick with you long after the video ends.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s it for this installment of\u00a0<em>Cover Me Round-Up</em>, but as always: there will be more. Bruce&#8217;s songs strike universal chords in musicians around the globe, and the line-up for Volume 6 is already forming.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, enjoy these six great artists, and then tell me: Which one&#8217;s <em>your</em> favorite?</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>Six more fresh takes on Bruce Springsteen&#8217;s most-covered song. </p>\n", "protected": false}, "author": 1, "featured_media": 34196, "comment_status": "open", "ping_status": "open", "sticky": false, "template": "", "format": "standard", "meta": {"_monsterinsights_skip_tracking": false, "_monsterinsights_sitenote_active": false, "_monsterinsights_sitenote_note": "", "_monsterinsights_sitenote_category": 0, "jetpack_post_was_ever_published": false, "_jetpack_newsletter_access": "", "_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs": false, "_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id": 0, "_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content": false, "_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content": false, "footnotes": "", "jetpack_publicize_message": "", "jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled": true, "jetpack_social_post_already_shared": true, "jetpack_social_options": {"image_generator_settings": {"template": "highway", "default_image_id": 0, "font": "", "enabled": false}, "version": 2}}, "categories": [4], "tags": [3466, 3467, 263, 3464, 3463, 3462, 3465], "class_list": ["post-33402", "post", "type-post", "status-publish", "format-standard", "has-post-thumbnail", "hentry", "category-cover-me", "tag-cookhouse", "tag-emmeline-gracie-rae", "tag-im-on-fire", "tag-lara-lark", "tag-leon-of-athens", "tag-mick-stender", "tag-tavana"], "aioseo_notices": [], "jetpack_publicize_connections": [], "jetpack_featured_media_url": "https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/laralark.jpg?fit=900%2C900&ssl=1", "jetpack_sharing_enabled": true, "jetpack_shortlink": "https://wp.me/p9w3Lk-8GK", "jetpack_likes_enabled": true, "jetpack-related-posts": [{"id": 25178, "url": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/03/05/cover-me-round-up-im-on-fire/", "url_meta": {"origin": 33402, "position": 0}, "title": "Cover Me Round-Up: I&#8217;m on Fire", "author": "Ken", "date": "March 5, 2021", "format": false, "excerpt": "Presenting the first in an occasional catch-up/round-up of terrific \"I'm on Fire\" covers.", "rel": "", "context": "In &quot;Cover Me&quot;", "block_context": {"text": "Cover Me", "link": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/category/cover-me/"}, "img": {"alt_text": "", "src": "https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/mainline.jpg?fit=1200%2C675&ssl=1&resize=350%2C200", "width": 350, "height": 200, "srcset": "https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/mainline.jpg?fit=1200%2C675&ssl=1&resize=350%2C200 1x, https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/mainline.jpg?fit=1200%2C675&ssl=1&resize=525%2C300 1.5x, https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/mainline.jpg?fit=1200%2C675&ssl=1&resize=700%2C400 2x, https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/mainline.jpg?fit=1200%2C675&ssl=1&resize=1050%2C600 3x"}, "classes": []}, {"id": 32244, "url": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/01/27/cover-me-round-up-im-on-fire-part-4/", "url_meta": {"origin": 33402, "position": 1}, "title": "Cover Me Round-Up: I&#8217;m on Fire (Part 4)", "author": "Ken", "date": "January 27, 2022", "format": false, "excerpt": "Five more fresh takes on Bruce's steamy hit single.", "rel": "", "context": "In &quot;Cover Me&quot;", "block_context": {"text": "Cover Me", "link": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/category/cover-me/"}, "img": {"alt_text": "", "src": "https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/little.jpg?fit=1200%2C675&ssl=1&resize=350%2C200", "width": 350, "height": 200, "srcset": "https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/little.jpg?fit=1200%2C675&ssl=1&resize=350%2C200 1x, https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/little.jpg?fit=1200%2C675&ssl=1&resize=525%2C300 1.5x, https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/little.jpg?fit=1200%2C675&ssl=1&resize=700%2C400 2x, https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/little.jpg?fit=1200%2C675&ssl=1&resize=1050%2C600 3x"}, "classes": []}, {"id": 29309, "url": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/09/27/cover-me-round-up-im-on-fire-part-2/", "url_meta": {"origin": 33402, "position": 2}, "title": "Cover Me Round-Up: I&#8217;m on Fire (Part 2)", "author": "Ken", "date": "September 27, 2021", "format": false, "excerpt": "It's time for another trip around the world.
