But this was one take. So it means more to me than just the lyrics.

But Ronnie Spector was no lesser singer, and the background thunderclaps only served to heighten her powerful vocals rather than dampen them.</p>\n<p>The song went on to win a Grammy (for Best Sound Effects), and\u00a0<em>Rolling Stone</em> enshrined it as one of their 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"758\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PbSQf9RkVSU?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></div>\n<p>That terrific clip above was from 1973. Almost a decade had already gone by since that last big hit single crested on the charts, and within a year, Ronnie left her abusive husband, who did his best to prevent his ex-wife from ever again attaining mainstream success.</p>\n<p>Enter Bruce Springsteen and Steven Van Zandt.</p>\n<p>Actually, first enter John Lennon, who ran into Ronnie in New York one day and insisted on introducing her to Jimmy Iovine, who in turn invited Ronnie to join him for a Southside Johnny studio session. That&#8217;s where Ronnie met Bruce and Stevie.</p>\n<p>Bruce was so taken with Ronnie that he insisted that she sing \u201cYou Mean So Much to Me\u201d with Southside on his album. That was the start of both a long friendship and professional relationship. The E Street Band (led by Stevie) would back Ronnie on her \u201cSay Goodbye to Hollywood\u201d single (with Steven&#8217;s \u201cBaby, Please Don\u2019t Go\u201d for the b-side), and Ronnie herself would grace Bruce\u2019s stage several times, as recently as December 2016.</p>\n<p>Her most memorable E Street stage appearance may have been the evening of November 4, 1976, when she fronted the E Street Band for a mini-set of Ronettes classics, including her beautiful, soaring take on &#8220;Walking in the Rain,&#8221; her first of five performances of that song with Bruce and the band over the coming months.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"758\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0wRNLYykgBk?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></div>\n<p>&#8220;What Bruce and Steven did (along with Johnny),&#8221; Ronnie told <em>Mojo, &#8220;</em> was give me an opportunity to get out and sing on the road with a rock band and that was important to me then. My ex-husband was trying to break me and working with those guys saved me. They looked out for me, they wanted me to know I meant something to them and to music.&#8221;</p>\n<p>They weren&#8217;t alone. Ronnie Spector passed away this evening (as I write this) after losing her battle with cancer. If there&#8217;s an Internet in the afterlife, perhaps she&#8217;ll see the tributes pouring in from around the globe and realize how much she meant to a world touched by her inimitable voice.</p>\n<p><strong>Ronnie Spector</strong><br />\n<strong>August 10, 1943 &#8211; January 12, 2022</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Walking in the Rain<br />\nFirst performed:</strong> November 4, 1976 (New York City, NY)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> May 13, 1977 (Red Bank, NJ)</p>\n<p>\u00a9January 13, 2022</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>Ronnie Spector (August 10, 1943 &#8211; January 12, 2022) \u2013 one of the greatest voices to ever grace the E Street stage. </p>\n", "protected": false}, "author": 1, "featured_media": 67920, "comment_status": "open", "ping_status": "open", "sticky": false, "template": "", "format": "standard", "meta": {"_monsterinsights_skip_tracking": false, "_monsterinsights_sitenote_active": false, "_monsterinsights_sitenote_note": "", "_monsterinsights_sitenote_category": 0, "jetpack_post_was_ever_published": false, "_jetpack_newsletter_access": "", "_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs": false, "_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id": 0, "_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content": false, "_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content": false, "footnotes": "", "jetpack_publicize_message": "", "jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled": true, "jetpack_social_post_already_shared": true, "jetpack_social_options": {"image_generator_settings": {"template": "highway", "default_image_id": 0, "font": "", "enabled": false}, "version": 2}}, "categories": [4, 3612, 5], "tags": [306, 3386], "class_list": ["post-32316", "post", "type-post", "status-publish", "format-standard", "has-post-thumbnail", "hentry", "category-cover-me", "category-great", "category-meeting-across-the-river", "tag-ronnie-spector", "tag-walking-in-the-rain"], "aioseo_notices": [], "jetpack_publicize_connections": [], "jetpack_featured_media_url": "https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/walkingrain-1.jpg?fit=1200%2C1202&ssl=1", "jetpack_sharing_enabled": true, "jetpack_shortlink": "https://wp.me/p9w3Lk-8pe", "jetpack_likes_enabled": true, "jetpack-related-posts": [{"id": 55960, "url": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2025/02/17/kingdom-of-days-february-17-2/", "url_meta": {"origin": 32316, "position": 0}, "title": "February 17", "author": "Ken", "date": "February 17, 2025", "format": false, "excerpt": "On this date: Bruce meets Nils for the first time and plays with Ronnie Spector and Flo and Eddie.", "rel": "", "context": "In &quot;Kingdom of Days&quot;", "block_context": {"text": "Kingdom of Days", "link": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/category/kingdom-of-days/"}, "img": {"alt_text": "", "src": "https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/spector.jpg?fit=762%2C509&ssl=1&resize=350%2C200", "width": 350, "height": 200, "srcset": "https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/spector.jpg?fit=762%2C509&ssl=1&resize=350%2C200 1x, https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/spector.jpg?fit=762%2C509&ssl=1&resize=525%2C300 1.5x, https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/spector.jpg?fit=762%2C509&ssl=1&resize=700%2C400 2x"}, "classes": []}, {"id": 12011, "url": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/08/27/matr-ronnie-spector-and-the-e-street-band-say-goodbye-to-hollywood/", "url_meta": {"origin": 32316, "position": 1}, "title": "MatR: Ronnie Spector and The E Street Band, Say Goodbye to Hollywood", "author": "Ken", "date": "August 27, 2019", "format": false, "excerpt": "The E Street Band finally gets an official recording credit in 1977 when Steve Van Zandt recruits them to back Ronnie Spector in the studio.
