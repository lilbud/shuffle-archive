Bruce and Steve happened to be there as well, and both were over the moon to be in the presence of one of their favorite voices.</p>\n<p>Bruce was so taken with Ronnie that he insisted that she sing &#8220;You Mean So Much to Me&#8221; with Southside on his album&#8211;he thought her voice was a perfect fit for it. That was the start of both a long friendship and a professional relationship: the E Street Band (led by Steve) would back Ronnie on her &#8220;Say Goodbye to Hollywood&#8221; single, Steve wrote a song (&#8220;Baby, Please Don&#8217;t Go&#8221;) for the b-side, and Ronnie herself would grace Bruce&#8217;s stage several times, as recently as December 2016.</p>\n<p>This recording of &#8220;Baby, I Love You&#8221; is from Ronnie&#8217;s very first on-stage performance with Bruce and the E Street Band, on November 4, 1976 at the Palladium in New York City.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"758\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jdWqZ3U-e68?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></div>\n<p><strong>Baby, I Love You</strong><br />\n<strong>First performed:\u00a0</strong>November 4, 1976 (New York City, NY)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:\u00a0</strong>May 13, 1977\u00a0(Red Bank, NJ)</p>\n<p>\u00a9 September 2, 2018</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>When Ronnie met Bruce: the iconic 60s singer would collaborate with Bruce and the E Street Band several times, both on stage and on vinyl.
