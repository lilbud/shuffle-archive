Good.

One wonders if Bruce was already at work compiling this collection when he wrote that song.)</p>\n<p>From here, the songs diverge, although the general plot remains the same. In &#8220;Fugitive&#8217;s Dream (Ballad),&#8221; the earliest (and in my opinion the best) version, our narrator comes very close to an action he wouldn&#8217;t be able to walk away from.\u00a0 In &#8220;Unsatisfied Heart,&#8221; it&#8217;s implied that that he literally did walk away.</p>\n<p>But here in &#8220;Fugitive&#8217;s Dream,&#8221; Joe is simply haunted by his past, unable to shake a memory (or is it an urge?) once awakened.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I allowed him into my home on his vow our secret would never see the light</em><br />\n<em>At night I&#8217;d lay awake in my wife&#8217;s arms, she sighed, &#8220;Joe, are you alright?&#8221;</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I thought I could hold on, my vows I tried to keep</em><br />\n<em>Day after day I felt myself grow weak</em><br />\n<em>One night I dressed by moonlight and kissed my wife on the cheek</em><br />\n<em>And I fled into the darkness of Union Street</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>And night after night the same dream keeps coming &#8217;round</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;m standing high in the green hills on the outskirts of town</em><br />\n<em>The night air fills my lungs and rustles my shirt</em><br />\n<em>In the distance I can see the building where I used to work</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I break through the open fields and out onto Old Town Road</em><br />\n<em>I run faster and faster &#8217;til I feel like my chest will explode</em><br />\n<em>As I draw near the town&#8217;s lit by a red summer moon</em><br />\n<em>I feel your arms around me, I wake up in this room</em></p>\n<p>Although this version lacks the moment of intimacy between Joe and his houseguest that heightens &#8220;Fugitive&#8217;s Dream (Ballad),&#8221; Bruce uses the word &#8220;vows&#8221; in a different context here that strongly implies he&#8217;s referring to marital ones.</p>\n<p>We follow a slightly different path, but it still leads to a moment of weakness and the darkness of Union Street. Whether he&#8217;s fleeing from his own self-awareness or seeking a community of similarly oriented men, our narrator is forever after haunted in his dreams, chased by the lie he&#8217;s living (in a couplet too similar to the dream sequence in &#8220;Downbound Train&#8221; to be a coincidence).</p>\n<p>The title &#8220;Fugitive&#8217;s Dream&#8221; conditions us to expect a more black-and-white crime fiction. What we witness instead is a man on the run from himself.</p>\n<p><strong>Fugitive&#8217;s Dream<br />\nRecorded:</strong> March 24, 1983<br />\n<strong>Released:\u00a0</strong><em>L.A.
