(Unfortunately, no audio of any Earth gig circulates to confirm.)</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Cream - Sitting On Top Of The World\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QyyFHmNtwIU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>But we do have one recording of Bruce performing it with his eponymous band in February 1972 during their month-long residency at The Back Door in Richmond, Virginia.</p>\n<p>And as sacrilegious as it may be to say: I think Bruce&#8217;s version smokes all the others. Every band member is dialed in with just the slightest restraint so as to never break the mood. The pacing is perfect, Bruce&#8217;s vocals are soulful, and (of course) Sancious dazzles during his solo.</p>\n<p>But oh, that wailing guitar solo finish by 22-year-old Bruce&#8230; those final two minutes rank among my favorite &#8220;Pre-Street&#8221; moments on record.</p>\n<div id=\"v-iKPVOvfb-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='568' src='https://videopress.com/embed/iKPVOvfb?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>If you&#8217;re not already duly impressed by that performance, then consider this: just two months later, Bruce was already writing and recording the songs that would appear not long after on\u00a0<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2023/01/05/album-companion-greetings-from-asbury-park-n-j/\"><em>Greetings From Asbury Park, N.J</em>.</a></p>\n<p>The Bruce Springsteen Band era has such a distinctly different sound than that of the E Street Band that it&#8217;s easy to assume they were separated by years.</p>\n<p>But it was only a matter of weeks between those smoky Back Door performances and the creation of Springsteen originals like &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/10/21/roll-of-the-dice-its-hard-to-be-a-saint-in-the-city/\">It&#8217;s Hard to Be a Saint in the City</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/12/28/roll-of-the-dice-if-i-was-the-priest/\">If I Was the Priest</a>&#8221; that we know and love today.</p>\n<p><strong>Sitting on Top of the World<br />\nFirst performed:</strong> February 4, 1972 (Richmond, VA)*<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> February 4, 1972 (Richmond, VA)</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">*While the above recording definitely originated at Bruce&#8217;s February 1972 stand at The Back Door, there&#8217;s good reason to believe it may be from a night other than the one officially cited.
