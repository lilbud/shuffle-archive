It&#8217;s reminiscent of iconic songs like &#8220;Rock Around the Clock&#8221; and other songs that lit up the charts, yet it never charted for Mullican. It&#8217;s hard not to conclude that his age had something to do with it: rock was music for the young, and it must have seemed at least a little odd to hear the elder Mullican sing of &#8220;rocking&#8221; with a different girl every night of the week.</p>\n<p>That didn&#8217;t stop a score of artists from covering it in later years though. Notable versions included Nick Lowe&#8217;s cover in 1985 and a 2012 rendition by The Connection that was anointed &#8220;Coolest Song in the World&#8221; by Little Steven.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"The CONNECTION - &quot;Seven Nights To Rock&quot; ( Official )\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TDriok3B38A?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Bruce Springsteen covered it, too&#8211;more than one hundred times, in fact.
