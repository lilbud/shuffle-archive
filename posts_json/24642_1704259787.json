The phrase &#8220;a thousand guitars&#8221; appears in &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/08/01/roll-of-the-dice-radio-nowhere/\">Radio Nowhere</a>&#8221; on his 2007 <em>Magic</em> album, and it means there what it means here. And as for the house metaphor, he embraced that nightly on the Working on a Dream Tour in 2009.</p>\n<div id=\"v-SYlzK66k-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='428' src='https://videopress.com/embed/SYlzK66k?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>The house metaphor didn&#8217;t originate with Bruce; he&#8217;s cited the gospel standard &#8220;I&#8217;m Working on a Building&#8221; as his inspiration for the idea.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"The Carter Family - I&#039;m Working on a Building (1934 Studio Version)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eSMR7EiYbQM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>That notion of visualizing one&#8217;s life as a building&#8211;an act of long-term, painstaking construction&#8211;both appealed to and fascinated Bruce (along with a score of other artists who covered &#8220;I&#8217;m Working on a Building,&#8221; including Bruce&#8217;s heroes Elvis Presley and John Fogerty).</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s no coincidence that Bruce&#8217;s &#8220;house&#8221; rap began on the Working on a Dream Tour and lasted throughout it: <em>Working on a Dream</em> was the first album in which Bruce grappled with aging, the first of a thematic trilogy that includes <em>Western Stars</em> and <em>Letter to You</em>.</p>\n<p>In <em>Working on a Dream</em>, Bruce took stock of his life and work and asked himself: What have I built? And how close am I to being finished?</p>\n<p>His answer was something that transcended a catalog and a career.\u00a0He&#8217;d built a house, a single-family dwelling, and that family was\u00a0<em>big</em>.</p>\n<p>His family included his band, and it included his fans, united as a community not just by music and lyrics but by the values they conveyed and celebrated.\u00a0 Honor, fun, and joy. Love, liberty, and fraternity.</p>\n<p>And that house wasn&#8217;t even close to being done.</p>\n<p>Looking back on it now, it&#8217;s easy to see, hear, and <em>feel</em> the impact of that self-realization. From 2009 forward, Bruce&#8217;s shows became ever more communal, with more requests and even more audience interaction. Bruce knew he was creating a place of idealized community, and that his best way to influence the world beyond the arena was to model it inside the arena.</p>\n<p>More astutely than any scholar or critic, &#8220;House of a Thousand Guitars&#8221; explains why Bruce has become not just an American icon but also an American symbol.</p>\n<p>Speaking of symbolism, let&#8217;s look at those lyrics:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>The blood moon shines across the vale</em><br />\n<em>Bells ring out through churches and jails</em><br />\n<em>I tally my wounds and count the scars</em><br />\n<em>Here in the house of a thousand guitars</em></p>\n<p>Bruce wastes no time&#8211;his first symbolic image is immediate. The blood moon is generally considered to be an omen of endings. Or more precisely, the <em>beginning</em> of the end. The appearance of the blood moon at the beginning of the song is Bruce&#8217;s way of telling us that he considers himself at the beginning of the end of his journey.</p>\n<p>In the second line, Bruce references the churches and jails, and that&#8217;s neither a coincidence nor a convenient rhyme. (My guess is that Bruce chose &#8220;vale&#8221; as the rhyme for &#8220;jail&#8221; rather than the other way around.) This is almost certainly an intentional callback to his early classic, &#8220;Jungleland,&#8221; and it tells us that Bruce has set his narrative within the inner world of his art&#8211;his house of a thousand guitars.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>The criminal clown has stolen the throne</em><br />\n<em>He steals what he can never own</em><br />\n<em>May the truth ring out from every small town bar</em><br />\n<em>We&#8217;ll light up the house of a thousand guitars</em></p>\n<p>In almost every review I&#8217;ve read of\u00a0<em>Letter to You</em>, that one line in this one song gets specifically cited. You know the one&#8211;I don&#8217;t even have to call it out. But in quoting the line out of context, I think many critics miss the point: &#8220;House of a Thousand Guitars&#8221; isn&#8217;t an anti-Trump screed; it&#8217;s an affirmation of America&#8217;s enduring societal values and their stubborn resistance to assault&#8211;even from within the government.</p>\n<p>Every night in the house of a thousand guitars, there&#8217;s a rededication through art, connection and community. And when Bruce calls for the truth to ring out from every small town bar, he recognizes that while he may build his community in an arena, his house is much bigger than any physical edifice.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well it&#8217;s alright yeah it&#8217;s alright</em><br />\n<em>Meet me darling come Saturday night</em><br />\n<em>All good souls from near and far</em><br />\n<em>Will meet in the house of a thousand guitars</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Here the bitter and the bored</em><br />\n<em>Wake in search of the lost chord</em><br />\n<em>That&#8217;ll band us together for as long as there&#8217;s stars</em><br />\n<em>Yeah in the house of a thousand guitars</em></p>\n<p>Bruce gets his complete message across in the first half of the song; the remainder is just reinforcement.\u00a0But this verse above&#8211;&#8220;the bitter and the bored&#8221;&#8211;is the heart of the song.</p>\n<p>We may come to the house because we&#8217;re disaffected; we may come purely to be entertained. But we keep coming back because in that house we <em>feel</em> that lost chord even if we can&#8217;t name it, let alone play it. Whatever our differences, in that room we have solidarity.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well it&#8217;s alright yeah it&#8217;s alright</em><br />\n<em>Meet me darling come Saturday night</em><br />\n<em>Brother and sister wherever you are</em><br />\n<em>We&#8217;ll meet in the house of a thousand guitars</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>So wake and shake off your troubles my friend</em><br />\n<em>We&#8217;ll go where the music never ends</em><br />\n<em>From the stadiums to the small town bars</em><br />\n<em>We&#8217;ll light up the house of a thousand guitars</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>House of a thousand guitars, house of a thousand guitars</em><br />\n<em>Brother and sister wherever you are</em><br />\n<em>We&#8217;ll rise together till we fire the spark</em><br />\n<em>That&#8217;ll light up the house of a thousand guitars</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well it&#8217;s alright yeah it&#8217;s alright</em><br />\n<em>Meet me darling come Saturday night</em><br />\n<em>All good souls from near and far</em><br />\n<em>We&#8217;ll meet in the house of a thousand guitars</em></p>\n<p>Bruce considers &#8220;House of a Thousand Guitars&#8221; one of his very best songs, and it&#8217;s easy to understand why. It&#8217;s simultaneously a satisfied reflection on his life&#8217;s work, a testament to the uniting power of music in general, and a stubbornly optimistic outlook on a more-than-ever divided country.</p>\n<p>But he&#8217;s hinted at an even deeper and somewhat oblique resonance. In the film version of <em>Letter to You</em>, he says &#8220;We&#8217;ve not been made perfect by god, but [in this house] I try to speak in the voice of my better angels.&#8221; And at the very moment he says this, the on-screen images shift the context from his musical family to his biological one.\u00a0<em>I may still struggle with my demons,</em> he seems to say,<em> but at least in these two houses I keep them at bay. </em></p>\n<p>I&#8217;m too far invested in Bruce&#8217;s life story and body of work to be able to evaluate how well &#8220;House of a Thousand Guitars&#8221; would resonate with someone unfamiliar with its singer, but I suspect that this is a song that rewards devoted fans much more than it does casual listeners.</p>\n<p>A deep cut in every sense, &#8220;House of a Thousand Guitars&#8221; is the letter in\u00a0<em>Letter to You</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Bonus:\u00a0</strong>For a song purportedly written in celebration of his band, it&#8217;s ironic that Bruce&#8217;s first public performance of &#8220;House of a Thousand Guitars&#8221; was an acoustic husband-and-wife duet, at the annual Stand Up For Heroes benefit in late 2020. It was a perfect selection, though: their stripped-down arrangement revealed a more universally resonant song that celebrates the heroic sacrifices and resilience of those who defend the ideals of a nation struggling to live up to them.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"House of a Thousand Guitars - Bruce Springsteen and Patti Scialfa (Stand Up for Heroes 2020)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/z27MexwKxT4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><strong>Bonus #2 (Updated 1/2/2024):\u00a0</strong>&#8220;House of a Thousand Guitars&#8221; seemed a lock for the E Street Band&#8217;s first post-pandemic tour, but surprisingly Bruce dropped it after only outings.
