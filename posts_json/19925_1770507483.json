But beyond those, we&#8217;ve got to dig a bit deeper to unearth Bruce&#8217;s hidden Beatles gems.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s one of them, from more than three decades ago.</p>\n<p>On the evening of August 11, 1989, Ringo Starr brought his All-Starr Band to the Garden State Arts Center in Holmdel, New Jersey.</p>\n<p>This was the original incarnation of Ringo&#8217;s All-Starr Band, and a true all-star line-up it was: Dr. John was in the band back then, as was Levon Helm and Billy Preston. And since Bruce wasn&#8217;t on tour, Ringo seized the opportunity to hire Nils Lofgren and Clarence Clemons, too.</p>\n<p>With two E Streeters in the band at a New Jersey show, odds were pretty good that Bruce might make an appearance. But who could have predicted that Bruce would join the band for not one but <em>five </em>songs, including two one-time-only Beatles covers?</p>\n<p>The first song the truly All-Starr Band\u00a0 tackled was a debut, which is actually surprising: with Billy Preston in the band, we&#8217;d expect the set list to include the first Beatles song to credit an additional artist.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Get Back&#8221; was released by The Beatles with Billy Preston in April 1969, and it immediately added another notch to The Beatles already long list of #1 singles&#8211;in fact, &#8220;Get Back&#8221; was the single that tied The Beatles with Elvis for the most #1 singles, each with seventeen.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"758\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IKJqecxswCA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></div>\n<p>Still, before Bruce walked on stage that night, Ringo and his band hadn&#8217;t ever performed &#8220;Get Back&#8221; live. Whatever prompted its inclusion that night, it was an inspired choice. Bruce took a lead turn on both vocals and guitar, taking a spotlight moment mid-song for a guitar solo.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"758\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OK-lSq3vVZ0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></div>\n<p>For those fortunate enough to have been there, it was a special night, and not just for the historic team-up. No one knew it at the time, but that performance would turn out to be Bruce&#8217;s final public performance with members of the E Street Band before they went their separate ways that autumn.</p>\n<p><strong>Get Back<br />\nFirst performed:</strong> August 11, 1989 (Holmdel, NJ)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> August 11, 1989 (Holmdel, NJ)</p>\n<p>\u00a9 July 22,
