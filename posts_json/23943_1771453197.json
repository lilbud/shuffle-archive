If only.</p>\n<p>Everyone knows the story: At the height of her popularity, Donna Summer asked Bruce to write her a song, and not even three weeks after recording his famed <em>Nebraska\u00a0</em>demo tape, Bruce wrote &#8220;Cover Me&#8221; for the disco queen.</p>\n<p>In a &#8220;Hungry Heart&#8221; replay, Jon Landau sensed a hit record in &#8220;Cover Me&#8221; and urged Bruce to reconsider. Against his better judgment, Bruce wrote &#8220;Protection&#8221; (the thematic inverse of &#8220;Cover Me&#8221;) just a couple of weeks later and gave it to Summer instead of &#8220;Cover Me.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Personally, I think &#8220;Cover Me&#8221; would have been a much stronger track performed by Summer, but hey&#8211;what do I know? &#8220;Protection&#8221; earned Summer a Grammy nomination, and &#8220;Cover Me&#8221; became Bruce&#8217;s third career Top Ten single. Landau obviously knew what he was doing.</p>\n<p>The problem is: Bruce did, too. &#8220;Cover Me&#8221; was written for another artist to record, and so it sounds like that, too. In the hands of the E Street Band, &#8220;Cover Me&#8221; rocks, but it&#8217;s not supposed to. &#8220;Cover Me&#8221; should be a lot lighter on its feet than it is. When forced to listen to it, I sense a disco hit struggling to break free of the rock and roll band that keeps it anchored in place.</p>\n<p>Okay, enough tangents. Although I&#8217;ve dreaded this moment, it&#8217;s time to take a close listen to &#8220;Cover Me.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t make me do it alone, okay?</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"758\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/s3tqIk8TPWM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></div>\n<p>Why does this song elicit such a visceral reaction from me?</p>\n<p>Well, it&#8217;s not the lyrics. I mean, they&#8217;re not particularly profound, but they&#8217;re serviceable. In fact, similar to the lesson I relearned when I wrote about &#8220;Letter to You&#8221; recently, there&#8217;s an argument to be made for &#8220;Cover Me&#8221; being a decent pop song if only it was set to a different backing track and arrangement.</p>\n<p>In fact, Bruce himself made that argument implicitly, when he recast &#8220;Cover Me&#8221; almost a year and a half after he recorded it, as the unreleased outtake &#8220;Drop On Down and Cover Me.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"758\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4iQh-UzJiH4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></div>\n<p>&#8220;Drop on Down and Cover Me&#8221; is so far superior to &#8220;Cover Me&#8221; in every way that I am to this day mystified as to what made Bruce revert to the earlier version instead. Heck, even the guitar solo (the sole redeeming feature of &#8220;Cover Me&#8221;) is stronger in &#8220;Drop on Down and Cover Me.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In either form, however, Bruce&#8217;s lyrics are inoffensively slight, revolving around a single gimmick: the use of wartime metaphor in what is otherwise a straightforward pop song about taking refuge from a harsh world in a nameless lover&#8217;s arms.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>The times are tough now, just getting tougher</em><br />\n<em>This old world is rough, it&#8217;s just getting rougher</em><br />\n<em>Cover me, come on baby cover me</em><br />\n<em>Well I&#8217;m looking for a lover who will come on in and cover me</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Now promise me baby you won&#8217;t let them find us</em><br />\n<em>Hold me in your arms, let&#8217;s let our love blind us</em><br />\n<em>Cover me, shut the door and cover me</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;m looking for a lover who will come on in and cover me</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Outside&#8217;s the rain, the driving snow</em><br />\n<em>I can hear the wild wind blowing</em><br />\n<em>Turn out the light, bolt the door</em><br />\n<em>I ain&#8217;t going out there no more</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>This whole world is out there just trying to score</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;ve seen enough, I don&#8217;t wanna see any more</em><br />\n<em>Cover me, come on and cover me</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;m looking for a lover who will come on in and cover me</em></p>\n<p>I called &#8220;Cover Me&#8221; lyrically slight for a reason: aside from the repeated chorus, the song consists of a grand total of ten unique lines, the first two of which are awfully lazy, and the last two of which are basically restatements of the first two. (The rest isn&#8217;t particularly ambitious, either.)</p>\n<p>Interestingly, even though the verses are essentially identical between &#8220;Cover Me&#8221; and &#8220;Drop on Down and Cover Me,&#8221; Bruce rewrote the bridge for the later song:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Inside I feel the pain that</em><br />\n<em>The hatred and the sorrow</em><br />\n<em>I wanna shut the light, baby</em><br />\n<em>C&#8217;mon and shut the door</em><br />\n<em>Drop on down and cover me</em></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a moment of vulnerability for the narrator&#8211;he drops the metaphor just long enough for us to feel his inner pain and turmoil, and I think the song is stronger for it.</p>\n<p>But even the stronger bridge can&#8217;t rescue the overall message of the song, which is: the world sucks, so let&#8217;s have sex.</p>\n<p>It would be one thing if the narrator was trying to mute the effects of a specific tragedy, or if he was addressing a specific person. Bruce did that with &#8220;The Fuse&#8221; (which is basically the same song as &#8220;Cover Me&#8221; thematically) two decades later to much more powerful and artistic effect.</p>\n<p>But in &#8220;Cover Me,&#8221; the narrator doesn&#8217;t seem to be set off by anything in particular, nor does he seem to care who he hooks up with: he&#8217;s looking for a lover who will cover him, and there&#8217;s no indication that he&#8217;s talking to anyone specifically.</p>\n<p>But if the problem with &#8220;Cover Me&#8221; were only its lyrics, the song would be forgettable rather than terrible. No, the true problem with &#8220;Cover Me&#8221; is the backing track.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s just awkward.</p>\n<p>Like, <em>really</em> awkward.</p>\n<p>Bruce&#8217;s smoking guitar solo distracts for the first few seconds out of the gate, but as soon as the first verse kicks in, so do the cringes. The E Street Band has grown tremendously in versatility over the years but in 1982, they were ill-suited for a song that clearly cries out for a disco beat. Bruce does his best to save it with his lead guitar (and Garry is particularly and impressively active throughout), but it&#8217;s not enough to be convincing.</p>\n<p>Lacking any substantive lyrics to distract from or elevate the backing track, &#8220;Cover Me&#8221; doesn&#8217;t so much rock as plod&#8211;which may be what motivated Bruce to commission DJ/producer Arthur Baker to remix &#8220;Cover Me&#8221; (along with &#8220;Born in the U.S.A.&#8221; and &#8220;Dancing in the Dark.&#8221;)</p>\n<p>&#8220;Cover Me&#8221; proved a much bigger challenge than the other two singles, though, and Baker did much more than remix the song. He swapped out Garry&#8217;s bassline for a new one by Brian Rock, and he added a new background vocal track by Jocelyn Brown.</p>\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t enough. After a rough opening, Baker finds his footing for a couple of minutes, but it quickly goes off the rails at around the 2:40 mark and becomes almost a parody of an 80s dance song.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"758\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/G_TZnp6AZaY?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></div>\n<p>Baker&#8217;s &#8220;Undercover&#8221; mix was accompanied by two shorter &#8220;dub&#8221; mixes.

And yet, it was a bona fide hit, peaking at #7 in the summer of 1984, the second of a record-tying string of seven Top Ten singles from a single album. Only Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson, and Drake have ever equaled that feat. (Strangely, though, for the peak era of MTV, Bruce never filmed a video for &#8220;Cover Me.&#8221;)</p>\n<p>So naturally, Bruce kept &#8220;Cover Me&#8221; in his set lists throughout the Born in the U.S.A. Tour, prefixing it with an ominous introduction that only served to raise expectations before dashing them. (Bruce&#8217;s guitar solo worked pretty well live, though.)</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"758\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/betZWo0gZrc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></div>\n<p>&#8220;Cover Me&#8221; stuck around on the next tour, too. On the Tunnel of Love Express Tour, Bruce gave Patti one of her first spotlight moments with a Martha Reeves-inspired intro, and the horn section made the riff sound slightly less dated. Otherwise, though, the arrangement was the same.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"758\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/O0zH44ofACI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></div>\n<p>Bruce kept &#8220;Cover Me&#8221; in heavy rotation through one last tour in 1992, and I actually think it fared somewhat better in the hands of his new touring band.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"758\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZGmUQEQy1gs?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></div>\n<p>But as the 1980s faded further and firmly into the rearview mirror, &#8220;Cover Me&#8221; thankfully became a rarity, making only a handful of appearances per tour from the Magic Tour forward.\u00a0 (Maddeningly, I seemed to have a knack for catching them.)</p>\n<p>Credit Bruce for always playing it straight, at least.
