was recorded in early 1973 during the Wild and Innocent sessions and was originally intended for inclusion on that album. It didn&#8217;t make the cut, but it did make a 1974 UK promotional acetate, and from there into the land of bootleggers, where &#8220;Santa Ana&#8221; roamed free until a later take was released officially as part of the <em>Tracks</em> box set in 1998.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s interesting to compare the bootleg version with the released version from\u00a0<em>Tracks.\u00a0</em>The official version (at the top of this post) is a rare snapshot of the early E Street Band, including backing vocals from Suki Lahav, and David Sancious on piano.</p>\n<p>The bootleg version&#8211;an earlier take of the song&#8211;uses the same vocal performance with a pared-down instrumental accompaniment. It&#8217;s simpler, looser, and features a prominent performance by Clarence Clemons&#8211;on the flute! (Clarence&#8217;s contribution would be dropped from the released track.)</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN - Hey Santa Ana (remastered audio, &#039;71)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tRjpRM4rVgQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>In concert, &#8220;Santa Ana&#8221; has been performed very few times&#8211;that we know of.

As there are many early gigs without recorded setlists, it&#8217;s entirely possible he&#8217;s right, but Bruce is also known to have a fuzzy memory about the history of his more obscure songs (as illustrated below, when &#8220;Santa Ana&#8221; returned to the stage after a 32-year absence).</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Santa Ana (solo piano) Bruce Springsteen 11/9/2005 Philly\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/weWzFj8sPBQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Bruce rescued &#8220;Santa Ana&#8221; from obscurity in 2005 for five performances, and then promptly returned it from whence it came.
