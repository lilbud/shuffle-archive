While the lyrics were still largely the same, Bruce stripped out the paranoid urgency, dialed up the tenderness, and set it all against one of his best mid-eighties backing tracks (a melody so good, in fact, that he&#8217;d nick it a couple of weeks later for &#8220;Janey, Don&#8217;t You Lose Heart&#8221;).</p>\n<p>The result: &#8220;Drop on Down and Cover Me,&#8221; which I&#8217;d rank at or very near the top of the still-missing-in-action outtakes crying out for an official release.</p>\n<p>Take a listen:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"758\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4iQh-UzJiH4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></div>\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure there&#8217;s a better example of how subtle changes can dramatically alter a song than &#8220;Drop on Down and Cover Me.&#8221; The lyrics undoubtedly sound very familiar&#8211;most of them are virtually identical.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Times are tough there baby</em><br />\n<em>It&#8217;s getting tougher now</em><br />\n<em>This world is rough honey</em><br />\n<em>It&#8217;s just getting rougher now</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>You&#8217;re on top there, baby</em><br />\n<em>Just tryin&#8217; to score, well</em><br />\n<em>I seen enough, honey</em><br />\n<em>I don&#8217;t wanna see no more</em><br />\n<em>Drop on down and cover me</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Sometimes girl I just wanna</em><br />\n<em>Leave it all behind us</em><br />\n<em>Hold me in your arms tonight</em><br />\n<em>let&#8217;s let our love blind us</em></p>\n<p>But &#8220;Cover Me&#8221; rings of paranoia (&#8220;<em>Now promise me baby you won&#8217;t let them find us</em>&#8220;) and desperation, especially in the bridge:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em> Outside&#8217;s the rain, the driving snow</em><br />\n<em>I can hear the wild wind blowing</em><br />\n<em>Turn out the light, bolt the door</em><br />\n<em>I ain&#8217;t going out there no more</em></p>\n<p>In contrast, notice how Bruce alters the inclement weather of &#8220;Cover Me&#8221; to an internal storm in &#8220;Drop on Down and Cover Me.&#8221;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Inside I feel the pain that</em><br />\n<em>The hatred and the sorrow</em><br />\n<em>I wanna shut the light, baby</em><br />\n<em>C&#8217;mon and shut the door</em><br />\n<em>Drop on down and cover me</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I just wanna close my eyes and</em><br />\n<em>Let your love surround me</em><br />\n<em>I wanna close my heart</em><br />\n<em>To this world around me</em></p>\n<p>Both narrators are looking for shelter, but the protagonist of &#8220;Cover Me&#8221; is hiding from the world.

But &#8220;Drop on Down and Cover Me&#8221; is such a superior song to the officially released &#8220;Cover Me&#8221; that I can&#8217;t help but wonder why Bruce chose to release the older version.</p>\n<p>It clearly wasn&#8217;t always his intention to do so&#8211;in the summer of 1983, Bruce had an album sequence that included &#8220;Drop on Down and Cover Me&#8221; right in the middle of Side One (after &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/09/24/roll-of-the-dice-none-but-the-brave/\">None But the Brave</a>&#8221; and before &#8220;Shut Out the Light&#8221;&#8211;what an album that would have been).</p>\n<p>Unless we&#8217;re lucky enough to get a sign-requested debut someday, we&#8217;re not likely to ever gain any more insight; for now, we&#8217;ll just chalk it up as just one more unsolved Springsteen mystery.</p>\n<p><strong>Drop on Down and Cover Me<br />\nRecorded:</strong> May 31 &#8211; June 2, 1983<br />\n<strong>Never released</strong><br />\n<strong>Never performed</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a9 December 18, 2019</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>The shoulda-been &#8220;Cover Me&#8221; that never was.</p>\n", "protected": false}, "author": 1, "featured_media": 14929, "comment_status": "open", "ping_status": "open", "sticky": false, "template": "", "format": "standard", "meta": {"_monsterinsights_skip_tracking": false, "_monsterinsights_sitenote_active": false, "_monsterinsights_sitenote_note": "", "_monsterinsights_sitenote_category": 0, "jetpack_post_was_ever_published": false, "_jetpack_newsletter_access": "", "_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs": false, "_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id": 0, "_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content": false, "_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content": false, "footnotes": "", "jetpack_publicize_message": "", "jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled": true, "jetpack_social_post_already_shared": true, "jetpack_social_options": {"image_generator_settings": {"template": "highway", "default_image_id": 0, "font": "", "enabled": false}, "version": 2}}, "categories": [3611, 3], "tags": [942, 2587], "class_list": ["post-14888", "post", "type-post", "status-publish", "format-standard", "has-post-thumbnail", "hentry", "category-bitusa", "category-roll-of-the-dice", "tag-cover-me", "tag-drop-on-down-and-cover-me"], "aioseo_notices": [], "jetpack_publicize_connections": [], "jetpack_featured_media_url": "https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/dropcover.jpg?fit=2109%2C1054&ssl=1", "jetpack_sharing_enabled": true, "jetpack_shortlink": "https://wp.me/p9w3Lk-3S8", "jetpack_likes_enabled": true, "jetpack-related-posts": [{"id": 5897, "url": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/11/26/cover-me-bette-midler-pink-cadillac/", "url_meta": {"origin": 14888, "position": 0}, "title": "Cover Me, Bette Midler: Pink Cadillac", "author": "Ken", "date": "November 26, 2018", "format": false, "excerpt": "The Bruce cover that never was: Bette Midler recorded her version of \"Pink Cadillac,\" but Bruce refused to let her release it.
