While the lyrics were still largely the same, Bruce stripped out the paranoid urgency, dialed up the tenderness, and set it all against one of his best mid-eighties backing tracks (a melody so good, in fact, that he&#8217;d nick it a couple of weeks later for &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/04/06/roll-of-the-dice-janey-dont-you-lose-heart/\">Janey, Don&#8217;t You Lose Heart</a>&#8220;).</p>\n<p>The result: &#8220;Drop on Down and Cover Me,&#8221; which I&#8217;d rank at or very near the top of the still-missing-in-action outtakes crying out for an official release.</p>\n<p>Take a listen:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springstenn - Drop On Down And Cover Me\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4iQh-UzJiH4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure there&#8217;s a better example of how subtle changes can dramatically alter a song than &#8220;Drop on Down and Cover Me.&#8221; The lyrics undoubtedly sound very familiar&#8211;most of them are virtually identical.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Times are tough there baby</em><br />\n<em>It&#8217;s getting tougher now</em><br />\n<em>This world is rough honey</em><br />\n<em>It&#8217;s just getting rougher now</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>You&#8217;re on top there, baby</em><br />\n<em>Just tryin&#8217; to score, well</em><br />\n<em>I seen enough, honey</em><br />\n<em>I don&#8217;t wanna see no more</em><br />\n<em>Drop on down and cover me</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Sometimes girl I just wanna</em><br />\n<em>Leave it all behind us</em><br />\n<em>Hold me in your arms tonight</em><br />\n<em>let&#8217;s let our love blind us</em></p>\n<p>But &#8220;Cover Me&#8221; rings of paranoia (&#8220;<em>Now promise me baby you won&#8217;t let them find us</em>&#8220;) and desperation, especially in the bridge:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em> Outside&#8217;s the rain, the driving snow</em><br />\n<em>I can hear the wild wind blowing</em><br />\n<em>Turn out the light, bolt the door</em><br />\n<em>I ain&#8217;t going out there no more</em></p>\n<p>In contrast, notice how Bruce alters the inclement weather of &#8220;Cover Me&#8221; to an internal storm in &#8220;Drop on Down and Cover Me.&#8221;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Inside I feel the pain that</em><br />\n<em>The hatred and the sorrow</em><br />\n<em>I wanna shut the light, baby</em><br />\n<em>C&#8217;mon and shut the door</em><br />\n<em>Drop on down and cover me</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I just wanna close my eyes and</em><br />\n<em>Let your love surround me</em><br />\n<em>I wanna close my heart</em><br />\n<em>To this world around me</em></p>\n<p>Both narrators are looking for shelter, but the protagonist of &#8220;Cover Me&#8221; is hiding from the world. The hero of &#8220;Drop on Down and Cover Me&#8221; merely seeks momentary refuge and the strength that comes from having a partner in this world.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>The anger and the heartlessness</em><br />\n<em>All the good things killed</em><br />\n<em>Come closer baby</em><br />\n<em>Now closer still</em><br />\n<em>Drop on down and cover me</em></p>\n<p>Like all art, music is subjective. But &#8220;Drop on Down and Cover Me&#8221; is such a superior song to the officially released &#8220;Cover Me&#8221; that I can&#8217;t help but wonder why Bruce chose to release the older version.</p>\n<p>It clearly wasn&#8217;t always his intention to do so&#8211;in the summer of 1983, Bruce had an album sequence that included &#8220;Drop on Down and Cover Me&#8221; right in the middle of Side One (after &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/09/24/roll-of-the-dice-none-but-the-brave/\">None But the Brave</a>&#8221; and before &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/10/14/roll-of-the-dice-shut-out-the-light/\">Shut Out the Light</a>&#8220;&#8211;what an album that would have been).</p>\n<p>Unless we&#8217;re lucky enough to get a sign-requested debut someday, we&#8217;re not likely to ever gain any more insight; for now, we&#8217;ll just chalk it up as just one more unsolved Springsteen mystery.</p>\n<p><strong>Drop on Down and Cover Me<br />\nRecorded:</strong> May 31 &#8211; June 2, 1983<br />\n<strong>Never released</strong><br />\n<strong>Never performed</strong></p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
