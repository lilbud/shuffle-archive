None are complete yet, but all are likely to be finished by the end of this year.</p>\n<p>So that has me thinking about how I want to &#8220;package&#8221; them up when they&#8217;re complete. I&#8217;m leaning towards writing a companion piece for the album itself with links to the individual song articles, so I can write about the backstory and reception of the album itself. And while I was thinking about\u00a0<em>that,\u00a0</em>I remembered that I actually did complete one of Bruce&#8217;s discs a couple of years ago&#8211;although it was an EP, not a full album. Since most of those pieces were written early on, before I&#8217;d built up a strong readership, I thought I&#8217;d re-introduce them today.</p>\n<p>Bruce released\u00a0<em>American Beauty</em> on April 19, 2014&#8211;Record Store Day. A promotional vinyl disc with a limited run of only 7,500 copies, it was also released as a digital download a few days later.</p>\n<p>All four tracks on the EP are outtakes from the\u00a0<em>High Hopes\u00a0</em>album Bruce released just a few months prior, although some tracks are quite a bit older. Each track stands out from Bruce&#8217;s main body of work, each for a different reason.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/02/21/roll-of-the-dice-american-beauty/\">American Beauty</a>,&#8221; the title track, a hard-rocking musical melange that shares DNA with several of Bruce&#8217;s songs yet sounds like none of them</li>\n<li>&#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/04/01/roll-of-the-dice-mary-mary/\">Mary Mary,</a>&#8221; a sweet love song and close melodic cousin to &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/12/25/roll-of-the-dice-we-take-care-of-our-own/\">We Take Care of Our Own</a>&#8220;</li>\n<li>&#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/04/26/roll-of-the-dice-hurry-up-sundown/\">Hurry Up Sundown</a>,&#8221; which out power-pops everything on <em>Magic</em> and <em>Working on a Dream</em></li>\n<li>&#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/06/30/roll-of-the-dice-hey-blue-eyes/\">Hey Blue Eyes</a>,&#8221; perhaps Bruce&#8217;s most ferocious social commentary song on record</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The four songs don&#8217;t form any kind of cohesive whole, but they&#8217;re not meant to&#8211;they&#8217;re just four strong outtakes that didn&#8217;t make their respective albums because Bruce had too much great material to work with.</p>\n<p>Since both the press run and press coverage were limited, all four songs went under the radar of many fans, but each is worthy of a listen and consideration. If you haven&#8217;t taken a listen to\u00a0<em>American Beauty\u00a0</em>lately, maybe take a few minutes to do so now&#8211;it&#8217;s a quick and rewarding listen, and if I did my job well, the companion Roll of the Dice pieces will help highlight some of the songs&#8217; more interesting facets.</p>\n<p>More to come soon as we start polishing off album by album in 2022!</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>Let&#8217;s take a moment to revisit Bruce&#8217;s only EP with all new material.</p>\n", "protected": false}, "author": 1, "featured_media": 32757, "comment_status": "open", "ping_status": "open", "sticky": false, "template": "", "format": "standard", "meta": {"_monsterinsights_skip_tracking": false, "_monsterinsights_sitenote_active": false, "_monsterinsights_sitenote_note": "", "_monsterinsights_sitenote_category": 0, "jetpack_post_was_ever_published": false, "_jetpack_newsletter_access": "", "_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs": false, "_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id": 0, "_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content": false, "_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content": false, "footnotes": "", "jetpack_publicize_message": "", "jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled": true, "jetpack_social_post_already_shared": true, "jetpack_social_options": {"image_generator_settings": {"template": "highway", "default_image_id": 0, "font": "", "enabled": false}, "version": 2}}, "categories": [3], "tags": [655], "class_list": ["post-32756", "post", "type-post", "status-publish", "format-standard", "has-post-thumbnail", "hentry", "category-roll-of-the-dice", "tag-american-beauty"], "aioseo_notices": [], "jetpack_publicize_connections": [], "jetpack_featured_media_url": "https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/BRUCE_AMERICAN_BEAUTY-500x500-300x300-1.jpg?fit=980%2C980&ssl=1", "jetpack_sharing_enabled": true, "jetpack_shortlink": "https://wp.me/p9w3Lk-8wk", "jetpack_likes_enabled": true, "jetpack-related-posts": [{"id": 17541, "url": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/04/26/roll-of-the-dice-hurry-up-sundown/", "url_meta": {"origin": 32756, "position": 0}, "title": "Roll of the Dice: Hurry Up Sundown", "author": "Ken", "date": "April 26, 2020", "format": false, "excerpt": "Hidden away on a barely promoted Record Store Day EP, \"Hurry Up Sundown\" is a slick (if overproduced) piece of power pop, perfect for an open road on a sunny day.", "rel": "", "context": "In &quot;Roll of the Dice&quot;", "block_context": {"text": "Roll of the Dice", "link": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/category/roll-of-the-dice/"}, "img": {"alt_text": "", "src": "https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/hurrysundown.jpg?fit=1200%2C801&ssl=1&resize=350%2C200", "width": 350, "height": 200, "srcset": "https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/hurrysundown.jpg?fit=1200%2C801&ssl=1&resize=350%2C200 1x, https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/hurrysundown.jpg?fit=1200%2C801&ssl=1&resize=525%2C300 1.5x, https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/hurrysundown.jpg?fit=1200%2C801&ssl=1&resize=700%2C400 2x, https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/hurrysundown.jpg?fit=1200%2C801&ssl=1&resize=1050%2C600 3x"}, "classes": []}, {"id": 36532, "url": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/08/02/roll-of-the-dice-sun-time/", "url_meta": {"origin": 32756, "position": 1}, "title": "Roll of the Dice: Sun Time", "author": "Ken", "date": "August 2, 2022", "format": false, "excerpt": "One of the final entries in Bruce's 1968 Notebook is a tender (bordering on sappy) love song he never recorded.", "rel": "", "context": "In &quot;Roll of the Dice&quot;", "block_context": {"text": "Roll of the Dice", "link": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/category/roll-of-the-dice/"}, "img": {"alt_text": "", "src": "https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/suntime.jpg?fit=1200%2C800&ssl=1&resize=350%2C200", "width": 350, "height": 200, "srcset": "https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/suntime.jpg?fit=1200%2C800&ssl=1&resize=350%2C200 1x, https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/suntime.jpg?fit=1200%2C800&ssl=1&resize=525%2C300 1.5x, https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/suntime.jpg?fit=1200%2C800&ssl=1&resize=700%2C400 2x, https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/suntime.jpg?fit=1200%2C800&ssl=1&resize=1050%2C600 3x"}, "classes": []}, {"id": 7529, "url": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/02/21/roll-of-the-dice-american-beauty/", "url_meta": {"origin": 32756, "position": 2}, "title": "Roll of the Dice: American Beauty", "author": "Ken", "date": "February 21, 2019", "format": false, "excerpt": "Recycled melange or original organ donor?
