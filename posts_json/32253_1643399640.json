But for at least one track the process was a lot more iterative.</p>\n<p>Joe wrote the lyrics for &#8220;I&#8217;m Not Sleeping&#8221; as political commentary on the state of the union, but his inspiration was his father&#8217;s playful excuse when his mother called him out for falling asleep on them: &#8220;I&#8217;m not sleeping!,&#8221; Joe&#8217;s dad would say, &#8220;I&#8217;m only resting my eyes.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Joe realized their family joke would also make for a great hook in a song for anyone who&#8217;s ever been overwhelmed by the 24-hour news cycle and needed to tune out the world for a bit. We&#8217;re not sleeping; we&#8217;re just resting our eyes.</p>\n<p>Joe shared his lyrics with Bruce during a 1995 songwriting session, and Bruce set them to music. But this time, their back-and-forth continued for several iterations, with Bruce and Joe each taking ideas from the other, sharing and absorbing, tweaking and recording, until they finally arrived at a song that bore both of their stamps.</p>\n<p>Joe recorded released &#8220;I&#8217;m Not Sleeping&#8221; on his 1998 album, <em>Coming Home.</em></p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"I&#039;m Not Sleeping\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VCVz7Vlvyo4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I never go out, I just stay at home</em><br />\n<em>Change my address and disconnect the phone</em><br />\n<em>Turn off the TV because it bothers me</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;ve seen all, seen all I want to see</em><br />\n<em>And if my friends ask where I&#8217;ve been</em><br />\n<em>Just say I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s become of him</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well I&#8217;m not sleeping</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;m only resting my eyes</em><br />\n<em>Well I&#8217;m not sleeping</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;m only taking my time</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well it&#8217;s so hard, so hard to be responsible</em><br />\n<em>Knowing everything, everything that&#8217;s possible</em><br />\n<em>When the bad wind, when it comes blowing in</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;ll pack my things and I&#8217;ll move on again</em><br />\n<em>I feed the rich and fool the poor</em><br />\n<em>Stack the bodies outside my door</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>The world outside is such a dangerous place</em><br />\n<em>That I don&#8217;t dare, I don&#8217;t dare show my face</em><br />\n<em>They got my number, they know where I live</em><br />\n<em>Well I&#8217;ve got no more to say, I&#8217;ve got no more to give</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>But I&#8217;m not sleeping</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Another night comes drawing near</em><br />\n<em>I shut my doors and then I disappear</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>But I&#8217;m not sleeping</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;m only resting my eyes</em></p>\n<p>In a just world, &#8220;I&#8217;m Not Sleeping&#8221; would have been a hit single. It had all the elements, and it sounds even more relevant and fresh today than it did in 1998. (At least one of Joe&#8217;s lines also snuck its way into one of Bruce&#8217;s songs almost a decade later. Can you spot it?)</p>\n<p>But while Bruce doesn&#8217;t appear on Joe&#8217;s studio track and hasn&#8217;t released his own version, he performed it live on stage with Joe eight times over a four-year period from 2010 to 2014. Those performances are an absolute joy to behold: Joe and Bruce perform it as a true duet, and not only does Bruce clearly enjoy singing it, he knows it well enough to not even glance at a teleprompter&#8211;a pretty rare thing in recent years.</p>\n<p>Joe and Bruce&#8217;s performances of &#8220;I&#8217;m Not Sleeping&#8221; are so great, in fact, that I can&#8217;t bring myself to choose just one to feature here. So let&#8217;s enjoy this pair of clips from 2010 and 2011 and appreciate the artistry and chemistry of the Grushecky/Springsteen songwriting team.</p>\n<div id=\"v-S42c7wmq-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='424' src='https://videopress.com/embed/S42c7wmq?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<div id=\"v-bNmTsDJo-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='424' src='https://videopress.com/embed/bNmTsDJo?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p><strong>I&#8217;m Not Sleeping<br />\nReleased:\u00a0</strong><em>Coming Home\u00a0</em>(1998)<br />\n<strong>First performed:</strong> November 4, 2010 (Pittsburgh, PA)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> May 23, 2014 (Pittsburgh, PA)</p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
