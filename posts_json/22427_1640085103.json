From the mid-1960s to the early 1970s, Bruce travelled from The Castiles to Earth to Child to Steel Mill to The Bruce Springsteen Band (with a Dr. Zoom and the Sonic Boom dalliance and a Sundance Blues Band detour) before finally convening the original E Street Band in late 1972.</p>\n<p>But any reasonably close inspection of Bruce&#8217;s bands from Child onward reveals that there was a whole lot of E Street from Bruce&#8217;s earliest days. Vini Lopez and Danny Federici were founding members of Child in 1968; Steve Van Zandt joined them in Steel Mill in 1970; and Garry Tallent and David Sancious enlisted in the Bruce Springsteen Band in 1971.</p>\n<p>With so many familiar players carrying over from one band to the next, there was understandably a lot of sonic carryover as well. Early Bruce Springsteen band gigs sounded a lot like Steel Mill, and early E Street Band shows sounded a whole lot like The Bruce Springsteen Band.</p>\n<p>The Bruce Springsteen Band was known for loose, jazzy, bluesy performances. If Steel Mill set pieces were all about the guitars, in the BSB every player had a chance to shine.</p>\n<p>The original E Street Band was virtually identical to the Bruce Springsteen Band; in fact, new addition Clarence Clemons is the\u00a0<em>only </em>original E Streeter who wasn&#8217;t in Bruce&#8217;s previous band. And with so much personnel continuity, it shouldn&#8217;t surprise us to learn that the early E Street Band sound was pretty similar to the late Bruce Springsteen Band sound.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the best illustration of this can be found in our heroes&#8217; cover of &#8220;Walking the Dog,&#8221; originally recorded by Rufus Thomas. &#8220;Walking the Dog&#8221; is an odd song; with verses based almost entirely on a children&#8217;s nursery rhyme paired with a non sequitur chorus and dog whistles, it verges perilously close to a novelty song. Despite (or perhaps because of) that, &#8220;Walking the Dog&#8221; became a hit for Thomas, cracking the Top Ten in 1963.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Rufus Thomas - Walking The Dog (1964)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fw1KAlQSYjw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>There&#8217;s something irresistibly charming about &#8220;Walking the Dog,&#8221; which may explain why the Rolling Stones fell under its spell&#8211;they recorded and released their own cover the following year.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Walking the dog \ud83d\udc36 The Rolling Stones 1964\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/g_VU6BY4xSY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>As for Bruce and his band(s), &#8220;Walking the Dog&#8221; was frequently set listed from late 1971 through mid-1974. There aren&#8217;t any great quality Bruce Springsteen Band performances of &#8220;Walking the Dog&#8221; circulating, but documents exist of their 1971 and 1972 performances.</p>\n<p>The E Street Band didn&#8217;t revive &#8220;Walking the Dog&#8221; until the autumn of 1973, almost a year after they first formed, but once they did it remained a regular set list habitu\u00e9, making almost two dozen appearances between October 1973 and the following spring.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Walking the Dog&#8221; performances by the E Street Band (although they wouldn&#8217;t actually go by that name until after the song had dropped from their set list altogether) were as playful and loose as the Bruce Springsteen Band&#8217;s.</p>\n<p>No two performances sounded alike. Take, for example, these two early 1974 performances. First, let&#8217;s listen to their January 29th performance at Muther&#8217;s Music Emporium in Nashville. (Disregard the incorrect date and venue displayed in the video below.)</p>\n<div id=\"v-yJb7k2NK-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='568' src='https://videopress.com/embed/yJb7k2NK?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>In this clip, the E Street Band is light on its feet, despite drummer Vini Lopez&#8217;s charmingly sloppy propulsion. Bruce commands the band like a drill sergeant (right down to the whistle), even though the band just wans to &#8220;Party!&#8221;</p>\n<p>Bruce keeps the original nonsensical lyrics unaltered, but it quickly becomes clear that the lyrics aren&#8217;t the point, anyway. Danny and Davey both take terrific solos on the keys, and Clarence is his usual force of nature self.</p>\n<p>By the end of the song, the E Street Band is racing for the finish line, with Bruce barely able to keep up&#8211;which makes this next clip all the more astonishing. It&#8217;s not even five weeks later (March 3, 1974), but we might as well be listening to an entirely different band.</p>\n<p>This E Street Band is sneakier and sultrier, but Bruce is in even tighter control, frequently bringing the band to a halt for a &#8220;What it is!&#8221; by the Big Man, a primal scream by the bandleader, or a long, loooonnnngggg stone silence.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen &amp; the E-Street Band-Walking the Dog (live)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ra7nlRC3p4k?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>This &#8220;Walking the Dog&#8221; is almost an entirely new arrangement from the band&#8217;s previous performance, but one thing hasn&#8217;t changed: it&#8217;s still a showcase for some spectacular solos from Danny, David, and Clarence. (Bruce isn&#8217;t bad, either.)</p>\n<p>The E Street Band played their last &#8220;Walking the Dog&#8221; on April 9, 1974, one month to the day before they debuted their official stage name. They haven&#8217;t played it in all the years since, but Bruce has played it twice without them. The most recent time was in 2004 at The Stone Pony with Joe Grushecky; no audio circulates from that show, however.</p>\n<p>There was one other time, however&#8211;way back in 1982, with Sonny Kenn &amp; The Wild Ideas at Big Man&#8217;s West in the spring of 1982.</p>\n<div id=\"v-GNPWZPcD-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='568' src='https://videopress.com/embed/GNPWZPcD?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>That performance was nowhere near as daring or expansive as any of the Bruce Springsteen Band or E Street Band versions, but it remains the last recorded document of Bruce performing a song that was a staple of his early set lists.</p>\n<p><strong>Walking the Dog<br />\n</strong><strong>First performed:\u00a0</strong>December 11, 1971 (Asbury Park, NJ)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> July 17, 2004 (Asbury Park, NJ)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>The early E Street Band had a lot in common with the late Bruce Springsteen Band, and nowhere was that more apparent than in their cover of Rufus Thomas&#8217; &#8220;Walking the Dog.&#8221;</p>\n", "protected": false}, "author": 1, "featured_media": 22928, "comment_status": "open", "ping_status": "open", "sticky": false, "template": "", "format": "standard", "meta": {"_monsterinsights_skip_tracking": false, "_monsterinsights_sitenote_active": false, "_monsterinsights_sitenote_note": "", "_monsterinsights_sitenote_category": 0, "jetpack_post_was_ever_published": false, "_jetpack_newsletter_access": "", "_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs": false, "_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id": 0, "_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content": false, "_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content": false, "footnotes": "", "jetpack_publicize_message": "", "jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled": true, "jetpack_social_post_already_shared": true, "jetpack_social_options": {"image_generator_settings": {"template": "highway", "default_image_id": 0, "font": "", "enabled": false}, "version": 2}}, "categories": [4], "tags": [2970, 2433, 2969], "class_list": ["post-22427", "post", "type-post", "status-publish", "format-standard", "has-post-thumbnail", "hentry", "category-cover-me", "tag-rufus-thomas", "tag-the-rolling-stones", "tag-walking-the-dog"], "aioseo_notices": [], "jetpack_publicize_connections": [], "jetpack_featured_media_url": "https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/walkingdog-1.jpg?fit=522%2C522&ssl=1", "jetpack_sharing_enabled": true, "jetpack_shortlink": "https://wp.me/p9w3Lk-5PJ", "jetpack_likes_enabled": true, "jetpack-related-posts": [{"id": 25697, "url": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/02/28/cover-me-sitting-on-top-of-the-world-2/", "url_meta": {"origin": 22427, "position": 0}, "title": "Cover Me: Sitting on Top of the World", "author": "Ken", "date": "February 28, 2021", "format": false, "excerpt": "One time only (that we can listen to, at least): Listen to The Bruce Springsteen Band at their bluesiest, as they cover Howlin' Wolf's Chicago blues classic.", "rel": "", "context": "In &quot;Cover Me&quot;", "block_context": {"text": "Cover Me", "link": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/category/cover-me/"}, "img": {"alt_text": "", "src": "https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sitting.jpg?fit=600%2C600&ssl=1&resize=350%2C200", "width": 350, "height": 200, "srcset": "https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sitting.jpg?fit=600%2C600&ssl=1&resize=350%2C200 1x, https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sitting.jpg?fit=600%2C600&ssl=1&resize=525%2C300 1.5x"}, "classes": []}, {"id": 29688, "url": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/09/25/cover-me-train-ride/", "url_meta": {"origin": 22427, "position": 1}, "title": "Cover Me: Train Ride", "author": "Ken", "date": "September 25, 2021", "format": false, "excerpt": "Bruce wasn't Steel Mill's only songwriter.
