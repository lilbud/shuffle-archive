Known as the father of Brazilian rock with a catalog of 21 albums across 26 years (one more album than Bruce has released in almost twice that time), Seixas produced a massive body of work across multiple genres.</p>\n<p>Over the course of his career, Seixas gravitated increasingly toward counterculture, and by the time of his second solo album\u00a0<em>Gita</em> in 1974, he was singing openly of the Sociedade Alternativa, the Alternative Society. His song by that title was as much mission statement as rock anthem.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Raul Seixas - Sociedade Alternativa (Videoclipe Oficial)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CfgYcLBP9lI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Influenced heavily by Alistair Crowley&#8217;s Law of Thelema (<i>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law)</i>, Seixas credo captures the essence of rock and roll pretty well, too.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a touring rock band visiting Brazil, odds are pretty good that you&#8217;re going to hear someone shout &#8220;Toca Raul!&#8221; (&#8220;Play Raul!&#8221;) at some point during the night. It&#8217;s kind of the Brazilian equivalent of &#8220;Freebird!&#8221;</p>\n<p>So when Bruce took the stage for each of his two Brazilian shows in 2013&#8211;his first visit to the country in a quarter-century&#8211;he satisfied the &#8220;Toca Raul&#8221; contingent before they even had a chance to utter a single one.</p>\n<p>Enjoy this professionally shot, Clearmountain-mixed, and
