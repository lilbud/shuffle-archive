In fact, Max Weinberg recalls basing his memorable hi-hat introduction on a Barry White song (most likely &#8220;Never Never Gonna Give You Up&#8221;), so much did Bruce&#8217;s early &#8220;Fast Song&#8221; vocals remind him of the famous R&amp;B singer.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Never, Never Gonna Give Ya Up\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QpbhSlce_ek?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>By early June, Bruce had lyrics for &#8220;The Fast Song&#8221; that were polished enough to start recording, and in this next track we can hear how Bruce&#8217;s &#8220;God&#8217;s Angels&#8221; (as the song is sometimes known) line developed into a full song.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen The Fast Song #1 Instrumental\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-v-vHVjwFpI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>This version of &#8220;The Fast Song&#8221; springs to vibrant life from the get-go thanks to the presence of the full E Street Band. Danny Federici&#8217;s glockenspiel brings the nameless love interest to life, the only brightness in this otherwise dark song. Bruce&#8217;s screaming guitar solo is clearly meant as an homage to The Yardbirds&#8217; &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/10/03/cover-me-heart-full-of-soul/\">Heart Full of Soul,</a>&#8221; which Bruce recalls &#8220;playing the hell out of many a night&#8221; in his early days.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"The Yardbirds - Heart Full Of Soul\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pM1qZBFiOLU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Musically, &#8220;The Fast Song&#8221; is a tour de force, somehow sounding both punk and classic at the same time. Lyrically, though, Bruce was still searching.</p>\n<p>We can hear the desperation at the heart of &#8220;Candy&#8217;s Room&#8221; in this early iteration, but Bruce&#8217;s narrator is too obsessed with his own self-torture for the song to work. We don&#8217;t even know there&#8217;s a romantic interest until the second verse, and we don&#8217;t learn a thing about her until the third.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>The night rushes into the door</em><br />\n<em>Kids running across the floor, hmm</em><br />\n<em>I wish God&#8217;s angels would tear this town down and blow it into the sea</em><br />\n<em>Man that&#8217;s alright with me, I don&#8217;t care anymore</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>She, she who is everything</em><br />\n<em>And the fear tonight she brings, she&#8217;s got everything</em><br />\n<em>And I got caught wasting my life so bad</em><br />\n<em>Just looking for the facts</em><br />\n<em>Sometimes I feel like I&#8217;m walking dazed</em><br />\n<em>The blood rushing in my veins, I can hear it flow</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>She lives in a world of dreams-come-true</em><br />\n<em>But she don&#8217;t know like I do, not like I do</em><br />\n<em>I was nothing over and over again</em><br />\n<em>Counting the nights roll in without her</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>She needs her clothes and diamond rings</em><br />\n<em>She got men who bring her anything she wants, but they don&#8217;t see</em><br />\n<em>That what she wants is me</em><br />\n<em>Oh and I want her so, I&#8217;ll never let her go</em><br />\n<em>Me, walking into the room, I count the nights ???</em><br />\n<em>Without her, without her, without her</em></p>\n<p>That fourth verse, though&#8230; now, we&#8217;re cooking. Other than the &#8220;blood rushing&#8221; line in the second verse, the final verse is the only original lyric from &#8220;The Fast Song&#8221; to remain relatively intact and land safely on the final track.</p>\n<p>But that&#8217;s a thread we&#8217;ll pick up another day, when we (finally!) bring the pieces together and take a deep listen to &#8220;Candy&#8217;s Room.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> The early take of &#8220;The Fast Song&#8221; is too muddy to listen to more than once, but it&#8217;s worth that lone listen just to admire Bruce&#8217;s guitar solo that wouldn&#8217;t make it to the final version.</p>\n<div id=\"v-ejuhlzzg-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='568' src='https://videopress.com/embed/ejuhlzzg?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p><strong>The Fast Song<br />\n</strong><strong>Recorded:\u00a0</strong>June-September, 1977<br />\n<strong>Never released</strong><br />\n<strong>Never performed</strong></p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
