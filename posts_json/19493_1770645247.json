[T]he people who we admired and emulated&#8211;which for me obviously begins with Dylan&#8211;had a very clear political voice. John [Fogerty] did it more subtly, but fabulously also.&#8221;\u00a0 <em>&#8211;Bruce Springsteen to Christopher Phillips, Backstreets, February 10, 2009</em></span></p></blockquote>\n<p>Bruce Springsteen has been a fan of John Fogerty for as long as he&#8217;s been playing music, calling Fogerty &#8220;the Hank Williams of my generation.&#8221; As early as his days in Child, Bruce included the music of Creedence Clearwater Revival in his sets. The River Tour famously included covers of &#8220;Who&#8217;ll Stop the Rain&#8221; and &#8220;Run Through the Jungle,&#8221; and in 1993 Bruce had the privilege of inducting John into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"758\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dgpMGNVf9lw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></div>\n<p>But at the dawn of the 21st century, it seemed for a while like John might have said all that he had to say. Seven long years went by without new music from Fogerty, until inspiration struck in an election year.</p>\n<p>In 2004, America was deeply divided over its leadership and involvement in a foreign war. That&#8217;s the environment that John Fogerty was built for. John met the moment by releasing a new album,\u00a0<em>Deja Vu All Over Again,\u00a0</em>with a terrific title track that compared the current conflict with the Vietnam War in a tone both jaded and pointed.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"758\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/E6Yo647AYSY?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></div>\n<p>(If you get a sense of deja vu yourself while listening to the song, that&#8217;s probably because there are definite echoes of CCR&#8217;s &#8220;Have You Ever Seen the Rain&#8221; &#8212; an homage I&#8217;d like to think was intentional given the more recent song&#8217;s title.)</p>\n<p>&#8220;Deja Vu (All Over Again)&#8221; was a perfect song for the moment, so when John and Bruce joined forces later that year for the Vote For Change Tour in support of presidential candidate John Kerry, it was a perfect spotlight song for John on the set list.</p>\n<p>John played &#8220;Deja Vu (All Over Again)&#8221; nightly during the brief Vote For Change Tour, backed by Bruce and the E Street Band.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"758\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0rDbjlLIAFg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></div>\n<p>The Vote For Change shows were powerful and energizing, but ultimately ineffective&#8211;that year at least.</p>\n<p>It would take another four years before Americans would truly vote for change, and while Bruce and John would team up several more times over the decade that followed, they&#8217;d never play &#8220;Deja Vu (All Over Again)&#8221; again.</p>\n<p><strong>Deja Vu (All Over Again)<br />\nFirst performed:</strong> October 1, 2004 (Philadelphia, PA)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> October 13, 2004 (East Rutherford, NJ)</p>\n<p>\u00a9 July 11, 2020</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>When America found itself enmeshed in an unpopular foreign war (again), John Fogerty met the moment.
