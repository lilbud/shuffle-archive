He&#8217;s missing just one thing. In &#8220;Ain&#8217;t Got You,&#8221; he sings of his fame, success, and worldly wealth&#8211;all of which mean nothing to him without the one thing he lacks: love.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"758\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5iO8d8m0esY?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></div>\n<p>In retrospect, it&#8217;s easy to see &#8220;Ain&#8217;t Got You&#8221; as autobiographical. (For those following the gossip columns, it wasn&#8217;t that hard at the time, either.)</p>\n<p>It would be almost five years before we&#8217;d hear more new music from Bruce, five years in which his first marriage publicly dissolved, his second union established, and his first child entered the world. Unsurprisingly, both\u00a0<em>Human Touch</em> and <em>Lucky Town</em> feature veins of happiness, devotion and fidelity in place of the restlessness, temptations, and demons that laced his previous album.</p>\n<p>If\u00a0<em>Tunnel of Love\u00a0</em>is about the decisions we&#8217;re faced with and the choices we make,\u00a0<em>Human Touch\u00a0</em>and\u00a0<em>Lucky Town</em> are about the satisfaction that comes with having made the right choices.\u00a0So it&#8217;s a nice bit of symmetry when Bruce closes\u00a0<em>Lucky Town</em> by revisiting the same character that opens\u00a0<em>Tunnel of Love&#8211;</em>now five years into what we&#8217;d expect would be his happily ever after&#8211;in a lovely folk ballad called &#8220;My Beautiful Reward.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"758\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TSq34PgSl-Q?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></div>\n<p>However: this is a Springsteen song, and in Springsteen songs happiness may be <em>after</em> but it is rarely <em>ever</em>. Bruce&#8217;s narrator in &#8220;My Beautiful Reward&#8221; had the riches, the mansion on the hill, and even the girl, but it still wasn&#8217;t enough.</p>\n<p>What do you do when life hands you everything you&#8217;ve ever wanted on a silver platter, and you&#8217;re\u00a0<em>still</em> not satisfied? You keep seeking.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well I sought gold and diamond rings</em><br />\n<em>My own drug to ease the pain that living brings</em><br />\n<em>Walked from the mountain to the valley floor</em><br />\n<em>Searching for my beautiful reward</em></p>\n<p>Although they couldn&#8217;t be more different musically, Bruce constructs &#8220;My Beautiful Reward&#8221; and &#8220;Aint Got You&#8221; with lyrical parallelism. Both songs refer to diamonds and gold in their first line<em>,</em> but while the younger man crows of his wealth <em>(I got the fortunes of heaven in diamonds and gold&#8230;)</em>, the older and wiser man recognizes his material riches as a drug to numb the daily pain of a life lacking in meaning.</p>\n<p>The narrator&#8217;s trek from the mountaintop to the valley floor is a metaphor for the songwriter&#8217;s own back-turning on his mid-eighties mega-stardom.</p>\n<p>The second verses are parallel as well, with both songs focusing on homes full of possessions <em>(I got a house full of Rembrandt and priceless art)</em> but devoid of presence.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>From a house on a hill a sacred light shines</em><br />\n<em>I walk through these rooms but none of them are mine</em><br />\n<em>Down empty hallways I went from door to door</em><br />\n<em>Searching for my beautiful reward</em></p>\n<p>(It&#8217;s no coincidence that Bruce sets his character&#8217;s house upon a hill&#8211;that&#8217;s a callback to the powerful symbolism such homes have had for him at least as far back as\u00a0<em>Nebraska</em> and most likely back to his childhood.)</p>\n<p>Both songs segue into their bridges at this point. In &#8220;Ain&#8217;t Got You,&#8221; our narrator makes a deal with the devil to win his love. In &#8220;My Beautiful Reward,&#8221; we are reminded that such deals often don&#8217;t bring the lasting satisfaction we expect them to.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well your hair shone in the sun</em><br />\n<em>I was so high and I was the lucky one</em><br />\n<em>Then I came crashing down like a drunk on a barroom floor</em><br />\n<em>Searching for my beautiful reward</em></p>\n<p>Our narrator had his lover&#8217;s affections for a time, but he lost them&#8211;and it&#8217;s implied by the metaphor (one that Bruce re-uses in &#8220;All the Way Home&#8221;) that it&#8217;s the result of his own actions and temptations. When fame and wealth don&#8217;t bring satisfaction, it makes sense to assume love will. So when it doesn&#8217;t, what do you do?</p>\n<p>You keep searching.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Tonight I can feel the cold wind at my back</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;m flying high over gray fields, my feathers long and black</em><br />\n<em>Down along the river&#8217;s silent edge I soar</em><br />\n<em>Searching for my beautiful reward</em></p>\n<p>In this final, ethereal and dreamlike verse, our narrator is transformed into a raven&#8211;a symbol in many cultures of insight, wisdom and knowledge, but also of darkness and destruction. Bruce&#8217;s selection of it as his avatar is deliberate and significant. It reveals a self-awareness combined with a certain powerlessness. Our narrator is destined to forever wander the world searching for something he knows he&#8217;s missing&#8230; something hidden in the one place where he&#8217;ll never find it: himself.</p>\n<p>At face value, it&#8217;s an unsettling note to end on, but the lilting backing track conveys peaceful acceptance rather than a curse. That may be the artist winking at us, because for a songwriter whose work relies on the search, an ever-elusive reward is the kind that matters most.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>On the album, &#8220;My Beautiful Reward&#8221; is essentially a solo track: Bruce plays every instrument except for drums (Gary Mallaber provides them throughout\u00a0<em>Lucky Town</em>) and organ (a rare cameo by Ian McLagan of Small Faces).</p>\n<p>On tour, however, &#8220;My Beautiful Reward&#8221; was an ensemble number, albeit a restrained one. Throughout World Tour 1992-93, Bruce offered it as one of his final numbers of the evening in an arrangement that bordered on benediction.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"758\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/a33WgD5_JPw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></div>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"758\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TSha5L9oW0Q?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></div>\n<p>&#8220;My Beautiful Reward&#8221; featured nightly throughout the tour but disappeared for over a decade immediately after.
