Most are at least partially (and often mostly) bluffed, and many ultimately led nowhere.</p>\n<p>Today&#8217;s entry definitely falls into the &#8220;mostly bluffed&#8221; category, but it definitely led somewhere. It goes by the name &#8220;Love and Kisses,&#8221; one of the few repeated lyrics that can be clearly understood.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen Love And Kisses #1\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/D7ipTwv9qUE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Bruce&#8217;s vocals are so heavily bluffed that it&#8217;s not worth trying to transcribe the lyrics, but we can hear just enough to discern a romantic song in the making.</p>\n<p>But it&#8217;s the melody that&#8217;s revealing here: if it sounds familiar, that&#8217;s because it&#8217;s the foundation of an officially released outtake from a few years later. Bruce obviously thought enough of his musical composition to revive it for &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/02/07/roll-of-the-dice-wages-of-sin/\">Wages of Sin</a>&#8221; during the <em>Born in the U.S.A.</em> sessions.</p>\n<p>Bruce continued working on &#8220;Love and Kisses,&#8221; evolving the melody into something a bit more distinctive (take a listen below).
