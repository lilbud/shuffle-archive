Tonight was no different: he kicked off the rehearsal with &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/02/15/cover-me-wedding-bells/\">Wedding Bells</a>&#8221; and tinkered with &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/05/02/cover-me-i-cant-help-it-if-im-still-in-love-with-you/\">I Can&#8217;t Help It (If I&#8217;m Still in Love With You)</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/12/07/cover-me-i-heard-that-lonesome-whistle/\">(I Heard That) Lonesome Whistle</a>&#8221; as well.</p>\n<p>But in the middle of the session, he dialed up a double-shot of The Man in Black. Bruce would cover the latter of the pair (&#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/06/16/cover-me-i-walk-the-line/\">I Walk the Line</a>&#8220;) in concert following Cash&#8217;s death decades later. The former, however, was a one-time-only affair.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Guess Things Happen That Way&#8221; was one of Cash&#8217;s earliest hits&#8211;his fourth #1 single on the country chart, a spot it refused to give up for a full eight weeks in 1958.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Guess Things Happen That Way (2017 Remaster)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cfah3L0dIz0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Bruce took two brief runs through the song on that late summer day, the first in his customary singing voice and the second in a register clearly intended to evoke the original artist. Neither run-through was a full pass through the song, but it was enough for us to get a sense of what Bruce&#8217;s cover might have sounded like if he&#8217;d played it in full.</p>\n<div id=\"v-V1Cw03T0-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='568' src='https://videopress.com/embed/V1Cw03T0?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>&#8220;Guess Things Happen That Way&#8221; never made it into Bruce&#8217;s set list that night or any other.
