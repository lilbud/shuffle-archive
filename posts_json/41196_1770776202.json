But he also added, &#8220;and the pain of losing one another to illness and time.&#8221;</p>\n<p>On both record and stage, it&#8217;s easy to hear the joy. It takes a closer listen to hear the pain.</p>\n<p>We might not want to. It&#8217;s been a long couple of years, and who could blame us for wanting to crank up the stereo or rock out in an arena without thinking about our losses?</p>\n<p>But we should. Bruce surely does, each and every time he plays &#8220;Ghosts&#8221; nightly. He&#8217;s both the song&#8217;s messenger and audience, nursing his pain by feeding his joy. He&#8217;s figured out what we all learn as we age: the sweetest joys are the most ephemeral.</p>\n<p>The plot twist is one we only learn toward the end of our lives: <em>everything</em> is ephemeral.</p>\n<p>At first, and for much of the song, Bruce sings to his childhood friend and former bandmate, George Theiss. The founder of Bruce&#8217;s very first band, The Castiles, Theiss loomed large in Bruce&#8217;s life, setting him on a path he&#8217;s walked ever since.</p>\n<p>Theiss passed away five years ago this month, a few weeks shy of fifty years since The Castiles&#8217; final performance. Springsteen visited him in his final days.</p>\n<p>&#8220;George had been in a rough battle with lung cancer the last years of his life and he only had a few days to live,&#8221; Bruce recalled from the stage earlier this year. &#8220;And I realized that his passing would leave me as the last surviving member of [The Castiles]. It&#8217;s sort of like you&#8217;re standing on the railroad tracks, with the white-hot light of an oncoming train bearing down on you. It brings a certain clarity of thought that you haven&#8217;t previously experienced.&#8221;</p>\n<p>With that newfound clarity of thought, Springsteen went home and wrote &#8220;Last Man Standing.&#8221; Most of what became <em>Letter to You</em> followed shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p>Bruce has used that phrase a lot in the years since:\u00a0<em>last man standing.</em> Although he never voices it, I get the sense that in his mind, it&#8217;s followed by the words:\u00a0<em>next to go.</em></p>\n<p>That&#8217;s the specter that haunts &#8220;Ghosts.&#8221; Not the surface joy, nor the subtext of loss, but the undeniable truth of: <em>you&#8217;re next</em>.</p>\n<p>We don&#8217;t hear it immediately, though. As &#8220;Ghosts&#8221; opens, Bruce speaks to his fallen friend, who visits him in a dream.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I hear the sound of your guitar</em><br />\n<em>Coming in from the mystic far</em><br />\n<em>The stone and the gravel in your voice</em><br />\n<em>Come in my dreams and I rejoice</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>It&#8217;s your ghost moving through the night</em><br />\n<em>Spirit filled with light</em><br />\n<em>I need you by my side</em><br />\n<em>Your love and I&#8217;m alive</em></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s territory Bruce has trod elsewhere&#8211;even on the same album, in fact. &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/11/26/roll-of-the-dice-ill-see-you-in-my-dreams/\">I&#8217;ll See You in My Dreams</a>&#8221; is essentially a song-length expansion of the first verse of &#8220;Ghosts.&#8221;\u00a0 The notion of ghosts as friendly companions has been part of his private and public musings since at least the passing of Clarence Clemons in 2011.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When you&#8217;re young, you&#8217;re taught that ghosts are frightening,&#8221; Bruce explained to his Vancouver audience in 2012. &#8220;But as you get older, you realize that ghosts and spirits of your lost friends&#8230; have imprinted themselves on your heart. They&#8217;ve become an indelible part of your life. You carry them with you, good spirits everywhere you go.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The hook in &#8220;Ghosts&#8221; is the\u00a0<em>I&#8217;m alive!</em> that leads into the chorus. It&#8217;s a playful contrast to the notion of ghosts and spirits, but it&#8217;s also a primal scream of gratitude, relief, joy, and carpe diem desperation.</p>\n<p>Bruce has always known a good hook when he stumbles on one, but even he couldn&#8217;t have imagined just how much those two words&#8211;<em>I&#8217;m alive!</em>&#8211;would resonate with his audiences by the time they&#8217;d first hear them live, on the tail end of a devastating, years-long pandemic.</p>\n<p>Maybe it&#8217;s the catharsis in those words, but it&#8217;s all too easy to focus all of our attention on them and miss the remainder of the chorus. That&#8217;s where the true haunting begins.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I can feel the blood shiver in my bones</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;m alive and I&#8217;m out here on my own</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;m alive and I&#8217;m coming home</em></p>\n<p>Even as he rejoices, Bruce feels a chill in his bones. He&#8217;s alive, but the rest of his original bandmates aren&#8217;t. (Ordinarily in these essays, I differentiate between the songwriter and his point-of-view character, but &#8220;Ghosts&#8221; is so clearly autobiographical that it seems silly to do so here.)</p>\n<p>He&#8217;s not literally alone. Both in the studio and on stage, he&#8217;s surrounded by musical compadres who have been by his side for fifty years, which makes the three-year lifespan of The Castiles a veritable eyeblink. But he&#8217;s existentially alone, as we all are&#8211;each of us on our own journey.</p>\n<p>The last line of the chorus&#8211;and the song&#8211;reveals the song&#8217;s haunted heart:\u00a0<em>I&#8217;m alive&#8230; and I&#8217;m coming home.</em> This is a singer who knows he&#8217;s next, knows he has far fewer tomorrows than yesterdays, more goodbyes than hellos. The Castiles will reunite soon enough.</p>\n<p>And at this point, his awareness subtly but powerfully transforms the song.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Old buckskin jacket you always wore</em><br />\n<em>Hangs on the back of my bedroom door</em><br />\n<em>Boots and the spurs you used to ride</em><br />\n<em>Click down the hall but never arrive</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Your old Fender Twin from Johnny&#8217;s Music downtown</em><br />\n<em>Still set on 10 to burn this house down</em><br />\n<em>Count the band in then kick into overdrive</em><br />\n<em>By the end of the set we leave no one alive</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Ghosts running through the night</em><br />\n<em>Our spirits filled with light</em><br />\n<em>I need, need you by my side</em><br />\n<em>Your love and I&#8217;m alive</em></p>\n<p>We notice the continued use of spectral imagery: a pair of cowboy boots clicking down the hall is a delightfully spooky, almost Scooby-Doo-ish trope, but it&#8217;s also (we assume) completely apropos for Theiss&#8217; younger self.</p>\n<p>We feel the singer lose himself in memory and reverie:\u00a0<em>burn the house down, kick into overdrive, leave no one alive </em>all sound very much like the utterances of budding, sixteen-year-old, would-be rock and roll stars.</p>\n<p>But perhaps we miss the subtle shift of the second chorus: it&#8217;s no longer\u00a0<em>your</em> ghost but\u00a0<em>our</em> ghosts filled with light, running through the night. It&#8217;s temporary&#8211;ephemeral&#8211;but for a moment, Bruce has one foot in this world and one in the next, which makes the rest of the chorus feel all the more lonely when he rouses to realize:\u00a0\u00a0<em>I&#8217;m out here on my own.</em></p>\n<p>The E Street Band hushes here, so that Bruce might have his final moments of communion with his former bandmates.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I shoulder your Les Paul and finger the fretboard</em><br />\n<em>I make my vows to those who&#8217;ve come before</em><br />\n<em>I turn up the volume, let the spirits be my guide</em><br />\n<em>Meet you brother and sister on the other side</em></p>\n<p>This is where past becomes present. Bruce is deliberately vague in his reference to &#8220;those who&#8217;ve come before.&#8221; It refers to both the musical influences of a high-school guitarist and the fallen comrades of a septuagenarian rock star, allowing the singer a moment of temporal confluence before the final chorus and &#8220;la la&#8221; coda, in which the entire E Street Band join him, playing the roles of ghosts themselves.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"758\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lo5QNcFioZ4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></div>\n<p>Let&#8217;s talk about the band for a moment.</p>\n<p>All the while Bruce relives his Castile days, he&#8217;s surrounded by a track that&#8217;s as E Street as it gets&#8211;toe to toe with &#8220;Livin&#8217; in the Future&#8221; as the 21st-century Springsteen track with the most 20th-century E Street sound.</p>\n<p>With its Mighty Max lead-in and late-song crescendo, jangly guitars, buoyant bassline, Little Steven harmony vocals, delicate piano caesura, and the wait-for-it sax solo that ushers in the most joyful wordless coda in the entire Springsteen catalog, &#8220;Ghosts&#8221; sounds for all the world like it belongs on\u00a0<em>The River</em> rather than\u00a0<em>Letter to You</em>.</p>\n<p>And even that is almost certainly intentional. It&#8217;s as if Bruce is telling us:\u00a0<em>this, too, is ephemeral</em>. We&#8217;re meant to take notice of what&#8217;s taking place before us, because someday they&#8217;ll be ghosts too.</p>\n<p>For years, Bruce would tell interviewers he played for each audience in the belief that it was somebody&#8217;s first show. Today he plays as if it might be his last.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve seen ten shows&#8211;so far&#8211;on this tour, each one unique, indelible and impossible to fully capture on YouTube or streaming audio, and certainly not on social media setlist discussion threads.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"758\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DwkEeHHwnKU?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></div>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"758\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GcTMYrx4deU?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></div>\n<p>To criticize a static setlist or hold up a sign for an obscure favorite is to miss the beauty of a living forest because we&#8217;re searching for our favorite tree.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re fortunate enough to see even a single show this year, take it all in&#8211;from the moment Bruce counts the band in and kicks into overdrive. Feel every beat. Because today, we&#8217;re all alive. Today, we&#8217;re by each other&#8217;s sides. Tomorrow makes no promises.</p>\n<p>And if that sounds too morbid a thought to carry into a rock and roll show, isn&#8217;t that what rock and roll is all about? A joyful noise, an affirmation of life, communion and defiance in the face of all that life tossed at us yesterday and will no doubt hurl our way tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Or as Bruce puts it on stage: &#8220;George&#8217;s death made me realize how important seizing the moment is, living every moment as deeply as you can. That&#8217;s why we get together like this. It&#8217;s to remember we&#8217;re alive.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Remind yourself, like Bruce does:\u00a0<em>I&#8217;m alive!</em></p>\n<p>Someday we&#8217;ll be out there on our own.</p>\n<p><strong>Ghosts<br
