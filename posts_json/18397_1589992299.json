And of course, it plays under the credits of the iconic film&nbsp;<em>Easy Rider.</em></p>\n<p>Yet Bruce didn&#8217;t cover it properly in concert until relatively recently, breaking it out at the very end of the Magic Tour. He picked the right venue, at least: the Harley Davidson 105th Anniversary Festival in Milwaukee. Bruce closed that show with a surprise, an E Street Band premiere of the Steppenwolf classic.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN &quot;Born To Be Wild&quot; HQ 8-30-08 Harley Fest Milwaukee WI 2008\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/F5qtnWWbDDk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>The band would reprise it almost exactly a year later, this time in Santiago de Compostela on the Working on a Dream Tour, in a tighter, more energetic performance (probably because it was much earlier in the set).</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - &quot;Born To Be Wild&quot; - Santiago de Compostela 2009\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3H_i1RPXhG8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>At this point, I&#8217;m sure there are a few hardcore fans ready to set me straight about these being Bruce&#8217;s only two performances of &#8220;Born to Be Wild,&#8221; so to save them the trouble: yes, Bruce is known to have performed it at least twice prior to the Magic Tour.</p>\n<p>One was a guest during a Jackson Browne benefit show in 1994 (no recording circulates); the other was in Oslo toward the end of World Tour 1993, but that performance is really more of a spotlight moment for Bruce&#8217;s roadie Rick &#8220;Chainsaw&#8221; Lapointe, who sings lead vocals throughout.</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAN38fszmJg</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s believed that Bruce may have also played &#8220;Born to Be Wild&#8221; as early as 1968 with his band Child, since the song title circulates on a list of covers that appears to represent the band&#8217;s repertoire at the time. However, there&#8217;s no record of a Child show where it appears on the set list, so the Harley Festival holds the distinction for Bruce&#8217;s lead vocal debut on &#8220;Born to Be Wild.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Born to Be Wild</strong><br />\n<strong>First performed:</strong> June 1, 1993 (Oslo, Norway)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> August 2, 2009 (Santiago De
