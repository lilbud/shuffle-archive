Ostensibly, it&#8217;s a relationship song, and no doubt it had its roots in Springsteen&#8217;s still young relationship with Patti Scialfa.</p>\n<p data-path-to-node=\"5\">But there&#8217;s a meta reading of &#8220;Leap of Faith&#8221; also.\u00a0<em>Human Touch</em>\u00a0 revealed an aimless artist wandering in search of something to say and a sound with which to say it.\u00a0<em>Lucky Town</em>, by contrast, is both sonically and lyrically propulsive. It&#8217;s bright, optimistic, and forward-moving.</p>\n<p data-path-to-node=\"5\">It had something to say.</p>\n<p data-path-to-node=\"5\">And of all the tracks on the album, &#8220;Leap of Faith&#8221; says it most overtly.</p>\n<p data-path-to-node=\"5\">It might be tempting to lump &#8220;Leap of Faith&#8221; in with other &#8220;pulling out of here to win&#8221; songs like &#8220;Thunder Road,&#8221; &#8220;The Promised Land,&#8221; and &#8220;No Surrender.&#8221; But there&#8217;s something different going on here, and element not present in those earlier songs.</p>\n<p data-path-to-node=\"5\">In &#8220;Leap of Faith,&#8221; Bruce introduces\u00a0<em>fear</em>.</p>\n<p data-path-to-node=\"5\">Fear and vulnerability.</p>\n<p data-path-to-node=\"5\">He hides them in a mask of macho bravado (Bruce would grow braver as he moved through middle age), but they&#8217;re there. And with their inclusion, his songbook begins a journey of maturation that would carry him through the next three decades and beyond.</p>\n<p data-path-to-node=\"5\">The track opens with a crisp, snapping rhythm that feels decidedly un-E Street. It\u2019s light, almost jittery, reflecting a man who has shed the heavy work boots of Jersey for a brighter life on the west coast. Ironically, the rest of the arrangement is workman-like, and Bruce sings with desperation is if to distract us from it.</p>\n<p data-path-to-node=\"8\">Lyrically, our narrator is grappling with a fundamental truth he\u2019d been circling since <i data-path-to-node=\"8\" data-index-in-node=\"82\">Tunnel of Love</i>: the difference between <em>falling in love</em> and <em>standing in love</em>.\u00a0The former is passive; the second requires work.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\" data-path-to-node=\"8\"><em>All over the world the rain was pouring</em><br />\n<em>I was scratching where it itched</em><br />\n<em>Oh heartbreak and despair got nothing but boring</em><br />\n<em>So I grabbed you baby like a wild pitch</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>It takes a leap of faith to get things going</em><br />\n<em>It takes a leap of faith you gotta show some guts</em><br />\n<em>It takes a leap of faith to get things going</em><br />\n<em>Yeah, in your heart baby you must trust</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Now your legs were heaven your breasts were the altar</em><br />\n<em>Your body was the holy land</em><br />\n<em>You shouted &#8220;jump&#8221; but my heart faltered</em><br />\n<em>You laughed and said &#8220;Baby don&#8217;t you understand?&#8221;</em></p>\n<p data-path-to-node=\"8\">At first listen, this isn&#8217;t Bruce at his most subtle. His narrator is a randy horndog, whose idea of guts is propositioning a girl he both sexualizes and deifies.</p>\n<p data-path-to-node=\"8\">But the song takes a turn toward the end of the second verse:\u00a0<em>you shouted &#8221;jump&#8221; but my heart faltered</em>.</p>\n<p data-path-to-node=\"8\">Suddenly the song&#8217;s context shifts from carnal to emotional, and our narrator instantly loses his swagger.</p>\n<p data-path-to-node=\"8\">Now comes the bridge:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\" data-path-to-node=\"8\"><em>Now you were the Red Sea I was Moses</em><br />\n<em>I kissed you and slipped into a bed of roses</em><br />\n<em>The waters parted and love rushed inside</em><br />\n<em>I was Jesus&#8217; son yeah sanctified</em></p>\n<p data-path-to-node=\"8\">There aren&#8217;t many (if any) passages in the Springsteen songbook more graphically (if metaphorically) sexual than this, but it succeeds not only in conveying a moment of sexual climax, but emotional as well. It&#8217;s a turning point for our narrator: his lover now represents the gateway to a new and better life of companionship, a moment of true rebirth which Bruce explicitly and uncharacteristically states in the song&#8217;s final passage.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\" data-path-to-node=\"8\"><em>Tonight the moon&#8217;s looking young but I&#8217;m feeling younger</em><br />\n<em>&#8216;Neath a veil of dreams sweet blessings rain</em><br />\n<em>Honey I can feel the first breeze of summer</em><br />\n<em>And in your love I&#8217;m born again</em></p>\n<p data-path-to-node=\"12\">Appropriately, beneath its rock veneer, &#8220;Leap of Faith&#8221; leans into gospel, particularly in its call-and-response chorus. When the backing vocalists (including Patti Scialfa) swell during the chorus, they provide the safety the lyrics promise.</p>\n<p data-path-to-node=\"13\">As much as both <em>Human Touch </em>and <em>Lucky Town</em> are criticized for their arrangements, &#8220;Leap of Fath&#8221; is one song the E Street Band would likely have failed. It doesn&#8217;t need the operatic swell of a Roy Bittan piano (although he&#8217;s there, buried in the mix) or a muscular of a Big Man sax solo.</p>\n<p data-path-to-node=\"13\">It needs a lean, hungry, almost desperate soul treatment, and if it&#8217;s not perfect on the album (it would be better live with his 1992-93 band), it&#8217;s one of the first moments where a fan might of thought: <em>okay, maybe this new direction will work.</em></p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>With it&#8217;s bright, rowdy optimism, &#8220;Leap of Faith&#8221; quickly became a nightly highlight on World Tour 1992. The new band took to it with skills and confidence that continued to grow throughout the tour, perfectly captured in the live performance video they filmed for the song.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"758\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ouWEZPkbznQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></div>\n<p>In the years since, sightings are rare, and it&#8217;s been almost a decade since Bruce last played it\u2013even though the modern-day E Street Band fuses some of the best elements of the 1992-93 band, like gospel choir singers and multiple percussionists.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"758\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ThhW6P23gn4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></div>\n<p>But there have been a pair of occasions that were truly special, where Bruce performed the song acoustically and alone, heightening the normally hidden vulnerability.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"758\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hnCZf7buQLs?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></div>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"758\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lyj-HAE8ets?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></div>\n<p>In later years, Bruce would revisit with greater craft and subtlety the ground he first paved with &#8220;Leap of Faith.&#8221; (See &#8220;I&#8217;ll Work For Your Love&#8221; for example.)</p>\n<p>But we all get better at things in time.
