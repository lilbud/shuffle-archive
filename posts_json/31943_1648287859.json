The film received middling reviews and is arguably most memorable for its soundtrack, which featured songs written by Ry Cooder.</p>\n<p>One of Cooder&#8217;s songs played over both the opening and end credits: a bittersweet ballad called &#8220;Across the Borderline,&#8221; performed by Freddy Fender.</p>\n<div id=\"v-9R60aGa2-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='322' src='https://videopress.com/embed/9R60aGa2?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>&#8220;Across the Borderline&#8221; features such a lovely melody and such uplifting verses (they inspired two of Bruce&#8217;s own songs, &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/09/06/roll-of-the-dice-across-the-border/\">Across the Border</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/01/10/roll-of-the-dice-american-land/\">American Land</a>&#8220;) that it&#8217;s easy to miss the fact that the choruses offer a hard dose of reality.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>When you reach the broken promised land</em><br />\n<em>Every dream slips through your hand</em><br />\n<em>And you know that it&#8217;s too late to change your mind</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&#8216;Cause you&#8217;ve paid the price to come this far</em><br />\n<em>Just to wind up where you are</em><br />\n<em>And you&#8217;re still just across the borderline</em></p>\n<p>At first listen, &#8220;Across the Borderline&#8221; sounds like a strange candidate for offering hope and fortitude. A border is just a line, it seems to say, and the grass on the other side may not be any greener until you water it a good long time.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Across the Borderline\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tECEpWlOWgY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>But that&#8217;s Cooder&#8217;s point: crossing a border may lead you to a better place, but you&#8217;ve still got to work to make it a better life. And understanding that from the start can help you commit or re-commit to making it to the actual promised land.</p>\n<p>So maybe that explains why &#8220;Across the Borderline&#8221; turned up in Bruce Springsteen&#8217;s otherwise romantic-themed set lists during the early days of the Tunnel of Love Tour. He&#8217;d been soundchecking it for a while, but in late April of 1988, Bruce finally added it to the main set, sandwiched by songs about desire and fidelity.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Across The Borderline -.

(Thankfully, they&#8217;re part of Bruce&#8217;s official archive series&#8211;get them <a href=\"https://live.brucespringsteen.net/live-music/0,14250/Bruce-Springsteen-mp3-flac-download-11-16-1990-The-Christic-Shows-at-The-Shrine-Los-Angeles-CA.html\">here</a>.)</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Across the border line Bruce Springsteen w/Jackson Browne &amp; Bonnie Raitt\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lfO6M1pSr1Q?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> Bruce played &#8220;Across the Borderline&#8221; only once more after his 1993 World Tour, in Denver on the Wrecking Ball Tour nineteen years later. With the full E Street Band behind him, he dedicated the song to a woman who told him his music had helped her make it through a hard time. It was an unexpected choice to be sure, but an incredibly moving one as well.
