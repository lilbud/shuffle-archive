Both the tempo change and mid-song instrumental break were devices that Bruce would use upon occasion in those early years, but here he seems to be clearly reaching toward something specific.</p>\n<p>As for the lyrics, well, Bruce&#8217;s early love songs were rarely as layered and nuanced as his later ones, but this one seems like the kind of dream-girl fantasy only a 22-year-old could come up with. Which, of course, was exactly what Bruce was at the time.</p>\n<p>So maybe we can cut him a little slack for writing an entire song about a girl who makes absolutely no demand of her boyfriend other than daily sex, and who apparently has no qualities worth singing about besides that.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well love is a crazy thing</em><br />\n<em>For some woman, it might be a fancy car</em><br />\n<em>Caviar, or maybe a wedding ring</em><br />\n<em>But at night time my baby</em><br />\n<em>It ain&#8217;t none of these things</em><br />\n<em>She gives me love</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>And she&#8217;s not the kind of woman who would put you down</em><br />\n<em>She&#8217;s not the kind of woman who moves around</em><br />\n<em>She do anything that you want her to do</em><br />\n<em>Most of all she let you be like who you got to be</em><br />\n<em>Let you see whoever you got to see</em><br />\n<em>Let you do whatever you got to do</em><br />\n<em>???</em><br />\n<em>Because you know she gives you&#8230;</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Love,\u00a0 its a beautiful thing</em><br />\n<em>Yeah now woman, watch out cause she is a deadly game</em><br />\n<em>But no not my baby</em><br />\n<em>Oh she ain&#8217;t that kind</em><br />\n<em>She&#8217;s sweet, she&#8217;s wonderful, and she&#8217;s my girl</em><br />\n<em>I just love her all the time</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>She not the kind of woman that can ???</em><br />\n<em>She&#8217;s not the kind of woman who always wants to be your boss</em><br />\n<em>She do most anything that you want her to do</em><br />\n<em>Most of all she let you be like who you got to be</em><br />\n<em>Let you see whoever you got to see</em><br />\n<em>Let you do whatever you got to do</em><br />\n<em>???</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Whoa its a crazy thing</em><br />\n<em>Some woman, might be a fancy car</em><br />\n<em>Cadillac or maybe caviar, maybe she wants a wedding ring</em><br />\n<em>But oh not my baby, she don&#8217;t want none of these things</em><br />\n<em>She only wants my love</em><br />\n<em>Oh take it easy, you gotta give her love</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;m saying love, you gotta give her love</em><br />\n<em>Most she wants is love</em><br />\n<em>She wants love</em><br />\n<em>Don&#8217;t you know she wants love</em></p>\n<p>&#8220;Love Is a Crazy Thing&#8221; isn&#8217;t one of Bruce&#8217;s stronger songs from that period, but it was a signpost pointing to greater things to come.</p>\n<p><strong>Love Is a Crazy Thing<br />\nNever recorded</strong><br />\n<strong>Never released</strong><br />\n<strong>First performed:</strong> February 4, 1972 (Richmond, VA)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> February 4, 1972 (Richmond, VA)</p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
