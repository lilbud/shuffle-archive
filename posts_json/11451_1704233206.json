Yeah, that pink Cadillac is definitely a pudendal metaphor. (Don&#8217;t even bring up the Mary Kay connection, please.)</p>\n<p>And that&#8217;s not the only time a pink Caddy shows up as a sexual stand-in. No less than Aretha Franklin gave Bruce a run for his money in most blatant use of the famous car as a vaginal metaphor in her hit, &#8220;Freeway of Love.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Aretha Franklin - Freeway Of Love (Official Music Video)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ip_pjb5_fgA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Knew you&#8217;d be a vision in white</em><br />\n<em>How&#8217;d you get your pants so tight?</em><br />\n<em>Don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re doin&#8217;</em><br />\n<em>But you must be livin&#8217; right, yeah</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Oh, we got some places to see</em><br />\n<em>I brought all the maps with me</em><br />\n<em>So jump right in, it ain&#8217;t no sin</em><br />\n<em>Take a ride in my machine</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>We goin&#8217; ridin&#8217; on the freeway of love</em><br />\n<em>In my pink Cadillac</em></p>\n<p>But I digress.</p>\n<p>Bruce&#8217;s &#8220;Pink Cadillac&#8221; traces its origins to the\u00a0<em>Nebraska\u00a0</em>sessions in 1982. Recording at home, alone, with just his acoustic guitar and a flat, detached vocal, the original demo of &#8220;Pink Cadillac&#8221; sounds a lot creepier than the released version&#8211;at times it&#8217;s almost sinister.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also even more overt than the finished version, which you might not have thought possible. But check out the couplet in the recording below that Bruce dropped from the final version:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>They say Eve tempted Adam with an apple</em><br />\n<em>Ain&#8217;t no way the poor fool went for that</em><br />\n<em>Can you imagine what would have happened if she&#8217;d just stepped back</em><br />\n<em>And showed him her pink Cadillac</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"RARE!

And that&#8217;s as good a segue as any for us to delve into the way he walks that line in the lyrics.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well now you may think I&#8217;m foolish for the foolish things I do</em><br />\n<em>You may wonder how come I love you when you get on my nerves like you do</em><br />\n<em>Well baby you know you bug me, there ain&#8217;t no secret &#8217;bout that</em><br />\n<em>Well come on over here and hug me, baby I&#8217;ll spill the facts</em><br />\n<em>Well honey it ain&#8217;t your money &#8217;cause baby I got plenty of that</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I love you for your pink Cadillac, crushed velvet seats</em><br />\n<em>Riding in the back, oozing down the street</em><br />\n<em>Waving to the girls, feeling out of sight</em><br />\n<em>Spending all my money on a Saturday night</em><br />\n<em>Honey I just wonder what you do there in the back</em><br />\n<em>Of your pink Cadillac, pink Cadillac</em></p>\n<p>Hey, at least the guy&#8217;s honest, right? He doesn&#8217;t particularly care for his girl, but who cares as long as she&#8217;s great in bed.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s take a moment to note Bruce&#8217;s use of the word &#8220;oozing.&#8221; There&#8217;s really no excuse for not realizing what the song is about by the end of the chorus, but to this day, I encounter lifelong, hardcore Springsteen fans who <em>swear\u00a0</em>to me that he&#8217;s singing &#8220;cruising&#8221; and not &#8220;oozing.&#8221; When I make them go back and listen again, their jaws drop. &#8220;Cruising&#8221; is such an obvious, natural verb to use for a car song, that we can&#8217;t help but hear it even if it&#8217;s not what Bruce is singing. But once you notice the &#8220;oozing&#8221; you&#8217;ll never unhear it, and you&#8217;ll never hear &#8220;Pink Cadillac&#8221; as a song about a car again either.</p>\n<p>I digress again.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Pink Cadillac&#8221; is a Bruce Springsteen song, so if it&#8217;s got sex, it&#8217;s gotta have religion, too.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well now way back in the Bible temptation&#8217;s always come along</em><br />\n<em>There&#8217;s always somebody tempting, somebody into doing something they know is wrong</em><br />\n<em>Well they tempt you man with silver and they tempt you sir with gold</em><br />\n<em>And they tempt you with the pleasure that the flesh does surely hold</em><br />\n<em>They say Eve tempted Adam with an apple but man I ain&#8217;t going for that</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I know it was her pink Cadillac, crushed velvet seats</em><br />\n<em>Riding in the back, oozing down the street</em><br />\n<em>Waving to the girls, feeling out of sight</em><br />\n<em>Spending all my money on a Saturday night</em><br />\n<em>Honey I just wonder what it feels like in the back</em><br />\n<em>Of your pink Cadillac, pink Cadillac</em></p>\n<p>This is the section of the song that inspired Bruce&#8217;s tour schtick, and there&#8217;s not much we can add to it that Bruce didn&#8217;t already say himself on a nightly basis.</p>\n<p>But it&#8217;s the song&#8217;s final verse that&#8217;s my favorite. It&#8217;s a serious contender for Bruce&#8217;s funniest lyrics ever, and if he&#8217;d added on another verse or two we might have had a serious contender to Peter Gabriel&#8217;s &#8220;Sledgehammer&#8221; for best song-length penis metaphor.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Now some folks say it&#8217;s too big and uses too much gas</em><br />\n<em>Some folks say it&#8217;s too old and that it goes too fast</em><br />\n<em>But my love is bigger than a Honda, yeah it&#8217;s bigger than a Subaru</em><br />\n<em>Hey man there&#8217;s only one thing and one car that will do</em><br />\n<em>Anyway we don&#8217;t have to drive it, honey we can park it out in back</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>And have a party in your pink Cadillac, crushed velvet seats</em><br />\n<em>Riding in the back, oozing down the street</em><br />\n<em>Waving to the girls, feeling out of sight</em><br />\n<em>Spending all my money on a Saturday night</em><br />\n<em>Honey I just wonder what you do there in the back</em><br />\n<em>Of your pink Cadillac, pink Cadillac</em></p>\n<p>And here we leave it, with one of the slyest references to doing it doggy style in popular music.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Pink Cadillac&#8221; is arguably the raunchiest song in Bruce&#8217;s catalog (&#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/09/15/roll-of-the-dice-red-headed-woman/\">Red Headed Woman</a>&#8221; might give it a run for its money, though), and Bruce seems to instinctively know that the secret to putting the song over is to cut the raunch with shtick. When he resurrected the song with the E Street Band in 2003 after an 18-year absence, he started out tentatively, almost nervously. But around the four-minute mark below, you can almost see him remember &#8220;oh yeah&#8230; the shtick,&#8221; and he immediately loosens up.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Pink Cadillac\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qD5Vythvxig?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;Pink Cadillac&#8221; has made twenty or so appearances in the sixteen years since.

Jerry Lee released his version of &#8220;Pink Cadillac&#8221; a few years later on his 2006 album, <em>Last Man Standing</em>, and I wouldn&#8217;t be the obsessive completist that I am if I ended this essay without drawing your attention to it.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Pink Cadillac   Jerry Lee Lewis and Bruce Springsteen\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ki9JnV9wbBU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><strong>Bonus #2:</strong> The officially released version of &#8220;Pink Cadillac&#8221; includes a fade-out ending, but the unfaded original track escaped into the wild some time ago.
