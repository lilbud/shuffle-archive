(At least Ronstadt earned a Grammy for her performance.)</p>\n<p>But even if &#8220;I Can&#8217;t Help It&#8221; didn&#8217;t add to Williams&#8217; impressive collection of #1 country singles,\u00a0 it still carries special significance for fans and historians: It&#8217;s one of the very few songs Williams ever performed on television, and footage from his April 1952 performance with Anita Carter from the <em>Kate Smith Evening Hour</em>\u00a0 survives in remarkable condition.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Hank Williams-I Can&#039;t Help It in

Williams&#8217; music, and while his music didn&#8217;t appear often in Bruce&#8217;s Darkness Tour set lists, Bruce often pulled out one or two (or three) of Hank&#8217;s songs during sound checks.</p>\n<p>Before their Passaic show on September 20, 1978, Bruce decided to lead the band through a impromptu cover of &#8220;I Can&#8217;t Help It (If I&#8217;m Still in Love With You).&#8221; It was brief, but the band was earnest&#8211;particularly Roy, whose zeal on a particular flourish momentarily cracked Bruce up.</p>\n<div id=\"v-iBOvmzCQ-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe
