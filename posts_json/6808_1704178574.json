Most Americans don&#8217;t realize that the signature song of their beloved summer pastime includes verses as well, but to hear them you&#8217;ll have to go back a few years.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the original, very first audio recording of &#8220;Take Me Out to the Ball Game,&#8221; recorded by Harvey Hindermeyer in 1908.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Take Me out to the Ballgame [1908]\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hb1W2Cdi4H8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>The song became an instant hit upon its release and was one of the most popular songs of 1908.</p>\n<p>And while Bruce never recorded a cover of it in the studio, we can at least get a taste of what it <em>might</em> have sounded like if he did: in 1982, Baltimore journalist/cartoonist Tom Chalkley and his friend Craig Hanken wondered &#8220;What if Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band had performed &#8216;Take Me Out to the Ball Game?&#8221;\u00a0 They answered their own question by recording it themselves.
