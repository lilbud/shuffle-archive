It peaked at #3 but had such staying power that Billboard ranked it #1 for the entire year. Curiously, though, its radio popularity didn&#8217;t translate to record sales; &#8220;Surfin&#8217; U.S.A.&#8221; has never been awarded gold record status.</p>\n<p>Bruce has often cited The Beach Boys as a musical influence, but although he&#8217;d crossed paths with the band a few times in the early days, he never performed with Brian or the band on stage.</p>\n<p>Until July 1, 2015, that is.</p>\n<p>That night, Brian Wilson played the PNC Bank Arts Center in Holmdel, New Jersey, and Bruce came out to catch the show. Brian called Bruce to the stage during the encores, and although Bruce did his best at first to linger in the background, Brian was having none of it.</p>\n<p>At the end of &#8220;Barbara Ann,&#8221; Brian beckoned Bruce front and center, and Bruce obliged. A little awkwardly at first, Bruce provided backing vocals and hand claps on &#8220;Surfin&#8217; U.S.A.&#8221; but once he strapped on a guitar, any reservations were gone, much to the delight of the hometown crowd.</p>\n<p>Check out that performance below&#8211;&#8220;Surfin&#8217; U.S.A.&#8221; starts around the one-minute mark.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"758\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cFUsZHWVB1M?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></div>\n<p><strong>Surfin&#8217; U.S.A.<br />\nFirst performed:</strong> July 1, 2015 (Holmdel, NJ)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> July 1, 2015 (Holmdel, NJ)</p>\n<p>\u00a9 June 3, 2019</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>One time only: Bruce becomes an honorary Beach Boy when he joins Brian Wilson on stage for &#8220;Surfin&#8217; U.S.A.&#8221;</p>\n", "protected": false}, "author": 1, "featured_media": 67934, "comment_status": "open", "ping_status": "open", "sticky": false, "template": "", "format": "standard", "meta": {"_monsterinsights_skip_tracking": false, "_monsterinsights_sitenote_active": false, "_monsterinsights_sitenote_note": "", "_monsterinsights_sitenote_category": 0, "jetpack_post_was_ever_published": false, "_jetpack_newsletter_access": "", "_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs": false, "_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id": 0, "_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content": false, "_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content": false, "footnotes": "", "jetpack_publicize_message": "", "jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled": true, "jetpack_social_post_already_shared": true, "jetpack_social_options": {"image_generator_settings": {"template": "highway", "default_image_id": 0, "font": "", "enabled": false}, "version": 2}}, "categories": [4, 3612, 5], "tags": [936, 2353, 2352], "class_list": ["post-10184", "post", "type-post", "status-publish", "format-standard", "has-post-thumbnail", "hentry", "category-cover-me", "category-great", "category-meeting-across-the-river", "tag-brian-wilson", "tag-surfin-u-s-a", "tag-the-beach-boys"], "aioseo_notices": [], "jetpack_publicize_connections": [], "jetpack_featured_media_url": "https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/admin-ajax-26.jpg?fit=1000%2C1010&ssl=1", "jetpack_sharing_enabled": true, "jetpack_shortlink": "https://wp.me/p9w3Lk-2Eg", "jetpack_likes_enabled": true, "jetpack-related-posts": [{"id": 57558, "url": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2025/07/01/kingdom-of-days-july-1-2/", "url_meta": {"origin": 10184, "position": 0}, "title": "Kingdom of Days: July 1", "author": "Ken", "date": "July 1, 2025", "format": false, "excerpt": "The Born in the U.S.A.
