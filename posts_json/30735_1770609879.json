Both as frontman for his eponymous band and rhythm guitarist for Bon Jovi, O&#8217;Ree has torn it up on stages around the world.</p>\n<p>But sometimes a musician needs more than a touring income to make a living, so O&#8217;Ree teaches private guitar lessons, too. Back in 2013, one of Matt&#8217;s students brought a nineteen-year-old friend named Sam with him to his lesson, and Sam and Matt hit it off.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Halfway through the lesson it dawned on me that this kid looked familiar,&#8221; O&#8217;Ree told Chris Jordan in an\u00a0<em>Asbury Park Press</em> interview. He soon realized that Sam&#8217;s last name was Springsteen, and soon after that, the elder Springsteen asked O&#8217;Ree if he would teach his son to play guitar.</p>\n<p>Matt took Sam on as a student, and one day Sam asked his teacher if he could hear some of the tracks he was working on. Matt gave Sam a tape, and the tape made its way to Sam&#8217;s father.</p>\n<p>The next time Bruce saw O&#8217;Ree, he commented that he liked one of the songs he&#8217;d heard on the tape. &#8220;Black Boots&#8221; is a song by a rocker for a rocker. The titular boots are the performer&#8217;s totem: when he pulls on those boots, the stage persona takes hold.</p>\n<p>That compliment was &#8220;a defining moment for me,&#8221; O&#8217;Ree said in a 2016 press release, &#8220;and with every ounce of courage I had, I asked Bruce if he would be interested in playing on it. With a pause he thought for a second, and then said, &#8216;Sure. Let me see what I can add to it.&#8217; All I remember were overwhelming feelings of joy running through me. One incredible moment in an otherwise average day for a kid from Holmdel.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Bruce end up contributing lead vocals and a screaming guitar solo, and the finished duet track was released as the lead single to O&#8217;Ree&#8217;s 2016 album, <em>Brotherhood.</em></p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"758\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BLMLUdyYhMo?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></div>\n<p>&#8220;Black Boots&#8221; is a scorcher, featuring strong vocal performances from both Bruce and Matt and some serious shredding.
