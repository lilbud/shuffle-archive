Contrary to popular belief, the titular Mary is not the mother of Jesus; nor is it Mary Magdalene. The song refers to Mary of Bethany, who grieved with Jesus over the death of her brother Lazarus. (Many versions of the song refer to Mary&#8217;s sister Martha also.) Moved by Mary&#8217;s grief, Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead.</p>\n<p>Blended with the story of Exodus and the tale of the Great Flood, &#8220;O Mary Don&#8217;t You Weep&#8221; is full of coded messages to an enslaved people: <em>Don&#8217;t weep, don&#8217;t mourn,</em> because God will help. Justice is coming (<em>Pharoah&#8217;s army got drowned-ed. No more water but fire next time</em>). You will be free: <em>There&#8217;ll be good times by and by</em>.</p>\n<p>No one knows who first wrote it, but it almost doesn&#8217;t matter so often have its lyrics changed. No one knows who first sang it, and it&#8217;s almost impossible to catalog all the recordings.</p>\n<p>African-American communities and congregations kept &#8220;O Mary Don&#8217;t You Weep&#8221; alive after the Civil War until the advent of recording technology. The first known recording dates to 1915 by the Fisk Jubilee Singers, which establishes the traditional melody and familiar lyrics.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"O Mary, Don&#039;t You Weep, Don&#039;t You Mourn\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3ARzwv_xgmc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>More than a decade later, the Georgia Field Hands performed the first known version to be filmed and preserved.

Contemporary artists began interpreting and re-arranging the traditional spiritual. Two versions in particular captured popular attention. The first was a radically revamped gospel version by The Caravans in 1958.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Mary, Don&#039;t You Weep\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/l4IUg_GWFVo?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>The second and most famous recording was by The Swan Silvertones in 1959, who recast the spiritual in a catchy doo-wop arrangement that became a hit for the group and inspired Paul Simon to write &#8220;Bridge Over Troubled Water&#8221; with their improvised line, &#8220;I\u2019ll be your bridge over deep water if you trust in my name, Mary.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"The Swan Silvertones-Oh Mary Don&#039;t You Weep\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/d4hdWcxa0lQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>The floodgates were now open, and creative interpretations poured forth.

Back then, he thought he was only recording a single song (the title track) for a Seeger tribute anthology project. But one song became six when he assembled a group of musicians at his house&#8211;not enough for an album but too much to throw away.</p>\n<p>Those six folk songs lodged themselves in the back of Bruce&#8217;s mind for almost a decade after, until he recalled the same musicians for a second Seeger Session shortly before embarking on his 2005 solo acoustic tour.</p>\n<p>The ensemble recorded nine songs that day, eight of which ended up on the album, including &#8220;O Mary Don&#8217;t You Weep.&#8221; The recording session was captured on video&#8211;unrehearsed and arranged on the fly by Bruce, who (like all of the players) looks like he&#8217;s having a blast. (The clip is edited, however, as both Bruce and Charlie contribute multiple instruments which almost certainly means overdubs were applied.)</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - O Mary Don&#039;t You Weep (The Seeger Sessions)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tebjshm7f_I?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>The video is also a full minute longer than the abridged version on the album, which makes this (to my mind) the definitive version of the track. Brassy, loose, even a bit sloppy (it was unrehearsed, remember), Bruce&#8217;s arrangement of &#8220;O Mary Don&#8217;t You Weep&#8221; had a New Orleans feel to it, which made it the perfect number to kick off his instantly legendary Jazz Fest show (and the Seeger Sessions Tour itself) back in 2006.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Introduction/O Mary Don&#039;t You Weep (Live at the New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival, 2...\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2J4kzl1LPVA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>It would lose its position as show opener before long, but it would remain one of a core group of songs that would be performed at every single Sessions Band show, right up until the last stand in Ireland.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen with the Sessions Band - O Mary Don&#039;t You Weep (Live In Dublin)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eSBf_mpO9Yw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>It was also one of the few Seeger Sessions songs to make the leap to the E Street stage, making cameo appearances in encore Jazz Fest appearances in 2012 and 2014.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - O Mary Don&#039;t You Weep - New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival - 4/29/12\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eCM2ykqSCXc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Bruce even performed it at a mini-reunion of the Sessions Band in 2015.
