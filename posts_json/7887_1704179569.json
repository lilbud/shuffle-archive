Take a listen to that performance below, and pay attention to the lyrics: this younger version of Frankie is harder, faster, and more cynical than the lush, romantic version we&#8217;d come to know later. That gorgeous riff is instantly recognizable, though, as is that lush, sudden sax-laden coda&#8211;Frankie&#8217;s signature would never change.</p>\n<div id=\"v-LmknH3DW-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='426' src='https://videopress.com/embed/LmknH3DW?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>It&#8217;s remarkable, isn&#8217;t it, how recognizable this version of &#8220;Frankie&#8221; is, yet at the same time so very different. Let&#8217;s take a deeper look:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Dark weekends in the sun, out on Chelsea Road</em><br />\n<em>Descending the stairs, Frankie my love</em><br />\n<em>Check your make-up in the mirror, come on, baby, let&#8217;s go</em><br />\n<em>We&#8217;ll dance &#8217;round this dirty town, &#8217;till the night is all gone</em><br />\n<em>Let all the finer things sleep alone tonight</em><br />\n<em>Let all the minor kings lose their thrones tonight</em><br />\n<em>Don&#8217;t worry about me baby, I&#8217;ll be alright</em></p>\n<p>This first verse is almost identical to the released version. The imagery and metaphor are identical (including, thankfully, that wonderful &#8220;minor kings&#8221; notion), and the few wording changes are minor. The final one, though, is significant and symbolic of Frankie&#8217;s journey to come: Bruce tells Frankie not to worry about <em>him</em>, because\u00a0<em>he&#8217;ll\u00a0</em>be alright. Six years later, they&#8217;d be a team, and he&#8217;d sing &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about <em>us</em>, baby, <em>we&#8217;ll</em> be alright.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In the second verse, the divergence becomes more obvious. In this version, Bruce sings:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>There&#8217;s machines and there&#8217;s fire on the outside of town</em><br />\n<em>Young boys for hire waiting to blow us all down</em><br />\n<em>There are strange flashes in the sky up above</em></p>\n<p>That&#8217;s some impressionistic imagery there (and yes, that first line would end up in &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/02/27/roll-of-the-dice-drive-all-night/\">Drive All Night</a>&#8221; five years later); Bruce paints a gritty street scene as backdrop for the lovers. Six years later, the song would instead be set against a town dying a slow economic death. (It would be easy, in fact, to imagine the 1982 version of Frankie set in the same place is &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/04/09/roll-of-the-dice-my-hometown/\">My Hometown</a>.&#8221;)</p>\n<p>In both versions, though, Bruce takes his time painting a stark backdrop so he can play up his hero&#8217;s romance in the foreground, and when his lyrics open up, we feel our hearts open, too:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I&#8217;ll spend the night at the movies with my secret love</em><br />\n<em>At dusk the stars all appear on the screen</em><br />\n<em>Just like they do each night in my dreams</em><br />\n<em>But tonight&#8217;s no dream, Frankie, I can feel myself too</em><br />\n<em>Living and dying like I was born to do</em></p>\n<p>In 1982, Bruce wouldn&#8217;t keep his love secret. He was a lot less self-centered, too: instead of &#8220;living and dying like I was born to do&#8221; he&#8217;s sing &#8220;now and forever, baby, my love is for you.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The first chorus is mostly the same in each version. In 1976, Bruce sings:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Walk softly tonight little angel</em><br />\n<em>I wanna be alone with you</em><br />\n<em>Talk softly to me tonight angel</em><br />\n<em>Make all my dream worlds come true</em></p>\n<p>In 1982, Bruce again shifts the focus away from the narrator and on to the pair: instead of &#8220;I wanna be alone with you,&#8221; he notes that &#8220;into these shadows we&#8217;re passing through.&#8221;</p>\n<p>That third and final verse though&#8230; boy, that early version is dark:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I remember standing in the freezing rain</em><br />\n<em>Reading them want ads out on Chelsea Row</em><br />\n<em>Winging down the street in search of new games</em><br />\n<em>Hustling through the night packs where the actors go</em><br />\n<em>Frankie they&#8217;re real crazy, let&#8217;s run and hide</em><br />\n<em>In the darkness there&#8217;ll be hidden worlds that shine</em><br />\n<em>When all of the fury in this desperate land</em><br />\n<em>Will rise like raindrops in the palm of my hand</em></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also somewhat familiar&#8211;when I listen to this version of &#8220;Frankie&#8221; and reach this point, I feel as if I&#8217;m back in the world of &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/12/14/roll-of-the-dice-incident-on-57th-street/\">Incident on 57th Street.</a>&#8221; Our narrator could easily pass for Spanish Johnny, and our lovers&#8217; shining, hidden world of the street (Bruce would rescue that imagery for &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/05/02/roll-of-the-dice-candys-room/\">Candy&#8217;s Room</a>&#8220;) feels like the very same streets of &#8220;Incident,&#8221; the romance of two not-so-innocent lovers falling in love against a seedy, seamy backdrop.</p>\n<p>If the theme and setting are tried and true, however, Bruce&#8217;s skill with imagery and metaphor has grown rapidly in the not-even-three years that separates the songs. That final line&#8211;&#8220;when all of the fury in this desperate land will rise like raindrops in the palm of my hand&#8221;&#8211;is just beautiful. And even those raindrops are a metaphor inside of a metaphor, as we realize when Bruce improvs a few lines that implore Frankie to let her sadness rise.</p>\n<p>So yes, this early incarnation of Frankie is melodramatic and self-centered, but gloriously so, as the fires of youth should be.</p>\n<p>Oh, and if there&#8217;s any doubt about just how far the similarities go between Frankie and her unnamed beau compared with Puerto Rican Jane and Spanish Johnny, listen to Bruce and the E Street Band working on &#8220;Frankie&#8221; in the studio a year later, on June 3, 1977. Bruce bluffs much of the lyrics, but the first verse is complete and a few lines jump out at us in their starkness:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen Frankie\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/e7hsSFnJ1Og?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Yes, we heard that right: instead of&#8230;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Let all the finer things sleep alone tonight</em><br />\n<em>Let all the minor kings lose their thrones tonight</em><br />\n<em>Don&#8217;t worry about us, baby, we&#8217;ll be alright</em></p>\n<p>Bruce sings:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Tricks are all over with plenty of time</em><br />\n<em>The dicks are all covered, straight down the line</em><br />\n<em>There goes Frankie, she&#8217;s not that kind</em></p>\n<p>&#8230;which gives us some brutal insight into those night packs we hear about in that original early version.</p>\n<p>By the time Bruce recorded that demo in 1977, he&#8217;d come out the other side of long legal\u00a0battle with former manager Mike Appel, and by that time Bruce was in a much darker vein for a bright star like &#8220;Frankie.&#8221; Bruce&#8217;s songwriting imagery had grown increasingly dark, stark, and almost nihilistic, but despite what we just heard, Frankie proved too seductive to allow her creator to soften her shine.</p>\n<p>So into the vault she went, but Bruce couldn&#8217;t quite quit her. During the Born in the U.S.A. sessions, he&#8217;d try one more time to rescue her from obscurity, and although it never made that album either, this is the version Bruce eventually released sixteen years later on <em>Tracks</em>.</p>\n<p>Besides maturing into a more selfless romance, this version of &#8220;Frankie&#8221; features one of the E Street Band&#8217;s finest moments in the studio. Listen to the band in their full glory&#8211;especially that coda:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Frankie (Studio Outtake - 1982)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/H2EP5pdIYpY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Besides the other lyrical differences we noted earlier, Bruce has significantly scrubbed and softened the final verse:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well lately I&#8217;ve been standing out in the freezing rain</em><br />\n<em>Reading them want ads out on Chelsea Road</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;m winging down the street in search of new games</em><br />\n<em>Hustling through these nightlights&#8217; diamond glow</em><br />\n<em>Well Frankie I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m gonna find</em><br />\n<em>Maybe nothing at all, maybe a world I can call mine</em><br />\n<em>Shining like these streetlights down here on the strand</em><br />\n<em>Bright as the rain in the palm of your hand</em></p>\n<p>All traces of 57th Street have been erased, and the focus is on our characters, as it should be. This new backdrop is much brighter than the old one, literally: the nightlights glow like diamonds, the streetlights shine, the rain is bright. Bruce does nothing by accident; this is Bruce&#8217;s deliberate (if unsubtle) attempt to lighten the weight of the song and imbue the main characters&#8217; love with a fiery passion.</p>\n<p>And all through the years, the coda remains true, with Bruce pleading:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Walk softly tonight, little stranger</em><br />\n<em>Into these shadows where lovers go</em><br />\n<em>Talk softly to me, little angel</em><br />\n<em>Whisper your secrets so soft and low</em></p>\n<p>&#8230;as he and Frankie find a haven on the streets, no matter how dark or light they may be.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Bruce performed &#8220;Frankie&#8221; so frequently in April 1976 that fans who witnessed it must have been certain it was destined for his next album. &#8220;Frankie&#8221; is lush, long, romantic, and has that &#8220;epic&#8221; sweep that&#8217;s hard to define but which clearly includes songs like &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/05/14/roll-of-the-dice-backstreets/\">Backstreets</a>,&#8221; &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/10/03/roll-of-the-dice-racing-in-the-street/\">Racing in the Street</a>,&#8221; &#8220;Jungleland,&#8221; and &#8220;Incident on 57th Street&#8221; in scope and grandeur.</p>\n<p>But it wasn&#8217;t to be.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Frankie&#8221; disappeared from sight after April 24, 1976, even though we know that Bruce continued to revisit the song in the studio for at least the next six years. &#8220;Frankie&#8221; wasn&#8217;t seen again for 23 years, in fact&#8211;until the night of August 9, 1999, when Bruce strode to the microphone and said, &#8220;This is for you aficionados out there&#8230;&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Frankie Bruce Springsteen New Jersey August 9, 1999\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zJN-z0HPSFk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>It was an unexpected but beautiful performance (even if the band didn&#8217;t quite know how to end it).</p>\n<p>In the two decades since, &#8220;Frankie&#8221; has come out only a baker&#8217;s dozen times (of which I&#8217;ve somehow and amazingly been fortunate enough to catch four!). Only Bruce can say why, but I suspect it has a lot to do with the perfection of the studio recording. &#8220;Frankie&#8221; is one of the rare songs that the E Street Band has been unable to improve upon in concert, although on one particular night at Fenway Park in 2012, they came pretty darn close, thanks to a gorgeous new introduction, a mid-song story, and some impromptu summer firefly ambiance provided by an enthralled, appreciative crowd.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen Frankie\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YNzk7_P-qtc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Magic. Just magic.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Bonus #1: &#8220;Frankie&#8221; came out a few times on Bruce&#8217;s 2005 solo acoustic tour. I wouldn&#8217;t count any of them among Bruce&#8217;s best performances, but they&#8217;re unusual enough to warrant watching.

Very, very close to the released version, this one is notable for Clarence&#8217;s absence in the coda.
