And their sound&#8230; let&#8217;s just say it could be a bit busy.</p>\n<p>Take &#8220;Lady of Boston&#8221; for instance&#8211;a song that Bruce only performed at these Dr. Zoom shows. Listening to this remarkably clear fifty-year-old recording, it&#8217;s easy to understand why.</p>\n<div id=\"v-9foQlpoG-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='568' src='https://videopress.com/embed/9foQlpoG?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>Once we get past the jarring freestyle wind-up, the band quickly settles into a familiar Steel Mill-ish groove. (Bruce hadn&#8217;t fully left that sound behind yet despite his efforts.)\u00a0In fact, the body of &#8220;Lady of Boston&#8221; has such a strong Steel Mill sound to it that it&#8217;s almost startling when we hear Albee Tellone&#8217;s tenor sax decorating key lines.</p>\n<p>Lyrically, &#8220;Lady of Boston&#8221; underwhelms. About the only thing worth noting from a historical perspective is its thematic similarity to Bruce&#8217;s later song, &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/09/24/roll-of-the-dice-thundercrack/\">Thundercrack</a>.&#8221; Both songs are odes to seductive dancers, and the second verse of the former features a line with a striking similarity to one that would show up in the latter.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I got a lady in Boston, she&#8217;s outta sight</em><br />\n<em>When I get up into Massachusetts, she keep me company every night</em><br />\n<em>Well she&#8217;s mean and she hits you like a Kansas twister\u00a0</em><br />\n<em>She&#8217;s a solid gold, genuine, bona fide, super soul sister</em><br />\n<em>Well I don&#8217;t want her money, ain&#8217;t no money that satisfies</em><br />\n<em>All I want is your loving, Great god almighty she got the lord on her side</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>See her every Friday night down at the disco scene\u00a0</em><br />\n<strong><em>When she gets out on the floor everybody moves, she&#8217;s so clean</em></strong><br />\n<em>You know she&#8217;s so heavenly, all a man wants to do is just hold her</em><br />\n<em>And I tell you there ain&#8217;t no other woman on earth, there just ain&#8217;t nobody bolder</em><br />\n<em>Now I don&#8217;t care about her bankbook &#8217;cause Sally&#8217;s what satisfies</em><br />\n<em>All I want is her loving Great god almighty she got the lord on her side</em></p>\n<p>The instrumental break, however, does not underwhelm. It&#8217;s very, um, whelming. For the first two minutes, the Sonic Boom members just sort of do their own thing, at times in a painfully discordant fashion.\u00a0That&#8217;s followed by a two-minute movement clearly designed to spotlight Bruce&#8217;s blisteringly fast guitar playing. (If anything impresses about &#8220;Lady of Boston,&#8221; it&#8217;s Bruce&#8217;s jaw-dropping guitar dexterity.)</p>\n<p>A tempo change signals a shift to the song&#8217;s final movement, which sounds like Bruce just decided he needed to put words to the riff.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>It&#8217;s a funny and a hurting &#8217;cause things ain&#8217;t right</em><br />\n<em>Try bake it, try to bomb, maybe start a fight</em><br />\n<em>But your friends don&#8217;t wanna know you</em><br />\n<em>They just pass you by</em><br />\n<em>But they couldn&#8217;t be your friends</em><br />\n<em>&#8216;Cause they wouldn&#8217;t lie</em><br />\n<em>So sit down shut up don&#8217;t you cry</em><br />\n<em>&#8216;Cause things will get better if you really try</em><br />\n<em>So don&#8217;t you panic, don&#8217;t you panic give it one more try</em><br />\n<em>Don&#8217;t you panic, don&#8217;t you panic give it one more try</em><br />\n<em>Keep on trying!</em></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not clear to me that these lyrics have any connection to the ones that preceded them, unless it&#8217;s a clumsy fast-forward to a relationship on the rocks. Given the abrupt fade-out that ends the track, I sometimes wonder whether the band had actually segued into a different song by this point.</p>\n<p>The fact that I still can&#8217;t tell if &#8220;Lady of Boston&#8221; is an incomplete song, an intact song, or a two-song mash-up speaks to the incoherence of the piece&#8211;a stylistic choice in keeping with the band&#8217;s on-stage presentation. Neither style lasted long, thankfully.</p>\n<p>In the end both Dr. Zoom and the Sonic Boom and &#8220;Lady of Boston&#8221; are historical footnotes, transitional steps on Bruce&#8217;s journey toward his own musical sound.</p>\n<p><strong>Lady of Boston<br />\nNever recorded</strong><br />\n<strong>Never released</strong><br />\n<strong>First performed:</strong> May 15, 1971 (Union, NJ)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> May 15, 1971 (Union, NJ)</p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
