It never appealed to me, doing a whole night of \u00a0covers&#8230; So I had been working on Chain Smokin\u2019 for a while, and I just thought it was a really good song.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Joe&#8217;s being modest&#8211;&#8220;Chain Smokin'&#8221; is a <em>great</em> song. Thematically, it owes more than a little to Prince&#8217;s &#8220;Nothing Compares 2 U&#8221; from a decade prior (made famous by Sinead O&#8217;Connor in her 1989 cover), and there are even some lyrical similarities.</p>\n<p>But whereas Prince&#8217;s song dials up the melodrama, &#8220;Chain Smokin'&#8221; takes a much subtler approach to illustrating the relationship withdrawal that follows a messy break-up. Musically and lyrically, &#8220;Chain Smokin'&#8221; broods and simmers and obsesses just like its narrator does. The entire song contains only about six unique lines, but that&#8217;s what makes it so powerful.</p>\n<p>Joe used &#8220;Chain Smokin'&#8221; as the springboard for his next album, enlisting his friend Bruce to help him create it. They recorded it in Bruce&#8217;s studio in Los Angeles in late 1993, with Bruce contributing his guitar and prominent backing vocals throughout&#8211;their very first studio collaboration.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"758\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8wQfzwQSSAU?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></div>\n<p>Joe and Bruce have played &#8220;Chain Smokin'&#8221; together several times over the years, including a half-dozen performances during Joe&#8217;s legendary October Assault mini-tour in the autumn of 1995, which featured Bruce as an honorary Houserocker.</p>\n<p>Joe fortuitously had their hometown show at Nick&#8217;s Fat City in Pittsburgh recorded, and he released it as a bonus disc with his DVD biography,\u00a0<em>A Good Life: The Joe Grushecky Story. </em>Among their great performances that night was a smoldering version of &#8220;Chain Smokin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>\n<audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-27045-2\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/03-Chain-Smoking.mp3?_=2\" /><a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/03-Chain-Smoking.mp3\">https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/03-Chain-Smoking.mp3</a></audio>\n<p>Bruce and Joe have only played it together twice more since their 1995 tour together, but &#8220;Chain Smokin'&#8221; remains a fan and artist favorite.
