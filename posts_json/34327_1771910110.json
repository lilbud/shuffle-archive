Seeger agreed, performing his new song for Barone on the spot over the phone.</p>\n<p>After the concert, Barone produced a recording of &#8220;God&#8217;s Counting on Me&#8230; God&#8217;s Counting on You&#8221; performed while sailing on the Hudson River Sloop Clearwater, with both Seeger and Wyatt on vocals.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"758\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cvnsB_kVNYI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></div>\n<p>(There&#8217;s a fascinating Tape Op interview with Barone in which he describes in much detail the recording process and experience&#8211;I highly recommend reading it if you&#8217;re interested.)</p>\n<p class=\"text-justify\">Seeger and Barone decided to release the track as a single through Appleseed records, but there was enough traffic on the label&#8217;s release runway to delay the song&#8217;s release until 2012. In the meantime, Appleseed had Bruce Springsteen contribute vocals to the track in January 2012, and he can be heard prominently singing lead on two verses of the final track below.</p>\n<div
