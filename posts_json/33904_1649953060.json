When they decided to record &#8220;Double Shot&#8221; in the studio, however, they quickly grew frustrated at their inability to capture the energy of their live performances.</p>\n<p>The Medallions solved their problem by turning their studio session into a live performance. &#8220;We actually pulled in people off the street and had a big crowd in the studio to make background noise,&#8221; lead singer John McElrath told <em>Rebeat Magazine,\u00a0</em>&#8220;and that party atmosphere gave us the sound we were looking for.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"SWINGIN&#039; MEDALLIONS-&quot;DOUBLE SHOT OF MY BABY&#039;S LOVE&quot;(LYRICS)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/57s89xrC93o?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>The Medallions&#8217; version of &#8220;Double Shot&#8221; became an immediate local hit, and it soon became clear that it was going to have legs beyond the area as well.

No recording is known to exist of that live debut, but a couple weeks later, Bruce covered it in concert proper in South Bend, Indiana.
