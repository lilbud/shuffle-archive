(I suspect the latter song had its genesis during the <em>Tunnel of Love</em> period, though.) Why take another swing (and so soon) after hitting a home run on the first pitch?</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not just the thematic similarity&#8211;there are lyrical echoes of &#8220;Brilliant Disguise&#8221; throughout &#8220;Leavin&#8217; Train&#8221; starting from the very first lines.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Baby when I ask you if everything is alright</em><br />\n<em>You whisper &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry&#8221; and you shut out the light</em><br />\n<em>Well now black is black in this bed we&#8217;re laying</em><br />\n<em>Yeah and I wanna believe the words yeah that your lips are saying</em></p>\n<p>Compare the first couplet above with this key passage in &#8220;Brilliant Disguise&#8221;:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Now look at me baby, struggling to do everything right</em><br />\n<em>And then it all falls apart oh when out go the lights</em></p>\n<p>See what I mean? And it continues from there. Compare the third line with:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Tonight our bed is cold, I&#8217;m lost in the darkness of our love</em></p>\n<p>Now I will admit that the notion of a departing train is much more specific and evocative metaphor than a generic disguise (however brilliant), but Bruce fumbles the follow-through:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Whoa but your eyes look like a leavin&#8217; train</em><br />\n<em>Yeah they keep on dragging me down</em><br />\n<em>Your eyes look like a leavin&#8217; train</em><br />\n<em>They keep on draggin&#8217;</em><br />\n<em>They keep on draggin&#8217;</em><br />\n<em>They keep on draggin&#8217; me down</em></p>\n<p>Since when do trains drag\u00a0<em>down</em>? I&#8217;m not sure what exactly I would have used here instead (I&#8217;m no songwriter), but &#8220;leavin&#8217; train&#8221; and &#8220;draggin&#8217; down&#8221; don&#8217;t really work together. One implies abandonment and the other imprisonment.</p>\n<p>I suppose we could just ignore the train metaphor altogether and simply focus on the narrator being dragged down by his lover&#8217;s eyes. That conceit works nicely. So much so, in fact, that Bruce had a Top Ten hit with it in 1985:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well lately when I look into your eyes</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;m going down, down, down, down</em></p>\n<p>&#8220;Leavin&#8217; Train&#8221; adds nothing original to Bruce&#8217;s catalog.\u00a0 The second verse again retreads &#8220;Brilliant Disguise&#8221; territory:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well I did anything just to try to get close to you</em><br />\n<em>I took it step by step yeah like a man&#8217;s supposed to</em><br />\n<em>Tell me now, is this my, baby, is this my contrition</em><br />\n<em>To have the love that I longed for fill me with suspicion</em></p>\n<p>And the last verse is lackluster even without comparison:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>So now it&#8217;s tellin&#8217; time, oh my little sister</em><br />\n<em>Now can I believe the words, the words of love you whisper</em><br />\n<em>Is my train in vain, oh has my soul gone to waste</em><br />\n<em>Am I just a victim of, a victim of my lost faith</em></p>\n<p><em>Train in vain?</em>\u00a0 When did the train become the narrator&#8217;s? And what&#8217;s the point of establishing a secondary use of the metaphor but doing absolutely nothing with it besides an easy internal rhyme? And why reach for a lone internal rhyme but go lazy on the external ones? It almost sounds like Bruce just lost interest in the song at this point.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, though, the last five lines of &#8220;Leavin&#8217; Train'&#8221; cannot hold a candle to the devastating&#8230;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>God have mercy on the man who doubts what he&#8217;s sure of</em></p>\n<p>&#8230;even though they&#8217;re conveying the exact same thing.</p>\n<p>So yeah, Bruce made a wise move relegating &#8220;Leavin&#8217; Train&#8221; to outtake status (at least until he released it in 1998 on <em>Tracks</em>), of interest only to ZZ Top fans who are curious to hear what that band&#8217;s material might sound like in Bruce&#8217;s hands.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Leavin&#8217; Train&#8221; is a song I never would have expected Bruce\u00a0 to break out in concert, but surprisingly he did: twice in fact, with Joe Grushecky and The Houserockers on back-to-back nights in Pittsburgh in the spring of 2014.</p>\n<p>Both performances were a little rough at times, but both were redeemed by smoking guitar jams, particularly on Night Two.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - 2014-05-23 Pittsburgh - Leavin&#039; Train\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XnXFqQmSAT0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Will we ever hear from &#8220;Leavin&#8217; Train&#8221; again?</p>\n<p>I suspect not.
