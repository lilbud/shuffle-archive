This one, as they say, is for the completists.</p>\n<p>Honestly, it&#8217;s a pretty weak song. The sentiment is admirable: it&#8217;s a call to metaphorical arms, with Bruce and Robbin exhorting their cohorts to choose love not war (or at least to\u00a0<em>choose</em> period):</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Well, come with me brothers, come with me sisters</em><br />\n<em>The time has come, we&#8217;ve got to help each other</em><br />\n<em>So pick up your guns or send out your lovers</em><br />\n<em>The choice is yours, it&#8217;s one or the other</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Now hurry up before it&#8217;s too late</em><br />\n<em>There&#8217;s even no time to waste</em><br />\n<em>The sooner it&#8217;s done, I know, the better</em><br />\n<em>So longer we wait the harder they&#8217;ll make it for us to get together</em></p>\n<p>But that message was also delivered by many other musicians of that era, typically in a more artful fashion.</p>\n<p>In fact, the lyrics are\u00a0<em>so</em> atypical of Bruce&#8217;s writing at the time that I suspect they were a co-writing exercise. (The handwritten lyrics are in Bruce&#8217;s handwriting, but we don&#8217;t have any record of where, when, or by whom the song was actually invented).</p>\n<p>There is one verse in particular that sounds like early Bruce&#8211;and differs enough from the preceding ones to lend credence to co-authorship:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>There&#8217;s no backing out cause you&#8217;re\u00a0already in</em><br />\n<em>The choice is yours, you have to make it my friend</em><br />\n<em>You&#8217;re branded as an outlaw and set on the run</em><br />\n<em>Hunted by soldiers marked as the one</em></p>\n<p>The notion of being cast as an &#8220;outlaw&#8221;&#8211;specifically the use of that term&#8211;is a theme that comes up often in Bruce&#8217;s very western-influenced writing at the time. The sudden shift of focus and tone from peace and love to the very real consequences of refusing to participate in a morally unjust war&#8211;that sounds like Bruce as well.</p>\n<p>But we&#8217;ll probably never know, and it would rank pretty close to the bottom of things I&#8217;d ever ask Bruce about if I had the chance.\u00a0\u00a0&#8220;We&#8217;ve Got to Do It Now&#8221; is likely to remain a historical curiosity.</p>\n<p><strong>We&#8217;ve Got to Do It Now</strong><br />\n<strong>Never recorded<br />\nNever released<br />\nFirst performed:</strong>\u00a0November 27, 1970 (Asbury Park, NJ)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:\u00a0</strong>November 27, 1970 (Asbury Park, NJ)</p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
