When his playlist turned up Bruce&#8217;s hit single, he found himself inspired to record his own version.</p>\n<p>J\u00f8shj\u00f8sH&#8217;s version of &#8220;Dancing in the Dark&#8221; starts out simple and traditional but takes flight at the one-minute mark and never touches the earth again. This is one of the freshest takes of this song in years. I&#8217;ve added it to my playlist, and I&#8217;m betting you might, too.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Joshjosh - Dancing In The Dark (Offical Cover)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ozpp8xewbWc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Next up: a wonderful, firelit performance by German acoustic duo Sixtyfour.</p>\n<p>Ulf Gottschalk and Harry Stingl formed Sixtyfour a few years back, naming themselves after their birth year. Although their vocals are wonderful on their own, guest vocalist Kimmy adds warmth to the duo&#8217;s lovely guitar work and Bruce&#8217;s lonely lyrics.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Dancing in the dark Bruce Springsteen  Cover by Sixtyfour feat Kimmy\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_tjNIcT0N4U?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Moving on to the U.K. now, let&#8217;s listen in on Harry Pane. Harry&#8217;s name might not be familiar to you, but with recent appearances at Glastonbury and SXSW, it might soon be.</p>\n<p>Pane&#8217;s version is stripped-down and respectfully but not overly faithful to the original. Harry adds a particularly lovely flourish in the bridge that forces the listener to acknowledge the self-pity at the heart of the song.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Dancing in the dark - Harry Pane (cover)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gXv3vCwSrEg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>If Pane&#8217;s version of &#8220;Dancing in the Dark&#8221; is mostly traditional, our next entry is at the opposite end of the spectrum.</p>\n<p>Fellow U.K. singer-songwriter Tom Seth Johnson completely transforms Bruce&#8217;s song. Only the chorus is melodically familiar, and yet it&#8217;s still instantly recognizable as &#8220;Dancing in the Dark.&#8221; It&#8217;s a terrific arrangement that&#8217;s bound to get stuck in your head. (It&#8217;s certainly stuck in mine.)</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Dancing In The Dark (Cover) - Tom Seth Johnson\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tbw586sPRxs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><strong>Bonus entry:</strong></p>\n<p>This one&#8217;s an outlier in that it&#8217;s neither modern nor indie. In fact, it&#8217;s one of the earliest-ever covers of &#8220;Dancing in the Dark,&#8221; and it proved so popular that it peaked at #21 in the U.K. in the summer of 1985.</p>\n<p>Big Daddy was formed as a cover band in the late 1970s in Los Angeles. They attracted a bit of a cult following in the U.S. thanks to their inventive cover arrangements and mash-ups and their appearances on the Doctor Demento radio show. Rhino Records signed them, and their second album <em>(Meanwhile&#8230; Back in the</em> <em>States</em>, released in 1985) featured a studio recording of &#8220;Dancing in the Dark.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Dancing in the Dark&#8221; became a moderately successful single, and they were invited to perform it on a children&#8217;s show called Razzmatazz that ran in the U.K. throughout the 1980s.</p>\n<p>Like many shows at the time, the band had to lip-sync to their recording, but there was a snag: because their single had been recorded in the U.S., U.K. law required them to air a locally produced version. The band recorded a new version of the song that morning, and the band lip-synced to it on TV later in the day.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Big Daddy with Rockin Dave Taylor, Dancing in the Dark\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LIuogpUzJYE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>You might not be able to tell, but lead singer David Starns was suffering from stomach flu at the time. He&#8217;d spent the hours in between the morning recording session and the evening taping vomiting into a wastebasket, but he managed to hold it together (with much effort) during the performance above.</p>\n<p>Starns&#8217; crooning Orbisonian vocals combined with a charming 1950s doo-wop arrangement transformed &#8220;Dancing in the Dark&#8221; (still getting quite a bit of airplay at the time) into something charmingly fresh and new. Even the hat tip to Courtney Cox&#8217;s debut at the end will warm your heart.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s it for this installment of <em>Cover-Me Round-up</em>, but given my lengthy and ever-growing list of covers, there will almost certainly be more.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>Five great, fresh takes on Bruce Springsteen&#8217;s greatest hit.</p>\n",
