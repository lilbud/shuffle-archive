They went big.</p>\n<p>On May 29th, the Boston band performed <em>Streaming Outta Fenway,\u00a0</em>an audacious live-streamed concert performed in a completely empty Fenway Park.</p>\n<p>In a Fenway first, the band performed in the infield, which only served to visually underscore the distance between the band members. In a time full of surreal visuals, this was surely one of the strangest.</p>\n<p>The event raised over $700,000 for Boston-area charities, no doubt helped by the participation of one Bruce Springsteen, who performed live with the band\u2013but not from Fenway.</p>\n<p>Bruce wisely chose not to risk the trip to Boston. Instead, he streamed his contribution to &#8220;Rose Tattoo&#8221; from his home studio. Bruce&#8217;s video was broadcast to the Fenway jumbotron, leading to the strange sight of a giant Springsteen performing with a tiny band.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"758\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fCPeuMSizTU?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></div>\n<p>That was actually the second time Bruce and the Murphys performed &#8220;Rose Tattoo&#8221; without an audience, however. The first was back in 2013.</p>\n<p>On the day of the Boston Marathon bombing, Bruce called Murphys frontman Ken Casey to offer his support. Casey accepted it. They decided to re-record their recent hit, &#8220;Rose Tattoo&#8221; (it was only a few months old at the time), this time as a collaboration with Springsteen.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"758\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kRkkStu4__M?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></div>\n<p class=\"text-justify\">As he would do years later during the pandemic, Bruce provided his contribution remotely from his home studio. By the time the band released it as the title track of a benefit EP in May, Bruce and the E Street Band were back on tour in Europe.</p>\n<p>The new version of &#8220;Rose Tattoo&#8221; peaked at #25 on the Billboard Hot Rock Songs list, and the EP raised over $300,000, which the band donated to more than sixty victims of the Boston tragedy.</p>\n<p><strong>Rose Tattoo<br />\nRecorded:</strong> 2013<br />\n<strong>Released:\u00a0</strong><em>Rose Tattoo: For Boston Charity</em> (2013)<br />\n<strong>First performed:</strong> May 29, 2020 (Boston, MA)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> May 29, 2020 (Boston, MA)</p>\n<p>\u00a9 February 28, 2026</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>It was the strangest of all team-ups, at the strangest of times.
