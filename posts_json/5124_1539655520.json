Richardson.</p>\n<p>Those few months were productive, though&#8211;Valens charted three bona fide and enduring hits in the second half of 1958, &#8220;Donna,&#8221; &#8220;La Bamba,&#8221; and his very first single, &#8220;Come On, Let&#8217;s Go.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Come On Let\u2019s Go\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\"

having never caught it, because all nine of those times we unannounced bar performances, eight of them in 1982 (all but one with Cats on a Smooth Surface at The Stone Pony, plus a Beaver Brown team-up at Big Man&#8217;s West), and the last was in the summer of 1987&#8211;one again at the The Stone Pony, this time with both the E Street Band and Cats on a Smooth Surface.</p>\n<p>A couple of these performances have been floating around youtube for a while, but none of them are very listenable.</p>\n<p>So here&#8217;s a treat: a newly uploaded, wonderfully clear recording of Bruce and Cats on a Smooth Surface performing Valens&#8217; first hit at The Stone Pony, on June 27, 1982.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen &amp; Cats on a
