It&#8217;s a remarkable performance full of fresh takes&#8211;well worth a listen (you can purchase or stream the live album). I&#8217;m sure this won&#8217;t be the only track from that concert that I&#8217;ll feature, but this is my favorite&#8211;a downright funky take on &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/06/05/roll-of-the-dice-im-goin-down/\">I&#8217;m Goin&#8217; Down</a>,&#8221; reimagined and mashed up with&#8230; well, I won&#8217;t ruin the surprise, but I think the Temptations would approve.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a fan of how Bruce reinvented &#8220;Reason to Believe&#8221; on the Magic Tour, you&#8217;ll dig this:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"758\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ADVk3_gwJf8?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></div>\n<p>Here are the clues that led up to the reveal of <em>Born in the U.S.A.</em> as 2015&#8217;s featured album.

Some are relatively faithful, some are dramatic re-imaginings, some are clever mash-ups, but all of them are great, and this is an album very much worth having.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t mind confessing that I do not like the song \u201cCover Me.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Bruce\u2019s version has always left me cold, and if I stack-ranked his entire catalog I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019d find \u201cCover Me\u201d at the bottom of it.</p>\n<p>But this version redeems it and then some. Brilliantly mashing it up with Edwin Starr\u2019s \u201cWar\u201d (which of course Bruce was known to cover on the Born in the U.S.A. Tour) breathes new life into the song\u2013so much so that it\u2019s a wonder that it never occurred to Bruce to pair them back in 1985.</p>\n<p>Take a listen and enjoy\u2013and then do yourself a favor and check out the rest of the album as well. Brilliant stuff.</p>\n<p>Oh and about those puzzles, #3 is an anagram, #1 is a song lyric, and the answers to each of them are E Street Band members.</p>\n<p>\u00a9 May 15, 2018 / July\u00a0 26, 2018 / April 22, 2019</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>A fresh and funky take on &#8220;I&#8217;m Goin&#8217; Down&#8221; by Joan Osborne and the Waybacks from MerleFest 2015.</p>\n", "protected": false}, "author": 1, "featured_media": 67806, "comment_status": "open", "ping_status": "open", "sticky": false, "template": "", "format": "standard", "meta": {"_monsterinsights_skip_tracking": false, "_monsterinsights_sitenote_active": false, "_monsterinsights_sitenote_note": "", "_monsterinsights_sitenote_category": 0, "jetpack_post_was_ever_published": false, "_jetpack_newsletter_access": "", "_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs": false, "_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id": 0, "_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content": false, "_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content": false, "footnotes": "", "jetpack_publicize_message": "", "jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled": true, "jetpack_social_post_already_shared": true, "jetpack_social_options": {"image_generator_settings": {"template": "highway", "default_image_id": 0, "font": "", "enabled": false}, "version": 2}}, "categories": [3611, 4], "tags": [1022, 412, 1019, 1021, 1020], "class_list": ["post-2231", "post", "type-post", "status-publish", "format-standard", "has-post-thumbnail", "hentry", "category-bitusa", "category-cover-me", "tag-hillside-album-hour", "tag-im-goin-down", "tag-joan-osborne", "tag-merlefest", "tag-the-waybacks"], "aioseo_notices": [], "jetpack_publicize_connections": [], "jetpack_featured_media_url": "https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/admin-ajax-15.jpg?fit=1000%2C1000&ssl=1", "jetpack_sharing_enabled": true, "jetpack_shortlink": "https://wp.me/p9w3Lk-zZ", "jetpack_likes_enabled": true, "jetpack-related-posts": [{"id": 3397, "url": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/07/26/cover-me-the-waybacks-and-joan-osborne-born-in-the-usa/", "url_meta": {"origin": 2231, "position": 0}, "title": "Cover Me, The Waybacks and Joan Osborne: Born in the U.S.A.", "author": "Ken", "date": "July 26, 2018", "format": false, "excerpt": "Another dip into the amazing \"Back in the U.S.A.\" tribute album by Joan Osborne and The Waybacks--this time a slow burn of \"Born in the U.S.A.\"", "rel": "", "context": "In &quot;Cover Me&quot;", "block_context": {"text": "Cover Me", "link": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/category/cover-me/"}, "img": {"alt_text": "", "src": "https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DMwaybacks-e1532388031468.jpg?fit=700%2C314&ssl=1&resize=350%2C200", "width": 350, "height": 200, "srcset": "https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DMwaybacks-e1532388031468.jpg?fit=700%2C314&ssl=1&resize=350%2C200 1x, https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DMwaybacks-e1532388031468.jpg?fit=700%2C314&ssl=1&resize=525%2C300 1.5x, https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DMwaybacks-e1532388031468.jpg?fit=700%2C314&ssl=1&resize=700%2C400 2x"}, "classes": []}, {"id": 8275, "url": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/1984/01/24/cover-me-joan-osborne-and-the-waybacks-cover-me/", "url_meta": {"origin": 2231, "position": 1}, "title": "Joan Osborne and The Waybacks: Cover Me", "author": "Ken", "date": "January 24, 1984", "format": false, "excerpt": "Let's take another visit to MerleFest 2015 and the absolutely brilliant tribute performance by Joan Osborne and The Waybacks.
