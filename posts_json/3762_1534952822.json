He didn&#8217;t say much by way of introduction, and what he did say was cryptic:</p>\n<p>&#8220;This for Ken. Thanks for the nice card.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Ken&#8221; is Kenny Chesney, and the card in question was a note that Chesney included when he sent Bruce his recording of &#8220;One Step Up&#8221; from his 2002 album,\u00a0<em>No Shoes, No Shirt, No Problems.</em></p>\n<p>Chesney has been pretty open about his reverence for Bruce&#8217;s music, and his fondness for &#8220;One Step Up&#8221; dates back to his bar gig days. He&#8217;d always intended to record it but, &#8220;I knew I needed to wait until I&#8217;d lived enough to really sing the song. I felt like I owed it what it was: don&#8217;t just sing it &#8217;cause it&#8217;s Bruce; wait &#8217;til I really understand.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"One Step Up\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SzFk7R2thiA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Maybe he understood it when he recorded it in the studio, but there&#8217;s no doubt he&#8217;d lived it by the time he performed it live at The Stone Pony fifteen years later.
