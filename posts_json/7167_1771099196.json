It&#8217;s one of Bruce&#8217;s best songs, and while it may not come immediately to mind when mentally browsing Bruce&#8217;s catalog, when you hear it, it&#8217;s bound to stick with you for days afterward.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The Big Muddy&#8221; sticks out like a sore thumb on\u00a0<em>Lucky Town</em>, the 1992 album that introduced it to us. On an album full of bright, shiny optimism, how the heck did a song like this end up smack in the middle of it? Only &#8220;Souls of the Departed&#8221; keeps it from being the sole rebel on the album, but whereas &#8220;Souls of the Departed&#8221; is an angry song, &#8220;The Big Muddy&#8221; is just&#8230; unsettling.</p>\n<p>Everything about it sounds ominous, from Bruce&#8217;s lyrics to his idle guitar and meandering riff. (Bruce plays almost solo, accompanied only by Roy on keyboards and Gary Mallaber on drums.) This is the song of a man uncertain about the way forward.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s take a listen.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"758\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kdZKratq6mw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></div>\n<p>That&#8217;s one foreboding song, isn&#8217;t it?</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also one of Bruce&#8217;s most referential songs, so before we dive into the lyrics, let&#8217;s start by acknowledging the song&#8217;s title&#8211;an intentional reference to Pete Seeger&#8217;s famous anti-war song, &#8220;Waist Deep in the Big Muddy.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"758\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uXnJVkEX8O4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></div>\n<p>Bruce&#8217;s song is focused on more intimate conflicts than Pete&#8217;s song, but they share a central conceit: that the waters of moral corruption run deep, and if you think you can wade in one side and out the other, you&#8217;re very likely deceiving yourself&#8211;perhaps irredeemably so.</p>\n<p>Our muddiest imbroglios often start in relative innocence, as Bruce (via Billy) relates below:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Billy had a mistress down on A and 12th</em><br />\n<em>She was that little something that he did for himself</em><br />\n<em>His own little secret didn&#8217;t hurt nobody</em><br />\n<em>Come the afternoon he&#8217;d take her wading</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Waist deep in the big muddy</em><br />\n<em>Waist deep in the big muddy</em><br />\n<em>You start out standing but end up crawling, sonny</em></p>\n<p>Notice how Billy rationalizes his infidelity: his mistress is just a &#8220;little something that he did for himself.&#8221; He works hard, and presumably takes good care of his family. Doesn&#8217;t he deserve a little special treatment? Especially if no one else knows, who does it hurt?</p>\n<p>We must take a moment to acknowledge the brilliance in Bruce&#8217;s songwriting in those last lines: when Billy takes his mistress wading waist deep in the big muddy, does he mean it literally? (Perhaps a daily afternoon swim?) Euphemistically? (A nooner is a more likely scenario.) Or metaphorically? (Sinking deeper into darker and darker moral territory.)</p>\n<p>One verse in, and we&#8217;ve got a\u00a0<em>triple</em> entendre&#8211;and in a song that&#8217;s all about moral ambiguity, what could be more perfect than that?</p>\n<p>In the second verse, the scene shifts&#8211;similar, in a way, to &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/02/27/roll-of-the-dice-reason-to-believe/\">Reason to Believe,</a>&#8221; in which Bruce uses vignettes rather than an overarching narrative to illustrate a point.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Got in some trouble and needed a hand from a friend of mine</em><br />\n<em>This old friend had a figure in mind</em><br />\n<em>It was nothing illegal, just a little bit funny</em><br />\n<em>He said &#8220;C&#8217;mon don&#8217;t tell me that the rich don&#8217;t know, sonny</em><br />\n<em>Sooner or later it all comes down to money&#8221;</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>And you&#8217;re waist deep in the big muddy</em><br />\n<em>Waist deep in the big muddy</em><br />\n<em>You start on higher ground but end up crawling, sonny</em></p>\n<p>What kind of trouble did Bruce (now singing in the first person) find himself in? We never learn, but it was dire enough to require some specialized help from a &#8220;friend&#8221; who knew he had the singer over a barrel. &#8220;Sooner or later it all comes down to money,&#8221; he says, and if you&#8217;ve got it, you can buy your way out of most kinds of trouble. And when you know you can do that, what does that do to your moral rudder?</p>\n<p>The crux of the song comes in the bridge:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Well I had a friend, said &#8220;You watch what you do</em><br />\n<em>Poison snake bites you and you&#8217;re poison too&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>Most accounts of this song cite this adage as a direct quote from Pete Dexter&#8217;s novel\u00a0<em>Paris Trout,\u00a0</em>and the notion does indeed come from that story. But the original line isn&#8217;t about a snake&#8211;it&#8217;s about a fox, cleverer and therefore far more dangerous than a snake:</p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">She passed the windows wide, averting her eyes, and when she was safely by and looked in front of herself again, she saw the fox. He was dull red and tired and seemed in some way to recognize her.</span><br />\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">\u00a0</span><br />\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">She stopped cold in her tracks, the fox picked up his head. She took a slow step backwards, and he followed her, keeping the same distance. Then he moved again, closer, and seemed to sway. She heard her own breathing as she backed away.</span><br />\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">\u00a0</span><br />\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The movement only seemed to draw him; something drew him. \u201cPlease, Mr. Fox,\u201d she said, \u201cdon\u2019t poison me. I be out of your way, as quick as you seen me, I be gone.\u201d</span><br />\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">\u00a0</span><br />\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">She knew foxes had turned poisonous from her brothers. Worse than a snake. She stopped again, and he stopped with her. Her brothers said when the poison fox bit you, you were poison too.</span><br />\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">\u00a0</span><br />\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The fox cocked his head, and she began to run. She didn\u2019t know where. Her legs were strong; but before she had gone ten steps, they seemed to tangle in each other, and she was surprised, looking down just before she fell, to see the fox between them. Then she closed her eyes and hit the ground.</span><br />\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">\u00a0</span><br />\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">She never felt the bites. The fox growled\u2014the sound was higher-pitched than a dog, and busier\u2014and then she kicked out with her heels and felt his coat and the bones beneath it. He cried out, and when she kicked again nothing was there.</span><br />\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">\u00a0</span><br />\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">She opened her eyes, and as fast as he had come he was gone.</span><br />\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">\u00a0</span><br />\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">She stood up slowly, collecting her breath, and dusted herself off. She was thorough about it, she didn\u2019t like to be dirty, and it was only when her hand touched the inside of her calf and felt blood that she knew that he had opened her up.</span><br />\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">\u00a0</span><br />\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">She saw the bites then, two small openings on the same leg, closer to her ankle than her knee. The blood wasn\u2019t much and had already dried everywhere except near the tears in the skin. She sat back down on the ground and began to cry. The clay was scorched, but she didn\u2019t feel that either.</span><br />\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">\u00a0</span><br />\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">She cried because she was poisoned.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p>Having the full context of that passage helps us appreciate Bruce&#8217;s intent in quoting it: the danger isn&#8217;t just that you might get bitten and poisoned&#8211;it&#8217;s that you might not even feel the bite.</p>\n<p>(And yeah, it probably wouldn&#8217;t have been a cleaner reference if Bruce had used the fox rather than the snake, but to a listener unfamiliar with the novel the notion of a &#8220;poison fox&#8221; would sound strange and jarring enough to break the song&#8217;s power and take us out of it. So we&#8217;ll cut him a break. Besides, Bruce got two great songs out of it: he used the same line in &#8220;Gave it a Name.&#8221;)</p>\n<p>Just in case the song&#8217;s message is too subtle, Bruce makes it explicit in the final verse:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Well how beautiful the river flows and the birds they sing</em><br />\n<em>But you and I we&#8217;re messier things</em><br />\n<em>There ain&#8217;t no one leaving this world buddy</em><br />\n<em>Without their shirttail dirty or hands a little bloody</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Waist deep in the big muddy</em><br />\n<em>Waist deep in the big muddy</em><br />\n<em>You start on higher ground but end up somehow crawling, sonny</em></p>\n<p>In other words, let&#8217;s not judge Billy or the singer, because we&#8217;re all a little dirty and bloody. We wade through life in a series of compromises, moral and otherwise, and we do our best to keep our head above water.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, though, we end up crawling, hoping to find solid ground again so we can stand.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Bruce played &#8220;The Big Muddy&#8221; regularly throughout World Tour 1992, but it hasn&#8217;t been seen since. It&#8217;s a tough song to translate to a live setting: it demands attention. It&#8217;s not a quiet song, but it&#8217;s an atmospheric one, and the sonics are as important to the song&#8217;s power as the lyrics. Perhaps that&#8217;s why Bruce hasn&#8217;t attempted it in concert in over a quarter century.</p>\n<p>We do have one particularly stellar live performance to enjoy, however: Bruce performed &#8220;The Big Muddy&#8221; with his 1992 touring band on his\u00a0<em>MTV Unplugged</em> special (that turned out to be anything but unplugged). While the song wasn&#8217;t released on the audio CD, it was restored to the performance when the concert was released officially on VHS.</p>\n<p>Enjoy the official video (yes, there is one) for &#8220;The Big Muddy.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\"
