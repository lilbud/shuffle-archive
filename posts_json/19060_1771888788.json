(She draws that &#8220;ssssssatin valentine&#8221; out to the perfect nanosecond.) Her backing vocalists are terrific talents, too, and very familiar ones to E Street Nation&#8211;that&#8217;s Soozie Tyrell and Lisa Lowell you hear.</p>\n<p>But what takes the album into flight is her backing group of musicians, the self-dubbed The Whack Brothers Rhythm Section. Accomplished musicians all, there&#8217;s a comfort and ease between them that makes the entire album a joy to listen to, but perhaps no more than\u00a0 on &#8220;Rainy Day Man.&#8221;</p>\n<p>You know most of the Whack Brothers: Besides Clifford Carter on keyboards and Willie Weeks on bass (both of whom played on Patti&#8217;s previous album as well), there&#8217;s Steve Jordan on percussion (who previously appeared all over <em>Devils &amp; Dust</em> and later on &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/06/10/roll-of-the-dice-easy-money/\">Easy Money</a>&#8220;), and the very familiar Nils Lofgren on pedal steel and dobro.</p>\n<p>Oh, and there&#8217;s one more Whack: Patti&#8217;s husband, Mr. Rainy Day Man himself, who makes his electric guitar entrance just before Patti calls his name.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not aware of a live performance of &#8220;Rainy Day Man,&#8221; sadly, and that&#8217;s too bad.
