I had left a job in the music industry in April and needed to find work.</p>\n<p>My friend with whom I had worked previously reached out to me. He had scored a job working for Bruce and the band, and they were rehearsing at Ft. Monmouth for the Rising Tour. They needed a production assistant, and I knew exactly what that meant, having done it at the Garden State Arts Center in the early nineties.</p>\n<p>My first day was July 18th. I arrived there in the late morning (rock and roll hours I guess!), an excited life-long fan eager to see behind the scenes, and I met up with Kevin Buell.</p>\n<p>My job was to run errands for Bruce and the band. Bruce&#8217;s cousin had been doing this for them, but he had personal obligations for the three days that I was to fill in for him. Happy to do so!</p>\n<p>Each day, I was sent out to pick up food, supplies, instruments, etc. My down time? Sitting on the side of the stage watching the band go through the songs&#8211;an uber fan&#8217;s dream come true!</p>\n<p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-attachment-id=\"11236\" data-permalink=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/2002-07-12/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/2002-07-12.jpg?fit=426%2C287&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"426,287\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"2002-07-12\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/2002-07-12.jpg?fit=300%2C202&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/2002-07-12.jpg?fit=426%2C287&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-11236\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/2002-07-12-300x202.jpg?resize=758%2C510\" alt=\"\" width=\"758\" height=\"510\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/2002-07-12.jpg?resize=300%2C202&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/2002-07-12.jpg?w=426&amp;ssl=1 426w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 758px) 100vw, 758px\" /></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Everyone</span> </em>was so genuine and nice.\u00a0 Bruce really surrounds himself with people like himself.

He ran the show, and he is a tough guy on the crew.\u00a0 He was firm but nice at the same time.</p>\n<p>The guitars&#8230;whoa! The row of guitars stretched 30 feet, with an amazing variety.</p>\n<p>It was a very relaxed atmosphere during those three days. I got a &#8220;hey&#8221; from Bruce as he walked past me, sipping a smoothie.</p>\n<p>On July 19th, I had to drive Bruce&#8217;s guitar, harmonica and capo out to Terry McGovern so Terry could bring it to Bruce to his house in Colts Neck for his interview with Ted Koppel.

They ran through the whole set and timed it. I was on stage right and watched the entire performance.</p>\n<p>After that third day, the band was headed to Convention Hall to set up for the Today show appearance on July 30th.</p>\n<p>I went back to my life of searching for a job. In those days, I had <em>The Today Show</em> on in my office while job hunting, and the Today Show Bus to Asbury Park contest was airing. It was a trivia contest: answer the trivia questions and all of the people with the correct answers would be eligible for one spot out of 35 on the bus to Asbury. I entered the contest just on a whim, not thinking anything of it.</p>\n<p>A day later, I got a call from someone at NBC&#8230; I won a spot! Awesome! But&#8230; I had to take a bus from my home in Lincroft (a 15 minute drive from Asbury Park) to Rockefeller Plaza, hop on their bus and drive back down to Asbury.</p>\n<p>I pleaded with the girl, can&#8217;t I just meet the bus in Asbury? No go. I have to travel to NYC and get on that bus.</p>\n<p>So, that&#8217;s what I did: I took a 3am bus and landed in Rockefeller Plaza around 4:30am, where I hopped on the bus with the other 34 winners and Billy Bush. Bruce music playing, Billy Bush interviewing people.</p>\n<p>We got to the venue and were the first ones let in. We had our own section right up front, roped off from the rest of the crowd. As the crew prepared the stage for the show, they recognized my face and were perplexed on what I was doing there. I explained to some of them that I won the contest and here I was! Funny stuff&#8230;</p>\n<p>The rest we all know&#8230; Bruce came out early, did an acoustic set then the band later on.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Today Show Interview and &quot;The Rising&quot; - 7/30/02\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ar-qvX1F0t4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>My first of two stints with Bruce and The E Street Band.</p>\n<div class=\"su-box su-box-style-default\" id=\"\" style=\"border-color:#000000;border-radius:3px;\"><div class=\"su-box-title\" style=\"background-color:#333333;color:#FFFFFF;border-top-left-radius:1px;border-top-right-radius:1px\">What's your story?</div><div class=\"su-box-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim\" style=\"border-bottom-left-radius:1px;border-bottom-right-radius:1px\">\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><em>Want to share your story on E Street Shuffle? </em></span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><em><a href=\"mailto:ken@estreetshuffle.com\">Drop me a line</a></em></span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><em> if you&#8217;d like to be our next guest blogger!</em></span></p>\n</div></div>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>Guest-blogger Mark Cunningham takes us behind the scenes at Bruce\u2019s Rising Tour rehearsals.</p>\n", "protected": false}, "author": 1, "featured_media": 11643, "comment_status": "open", "ping_status": "open", "sticky": false, "template": "", "format": "standard", "meta": {"_monsterinsights_skip_tracking": false, "_monsterinsights_sitenote_active": false, "_monsterinsights_sitenote_note": "", "_monsterinsights_sitenote_category": 0, "jetpack_post_was_ever_published": false, "_jetpack_newsletter_access": "", "_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs": false, "_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id": 0, "_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content": false, "_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content": false, "footnotes": "", "jetpack_publicize_message": "", "jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled": true, "jetpack_social_post_already_shared": true, "jetpack_social_options": {"image_generator_settings": {"template": "highway", "default_image_id": 0, "font": "", "enabled": false}, "version": 2}}, "categories": [152], "tags": [2411, 38, 2410], "class_list": ["post-11637", "post", "type-post", "status-publish", "format-standard", "has-post-thumbnail", "hentry", "category-where-the-band-was", "tag-mark-cunningham", "tag-the-rising", "tag-the-today-show"], "aioseo_notices": [], "jetpack_publicize_connections": [], "jetpack_featured_media_url": "https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Fort_Monmouth_Expo_Theater.jpg?fit=600%2C400&ssl=1", "jetpack_sharing_enabled": true, "jetpack_shortlink": "https://wp.me/p9w3Lk-31H", "jetpack_likes_enabled": true, "jetpack-related-posts": [{"id": 16358, "url": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/03/04/cover-me-my-oklahoma-home/", "url_meta": {"origin": 11637, "position": 0}, "title": "Cover Me: My Oklahoma Home", "author": "Ken", "date": "March 4, 2020", "format": false, "excerpt": "In 1997, Bruce plucked Sis Cunningham's bitingly funny dust bowl chronicle from obscurity when he recorded it in his very first Seeger Session.
