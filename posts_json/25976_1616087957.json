Hey what? Get laid, get fucked!&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>Or something like that. That&#8217;s what we shouted in Philadelphia, but there are several regional variations of the first part of the chant across the U.S. and Canada. The second part is always the same, though.</p>\n<p>The thing is: no one knows exactly how it started. Like, <em>no one</em>. Not even Billy Idol, who&#8217;s been asked about it at length:</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Billy Idol explains the origins of the special audience lyrics for &quot;Mony Mony&quot; by alancross\" width=\"758\" height=\"400\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&#038;url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F172934348&#038;show_artwork=true&#038;maxwidth=758&#038;maxheight=1000&#038;dnt=1\"></iframe></p>\n<p>All we know is that it started in 1987, and it&#8217;s continued ever since. By the time Billy Idol reissued &#8220;Mony Mony&#8221; in 2018 as a remix, he pretty much had no choice but to include the unofficial lyrics.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Mony Mony (Idol/Stevens Remix)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cyt-BY-vqms?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>What does this have to do with Bruce? Nothing, really, I&#8217;m just fascinated by it. But I swear: if you listen intently during the half-dozen times he covered &#8220;Mony Mony&#8221; during the Working on a Dream Tour in 2009, you can definitely hear the crowd chanting.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Mony Mony - Bruce Springsteen (23-05-2009 Izod Center,East Rutherford,New Jersey)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eH32lJGfnDc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>I think so, at least. My brain has mentally filled in those lines for so long, I can&#8217;t even tell anymore if I really hear them or not.</p>\n<p>I had to laugh, though, when Bruce released an official video of the very first time he ever covered it at one of his concerts, because the &#8220;weird part&#8221; he skips to is\u00a0<em>not at all\u00a0</em> what I would consider the weird part.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Mony Mony - Live from Chicago - Working On A Dream Tour - 2009\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yVdKRebTKx4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>I wasn&#8217;t there that night, but I&#8217;m pretty sure I can guess why Bruce edited out all the verses.</p>\n<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> Bruce actually covered &#8220;Mony Mony&#8221; once prior to the Working on a Dream Tour, but you definitely can\u00a0<em>not</em> hear the &#8220;get laid&#8221; chant during it. That&#8217;s because it was 1982, five years before the meme originated. The performance is notable anyway, though, because it was the very first song Bruce and Joe Grushecky ever performed together, at Big Man&#8217;s West way back in Joe&#8217;s Iron City Houserockers days.
