Do\u00a0<em>you</em> know the words to 1200+ songs by heart?</p>\n<p>(If you answered yes, check back with me when you&#8217;re in your mid-forties.)</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s surprisingly hard to remember all the words to a song, even one you sing frequently. But when you cover a song you&#8217;ve hardly ever performed before, even if it&#8217;s one you&#8217;ve known your whole life and <em>think</em> you know by heart&#8230; well, you might find yourself out on a tightrope without a net.</p>\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t help when the song doesn&#8217;t exactly follow a narrative structure. Take Little Richard&#8217;s &#8220;Bama Lama Bama Loo,&#8221; for example. A late career entry, it only notched as high as #82 on the Billboard Top 100 in the summer of 1964.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Little Richard &quot;Bama Lama Bama Loo&quot;\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ojgQ5lfLmUw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>There aren&#8217;t a whole lot of lyrics in &#8220;Bama Lama Bama Loo,&#8221; but when Bruce took lead vocals with Joe Grushecky and The Houserockers on an impromptu cover of it in the summer of &#8217;94, Bruce couldn&#8217;t remember\u00a0<em>any of them</em>.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bama Lama Lama Loo - Bruce Springteen (20-08-1994 Marz American Style, Long Branc, New Jersey)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IOqobm0202Q?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>We can tell pretty quickly that Bruce is flying by the seat of his pants: he starts with the chorus and doesn&#8217;t budge from it for almost a full minute. And he doesn&#8217;t even get\u00a0<em>that\u00a0</em>right&#8211;he sings it as &#8220;bama lama <em>lama</em> loo.&#8221;</p>\n<p>And when he finally attempts a verse, he confuses &#8220;Bama Lama Bama Loo&#8221; with &#8220;Tutti Frutti,&#8221; mashing up verses from the latter with the chorus from the former, stitching them as best he can. (To be fair, the two songs are <em>very</em> similar&#8211;Little Richard was almost certainly trying to recreate his earlier success.)</p>\n<p>For a less secure artist, it could have been a train wreck moment, but Bruce can improvise with the best of them. And with Joe at his side and the well-oiled Houserockers behind him, if you weren&#8217;t paying attention you&#8217;d never know anything was amiss.</p>\n<p>I bet he wished he had a teleprompter that night, though.</p>\n<p><strong>Bama Lama Bama Loo<br />\nFirst performed:</strong> September 18, 1982 (Red Bank, NJ)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> August 20, 1994 (Long Branch, NJ)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>In the summer of &#8217;94, Bruce improvised his way through a cover of Little Richard&#8217;s &#8220;Bama Lama Bama Loo&#8221; with Joe Grushecky and The Houserockers.
