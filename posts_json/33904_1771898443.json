When they decided to record &#8220;Double Shot&#8221; in the studio, however, they quickly grew frustrated at their inability to capture the energy of their live performances.</p>\n<p>The Medallions solved their problem by turning their studio session into a live performance. &#8220;We actually pulled in people off the street and had a big crowd in the studio to make background noise,&#8221; lead singer John McElrath told <em>Rebeat Magazine,\u00a0</em>&#8220;and that party atmosphere gave us the sound we were looking for.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"758\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/57s89xrC93o?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></div>\n<p>The Medallions&#8217; version of &#8220;Double Shot&#8221; became an immediate local hit, and it soon became clear that it was going to have legs beyond the area as well. The song got picked up by Smash Records, and The Medallions changed their name to The Swingin&#8217; Medallions for their national release.</p>\n<p>They had to make a few surgical changes, though&#8211;a few of the lyrics were deemed a bit too risqu\u00e9 to release as is.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"758\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vg1yZIfe9vQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></div>\n<p>The edited version made it all the way to #17 on the Billboard Hot 100, but it&#8217;s the original version that endures as the fondly remembered classic, covered live by countless artists, including Bruce Springsteen and The E Street Band.</p>\n<p>Bruce first covered &#8220;Double Shot&#8221; at a late night surprise appearance with Beaver Brown after a Darkness show in New Haven, CT. No recording is known to exist of that live debut, but a couple weeks later, Bruce covered it in concert proper in South Bend, Indiana.
