The Beatles hadn&#8217;t intended for &#8220;The End&#8221; to close out the album (let alone their career) at the time they recorded it, and by all accounts Paul was simply looking for a satisfying way to cap off the medley. He took his inspiration from The Bard, who liked to close his plays with a standalone couplet.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The End&#8221; comes at, well, the end of a sixteen-minute medley of short or incomplete Lennon-McCartney songs that never made it to vinyl in final form.</p>\n<p>Bookended by brief lyrical snippets, the track is essentially an instrumental jam, with Paul, John, and George trading off three rounds of two-bar guitar solos and featuring Ringo&#8217;s only drum solo on a Beatles track.</p>\n<p>The guitar jam is the track&#8217;s highlight. Even without reading interviews confirming it, we can hear the infectious abandon and friendly competition between the three guitar-wielding Beatles.</p>\n<p>It puts aspiring artists on notice: if you&#8217;re going to perform &#8220;The End&#8221; live in concert, you better have three hot-shot guitarists on hand to do it justice.</p>\n<p>Even if you&#8217;re Paul McCartney.</p>\n<p>Luckily for Sir Paul, when he was asked to close out the 54th Annual Grammy Awards in 2012 with &#8220;The End,&#8221; he had an array of stellar guitar talent on hand to choose from.</p>\n<p>In the end, he had\u00a0<em>six</em> guitar heroes on stage: besides himself and his two outstanding touring guitarists Rusty Anderson and Brian Ray, McCartney invited Dave Grohl, Joe Walsh, and Bruce Springsteen to join the epic televised jam.</p>\n<p>Bruce easily held his own against that formidable line-up, and in the clip below we can clearly see him having the time of his life.</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"VideoPress Video Player\" aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='426' src='https://videopress.com/embed/0ABz94N6?at=216&amp;hd=0&amp;cover=1' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script src='https://v0.wordpress.com/js/next/videopress-iframe.js?m=1770107250'></script></p>\n<p>For a kid who grew up idolizing The Beatles, the chance to support McCartney on stage like that even once would be a bucket list dream.</p>\n<p>A decade later, however, Springsteen had the chance to do it again. Twice.</p>\n<p>Bruce had already been on stage for a couple of songs (including his own &#8220;Glory Days&#8221;) earlier in the set at McCartney&#8217;s 80th birthday show at MetLife Stadium in 2022. He came back out for the final encore, joining McCartney, Anderson and Ray for the show-closing &#8220;The End.&#8221;</p>\n<p>With only four guitarists at the fore for an extra-long jam, Bruce had even more at-bats than he did at The Grammys, and the hometown crowd went wild for it.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"758\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/whSVXfetz4g?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></div>\n<p>Just nine days later, Bruce reprised his guest appearance at McCartney&#8217;s headlining gig across the pond at Glastonbury.</p>\n<p>That appearance was actually a promise kept: McCartney had asked Bruce to join him for the gig two years earlier&#8230; in 2020.</p>\n<p>Springsteen agreed, but a global pandemic forced the festival to punt the gig two years down the road. Bruce remembered his promise, however, and showed up for his songwriting idol. This time, Dave Grohl was there too, lending some extra guitar power to the final number.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display:
