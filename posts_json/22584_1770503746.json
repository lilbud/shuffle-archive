Tour. We went out there, and Bruce walked out that night and sang &#8216;Born in the U.S.A.&#8217; right out of the box. Three hours and fifteen minutes later, I walked out into the Tennessee night, and I knew exactly what to do. I went home and wrote &#8216;Guitar Town.'&#8221; &#8212; <em>Steve Earle, December 4, 2016</em></span></p></blockquote>\n<p>It was the evening of December 9, 1984, at an otherwise unremarkable show on the Born in the U.S.A. Tour.</p>\n<p>But even a &#8220;standard&#8221; Springsteen show has the power to inspire great art and great artists, and Steve Earle credits that show at Middle Tennessee State University with opening his eyes to the power of rock and roll and sending him down a lifelong path from that moment on. (In truth, though, Earle had already been performing for a decade and recording for a couple of years as a country artist.)</p>\n<p>Still, Earle did write &#8220;Guitar Town&#8221; shortly thereafter as the title song and lead single for his 1986 debut album, and it became a country rock hit, notching the number seven spot on the Billboard Country chart and earning Earle Grammy nominations in both the &#8220;Best Country Song&#8221; and &#8220;Best Male Country Vocalist&#8221; categories.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"758\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/AINUPFbFpqg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></div>\n<p>Twelve years after its release, Earle finally got a chance to perform &#8220;Guitar Town&#8221; with the man who inspired it. When Earle played at Tradewinds on the Jersey Shore, local boy Bruce Springsteen dropped by to catch the show.</p>\n<p>Earle invited Bruce to join his band on stage for the encore set, and Bruce ended up staying through six songs, all on guitar and occasional backing vocals. Of course, one of those songs had to be &#8220;Guitar Town,&#8221; and you can hear him here on guitar.</p>\n<div id=\"v-YDKFaaxq-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='568' src='https://videopress.com/embed/YDKFaaxq?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>That was the only time Bruce has ever performed &#8220;Guitar Town.&#8221; For more one-time-only Earle/Springsteen performances, check out the other songs they played that night <a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/?s=steve+earle\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Guitar Town<br />\n</strong><strong>First performed:\u00a0</strong>February 6, 1998 (Sea Bright, NJ)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:\u00a0</strong>February 6, 1998 (Sea Bright, NJ)</p>\n<p>\u00a9 November 28, 2020</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>One time only: In 1998, Bruce joined Steve Earle on the song he inspired fourteen years earlier.</p>\n", "protected": false}, "author": 1, "featured_media": 23084, "comment_status": "open", "ping_status": "open", "sticky": false, "template": "", "format": "standard", "meta": {"_monsterinsights_skip_tracking": false, "_monsterinsights_sitenote_active": false, "_monsterinsights_sitenote_note": "", "_monsterinsights_sitenote_category": 0, "jetpack_post_was_ever_published": false, "_jetpack_newsletter_access": "", "_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs": false, "_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id": 0, "_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content": false, "_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content": false, "footnotes": "", "jetpack_publicize_message": "", "jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled": true, "jetpack_social_post_already_shared": true, "jetpack_social_options": {"image_generator_settings": {"template": "highway", "default_image_id": 0, "font": "", "enabled": false}, "version": 2}}, "categories": [4, 3609, 5], "tags": [2973, 221], "class_list": ["post-22584", "post", "type-post", "status-publish", "format-standard", "has-post-thumbnail", "hentry", "category-cover-me", "category-little-help", "category-meeting-across-the-river", "tag-guitar-town", "tag-steve-earle"], "aioseo_notices": [], "jetpack_publicize_connections": [], "jetpack_featured_media_url": "https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/guitartown.jpg?fit=1200%2C1200&ssl=1", "jetpack_sharing_enabled": true, "jetpack_shortlink": "https://wp.me/p9w3Lk-5Sg", "jetpack_likes_enabled": true, "jetpack-related-posts": [{"id": 6260, "url": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/01/04/matr-steve-earle-and-bruce-springsteen-johnny-come-lately/", "url_meta": {"origin": 22584, "position": 0}, "title": "MatR: Steve Earle and Bruce Springsteen, Johnny Come Lately", "author": "Ken", "date": "January 4, 2019", "format": false, "excerpt": "One time only: Bruce joins Steve Earle and the Dukes on \"Johnny Come Lately,\" Earle's sibling song to \"Born in the U.S.A.\"", "rel": "", "context": "In &quot;Cover Me&quot;", "block_context": {"text": "Cover Me", "link": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/category/cover-me/"}, "img": {"alt_text": "", "src": "https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/steve-earle-johnny-come-lately-1988-5.jpg?fit=700%2C703&ssl=1&resize=350%2C200", "width": 350, "height": 200, "srcset": "https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/steve-earle-johnny-come-lately-1988-5.jpg?fit=700%2C703&ssl=1&resize=350%2C200 1x, https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/steve-earle-johnny-come-lately-1988-5.jpg?fit=700%2C703&ssl=1&resize=525%2C300 1.5x, https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/steve-earle-johnny-come-lately-1988-5.jpg?fit=700%2C703&ssl=1&resize=700%2C400 2x"}, "classes": []}, {"id": 62973, "url": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2025/12/09/kingdom-of-days-december-9-2/", "url_meta": {"origin": 22584, "position": 1}, "title": "Kingdom of Days: December 9", "author": "Ken", "date": "December 9, 2025", "format": false, "excerpt": "On this date: Bruce surprises with a call-in to E Street Radio and a guest appearance with Gaslight Anthem, plus an emotional show the day after John Lennon's death.
