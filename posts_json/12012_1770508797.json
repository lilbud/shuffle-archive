It remains one of my favorite and most-played albums to this day. I didn&#8217;t know at the time that I&#8217;d caught Malin at a key moment in his evolution from punk band frontman to singer-songwriter, but I could certainly sense that in his music. That album felt at once fresh and nostalgic, and I already want to go listen to it again as soon as I finish writing.</p>\n<p>By the time Jesse released his third album,\u00a0<em>Glitter in the Gutter,\u00a0</em>in 2007, I was a fan for life. Even so, I was completely unprepared for the power of the fourth track on that CD, &#8220;Broken Radio.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"758\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iPmh_BHJQ_g?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></div>\n<p>Jesse wrote &#8220;Broken Radio&#8221; for his mother, who died when he was only eighteen. Jesse has described her as an aspiring singer who never made it big. A single parent, she became a waitress but never forgot her dream. And if a song ever came on the radio, she&#8217;d stop what she was doing and sing.</p>\n<p>If that story sounds at all familiar to Springsteen fans, it&#8217;s probably because Bruce has told a similar story about his own mom&#8211;whenever music was playing, she&#8217;d stop what she was doing and dance. Years into her battle with Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, it remained the one always reliable essence of her core self.</p>\n<p>So when Jesse sent Bruce the lyrics for &#8220;Broken Radio,&#8221; in which Jesse describes how he associates his mother so strongly with the radio that he can&#8217;t help but summon her presence whenever it plays, I have to believe Bruce was immediately on-board for the duet&#8211;even if he hadn&#8217;t already once promised Jesse that he was happy to help anytime Jesse needed him.</p>\n<p>In August 2006, Jesse and his producer trekked out to Bruce&#8217;s house to record Bruce&#8217;s vocals. In an interview nine years later, Jesse tells of his producer&#8217;s dissatisfaction with Bruce&#8217;s initial takes and insistence that Bruce give it another go&#8230; and another, and another, much to Jesse&#8217;s mortified dismay: &#8220;I\u2019m dying, I\u2019m so embarrassed&#8230; there were a couple of moments there where I thought \u2018are we gonna get thrown out of his house?\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>But in the end, the take they ran with was perfect. Bruce&#8217;s vocals are both gruff and tender, sounding for all the world like he might be Jesse&#8217;s father&#8211;which is wholly appropriate since Bruce appears to be singing lines written from that very perspective. The result is an achingly lovely ballad and a family&#8217;s tribute to a lost loved one, with intensely private lyrical references like &#8220;stomachache Sundays&#8221; that somehow manage to sound universal.</p>\n<p>When Jesse starts the first chorus with &#8220;your baby loves you more than you know,&#8221; I&#8217;m in tears. When Bruce leaves that final &#8220;The angels love you more&#8230;&#8221; hanging, I&#8217;m sobbing.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Broken Radio&#8221; is a bravely beautiful song.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Bruce and Jesse performed &#8220;Broken Radio&#8221; live together twice&#8211;almost exactly a year apart.</p>\n<p>Their debut performance was at the Light of Day benefit in 2010. Despite the welcome addition of a viola to warm up the sound, though, Jesse and Bruce couldn&#8217;t quite match the tenderness of their studio performance. (Bruce also missed his final cue, leaving Jesse hanging, although you&#8217;d only know it if you were intimately familiar with the original recording.)</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"758\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WQUvW0MC_Bo?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></div>\n<p>But 364 days later, they had another chance at it at Light of Day 2011, and this time they nailed it:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"758\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DJ9UWFwtFDU?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></div>\n<p>Bruce seemed to be really feeling the lyrics that night, in a way he hadn&#8217;t just a year before. During his Broadway show in 2018, Bruce would regularly refer to his mother&#8217;s seven-year battle with Alzheimer&#8217;s disease. Backing out the math, I can&#8217;t help but wonder if on this night in 2011, &#8220;Broken Radio&#8221; was beginning to take on an unexpectedly new resonance.</p>\n<p>Perhaps that&#8217;s reading too much into it. Regardless, both the studio and 2011 live performance of &#8220;Broken Radio&#8221; remain among my all-time favorite Springsteen collaborations.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><span
