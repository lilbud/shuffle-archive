Tom whispered something in Bruce&#8217;s ear, and Bruce nodded enthusiastically in agreement. Bruce went to each of the band members and mouthed &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/10/10/roll-of-the-dice-seeds/\">Seeds</a>!&#8221; &#8212; calling an audible before the show even started.</p>\n<p>When the band started playing and the audience realized what song it was, the crowd erupted&#8211;and you can see Bruce&#8217;s and Tom&#8217;s satisfied reactions and congratulations below.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Seeds (Houston 05.06.14) HD\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/U4zKgUzV5UI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>From &#8220;Seeds&#8221; into &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/08/25/cover-me-high-hopes/\">High Hopes</a>&#8221; into &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/05/20/roll-of-the-dice-badlands/\">Badlands</a>&#8221; into &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/07/03/roll-of-the-dice-adam-raised-a-cain/\">Adam Raised a Cain</a>&#8221; &#8212; it was clear that we were going to have an intense performance that night. &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/05/28/roll-of-the-dice-something-in-the-night/\">Something in the Night</a>&#8221; was next up on the setlist, but Bruce abandoned it, playing &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/04/04/roll-of-the-dice-shes-the-one/\">She&#8217;s the One</a>&#8221; instead. Given the energy level of the crowd, that was a good choice, although it pained me to miss my favorite\u00a0<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/07/05/album-companion-darkness-on-the-edge-of-town/\"><em>Darkness</em> </a>track.</p>\n<p>Next came the first sign request of the evening&#8211;and it was a beauty. Patti saw it first and made sure that Bruce did, too&#8211;a request for &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/08/17/roll-of-the-dice-one-step-up/\">One Step Up</a>,&#8221; last played by the full band almost 26 years prior. The sign itself was an enlargement of Bruce and Patti singing the song in 1988 at a shared microphone, and clearly both the photo and the song brought up some strong memories for the two of them. The performance that followed was tender and sublime&#8211;one of the highlights not only of the show but of the tour. You&#8217;d never know they hadn&#8217;t performed it in a quarter of a century. You can&#8217;t tell from the video below, but from where we were, it was easy to see the tears in Patti&#8217;s eyes at the end of the song.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - One Step Up\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/neVEk4pdmkY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>From there, Bruce launched into a mini-Jazz Fest set, performing &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/07/10/roll-of-the-dice-cover-me-jesse-james/\">Jesse James</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/12/08/rotd-cover-me-how-can-a-poor-man-stand-such-times-and-live/\">How Can a Poor Man Stand Such Times and Live</a>&#8221; back to back. I absolutely adore the Seeger material, so I was thrilled by both selections&#8211;another highlight for a show that was still in its first third.</p>\n<p>Next, a return to the\u00a0<em>Wrecking Ball\u00a0</em>album for a couple of songs, and then Bruce threw out the setlist again, ditching &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/07/04/roll-of-the-dice-the-promised-land/\">The Promised Land</a>&#8221; for &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/10/31/roll-of-the-dice-night/\">Night</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/07/15/cover-me-o-mary-dont-you-weep/\">O Mary Don&#8217;t You Weep</a>&#8221; for a request of &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/11/18/roll-of-the-dice-no-surrender/\">No Surrender</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s talk about that &#8220;No Surrender&#8221; request: hardcore fans might groan at &#8220;wasting&#8221; a request on a song that&#8217;s played pretty often, but for those of us there, this was another of the evening&#8217;s top highlights.\u00a0 Two brothers wanted nothing more than to sing the song on-stage with Bruce, and they got their wish. They made the most of their moment, and the result was one of the most joyous moments I&#8217;ve ever witnessed at a Bruce concert. (And not for nothin&#8217;, when Bruce steps out onto the stage outcropping at the end of the song, you can clearly see me rocking out at about the 4:39 mark!)</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - No Surrender (Houston 05.06.14) HD\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MrDkVJ1iSjg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>More audibles followed, including my first &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/01/22/roll-of-the-dice-downbound-train/\">Downbound Train</a>&#8221; (completing the\u00a0<em>Born in the U.S.A. </em>album for me) and a beautiful &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/09/11/roll-of-the-dice-im-on-fire/\">I&#8217;m on Fire</a>,&#8221; followed by the evening&#8217;s &#8220;holy cow&#8221; moment: an ultra-rare performance of &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/01/30/roll-of-the-dice-all-or-nothing-at-all/\">All or Nothin&#8217; at All</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - All Or Nothin At All - live in Houston 2014\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zi90Z2UDxik?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>As the main set came to an end, the surprises still weren&#8217;t over: Bruce swapped out a set-closing &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/01/05/roll-of-the-dice-land-of-hope-and-dreams/\">Land of Hope and Dreams</a>&#8221; for &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/12/06/roll-of-the-dice-light-of-day/\">Light of Day</a>,&#8221; continuing high-energy, urgent vibe of the setlist.</p>\n<p>The only real puzzling moment of the show for came in the encore.
