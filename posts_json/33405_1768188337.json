It&#8217;s generally believed to have originated as a sea shanty, but in true folk fashion it&#8217;s likely that it was altered and adapted by sailors and seamen over the years to the point where the song&#8217;s geography makes no sense.</p>\n<p>Consensus dictates that &#8220;Shenandoah&#8221; originated with American and Canadian fur traders in the nineteenth century, but it had spread worldwide in popularity by the mid-1800s. The earliest known version was recorded in 1906 by Charles Rosher, and it can be heard (along with several other early incantations) in the video below, which also features a lot more historical background on the song.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"&quot;Shenandoah&quot; \u2013 Historical recordings of sailors and shantymen\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/h3fphQDlaZs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;Shenandoah&#8221; evolved and mutated so much over the years because it&#8217;s a stunningly beautiful song that lends itself to interpretation and creative arrangements. It&#8217;s inspired countless covers, including my all-time favorite released last year by Paula Cole.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Shenandoah\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BWFvQr-O1nA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Bruce&#8217;s version for\u00a0<em>We Shall Overcome\u00a0</em>is bucolic and delicate, almost gossamer at times. More than any other track except for the title one, &#8220;Shenandoah&#8221; reflects a respect and reverence for the source material that commands a listener&#8217;s rapt attention for a track that&#8217;s uncharacteristically stately.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Shenandoah (The Seeger Sessions)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fKI5_IRVeDM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Bruce&#8217;s album arrangement of &#8220;Shenandoah&#8221; seems too fragile to translate to the concert stage, which is probably why he avoided it for almost the entire Seeger Sessions Tour. But at one of the very last shows, the song made its first and only appearance to date.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Shenandoah, Dublin 2006\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9SBwk_wGyQk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Bruce&#8217;s live arrangement starts slowly. Accompanied only by his acoustic guitar at first (almost a capella at times), the song builds in beauty and power towards its climax. &#8220;Shenandoah&#8221; found an immediately receptive audience who listened intently and appreciatively, but the audience reaction wasn&#8217;t enough to prompt an encore performance the following nights.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Shenandoah&#8221; works best in its original incarnation, Bruce seemed to realize, and it&#8217;s likely that&#8217;s the only way we&#8217;ll hear it performed from now on&#8211;as a proud entry in the deep canon of covers of this American folk classic.</p>\n<p><b>Shenandoah</b><br />\n<b>Recorded:</b> March 19, 2005<br />\n<strong>Released:\u00a0</strong><em>We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions\u00a0</em>(2006)<br />\n<strong>First performed:</strong> November 18, 2006 (Dublin, Ireland)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> November 18, 2006 (Dublin, Ireland)</p>\n<p>\u00a9 March 22, 2022</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>Performed only once and buried deep within its album, Bruce&#8217;s version of &#8220;Shenandoah&#8221; is faithful and true to the song&#8217;s spirt.</p>\n", "protected": false}, "author": 1, "featured_media": 33434, "comment_status": "open", "ping_status": "open", "sticky": false, "template": "", "format": "standard", "meta": {"_monsterinsights_skip_tracking": false, "_monsterinsights_sitenote_active": false, "_monsterinsights_sitenote_note": "", "_monsterinsights_sitenote_category": 0, "jetpack_post_was_ever_published": false, "_jetpack_newsletter_access": "", "_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs": false, "_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id": 0, "_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content": false, "_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content": false, "footnotes": "", "jetpack_publicize_message": "", "jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled": true, "jetpack_social_post_already_shared": true, "jetpack_social_options": {"image_generator_settings": {"template": "highway", "default_image_id": 0, "font": "", "enabled": false}, "version": 2}}, "categories": [4, 3, 3608], "tags": [1892, 1263], "class_list": ["post-33405", "post", "type-post", "status-publish", "format-standard", "has-post-thumbnail", "hentry", "category-cover-me", "category-roll-of-the-dice", "category-wso", "tag-shenandoah", "tag-we-shall-over-come-the-seeger-sessions"], "aioseo_notices": [], "jetpack_publicize_connections": [], "jetpack_featured_media_url": "https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/shenandoah.webp?fit=2400%2C1350&ssl=1", "jetpack_sharing_enabled": true, "jetpack_shortlink": "https://wp.me/p9w3Lk-8GN", "jetpack_likes_enabled": true, "jetpack-related-posts": [{"id": 56191, "url": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2025/03/19/kingdom-of-days-march-19-2/", "url_meta": {"origin": 33405, "position": 0}, "title": "March 19", "author": "Ken", "date": "March 19, 2025", "format": false, "excerpt": "Bruce makes a Daily Show appearance, records tracks for the Seeger Sessions album, and closes out the L.A.
