To be fair, we&#8217;re forced to judge based solely on the lyrics&#8211;we do not know what style of accompaniment Bruce intended for these songs&#8211;and there are certainly many timeless songs that sound pretentious if recited as poetry rather than sung.</p>\n<p>Still, it&#8217;s hard not to wince a little at times. Let&#8217;s take a read.</p>\n<p>We should first note that the song is indeed a construction of nine &#8220;illusions.&#8221; Each brief verse presents a different dream, fantasy or metaphor, and all nine revolve around a &#8220;revelation&#8221; (although not the kind we expect). And in this respect, at least, Bruce succeeds at constructing his song&#8217;s framework.</p>\n<p>The illusions themselves, however, range from serviceable to painful&#8211;none of them match the level of songwriting Bruce had already proven himself capable of.</p>\n<p>The first two verses merely serve to establish the narrator&#8217;s despondent mood. (Note: I&#8217;ve taken the liberty to correct the misspellings in the original lyrics.)</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>As the walls of my wooden shack</em><br />\n<em>come crashing on my dreams</em><br />\n<em>Losing forever in the puzzles</em><br />\n<em>of time-faded memories</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>As the ancient oak tree</em><br />\n<em>stands shaking in the wind</em><br />\n<em>Silent in its timeless rest</em><br />\n<em>in her boughs loneliness sings</em></p>\n<p>Illusion #3 appears to be the closest thing we have to a chorus, at least establishing an A-A-B verse structure with parallel opening lines for the B verses. It also marks a lyrical shift, as Bruce now rouses from his reverie to address his love, who we suspect (based on the previous two verses) is no longer with him:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Do you remember the hours we spent listening to the rain?</em><br />\n<em>I felt the warmth of your tender love</em><br />\n<em>and never knew your name</em><br />\n<em>It didn&#8217;t matter, love was there just the same</em></p>\n<p>Bruce returns to increasingly fantastical imagery for the next three verses, and although there is at least one flash of inspiration (a wizard who changes the poetry of a loner), for the most part Bruce is grasping without latching onto metaphors for the pain of lost love.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>As the Wizard of the North</em><br />\n<em>flies through crimson skies</em><br />\n<em>Changing words stolen</em><br />\n<em>from a verse written by a lonely child</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>As the creatures of the Magic Forest</em><br />\n<em>lie crying in the sun</em><br />\n<em>Thinking of their friend</em><br />\n<em>who was lost to the hunter&#8217;s gun</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Do you remember the days we spent on the Eastern Gate?</em><br />\n<em>The aged shepherd of lost time</em><br />\n<em>showed us the dead loneliness in hate</em><br />\n<em>But things were good then, you were there with me again</em></p>\n<p>The song&#8217;s final third is the weakest. I almost feel bad sharing it, so again I feel compelled to point out: Bruce was eighteen (at most) when he wrote this song, there&#8217;s no evidence that these were final lyrics, and certainly no reason to believe he ever intended them to be widely read. So this is for historical purposes only:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>As the young flower lifts her head</em><br />\n<em>to live in the warmth of the sun</em><br />\n<em>The universe is hidden in her breast,</em><br />\n<em>her cries cry out for love</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>As I run through the golden fields</em><br />\n<em>that border the edge of my mind</em><br />\n<em>The Queen of Darkness comes riding by</em><br />\n<em>with diamonds in her eyes</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Do you remember the years we spent in the Palace of Sunshine?</em><br />\n<em>The elders taught us from century-old books</em><br />\n<em>The wind gifted us with a child, the night bid us welcome</em><br />\n<em>as we left to play amongst the stars during a winter&#8217;s revelation</em></p>\n<p>See what I mean? There is, however, one admirable aspect here worth noting: Bruce titles the song &#8220;A Winter&#8217;s Revelation,&#8221; but waits until the song&#8217;s last line before referencing it&#8211;and when he does, it&#8217;s clear that he&#8217;s fooled us. He leads us to expect an epiphany, a revelation in the &#8220;eureka&#8221; sense, but instead Bruce meant &#8220;reveal&#8221; in the &#8220;laying bare&#8221; sense.</p>\n<p>Because Bruce crafted the song out of fantastic imagery of the past, we don&#8217;t realize until the very end that he actually spends the song creating a barren landscape of the present, devoid of love and companionship. And\u00a0<em>that</em> is the winter&#8217;s revelation.</p>\n<p>We can clearly see what Bruce was aiming for, and it would have been a neat trick if he had pulled it off. Heck, it&#8217;s a neat trick even in the attempt. But &#8220;A Winter&#8217;s Revelation (In 9 Illusions)&#8221; requires stronger lyrics to meet the songwriter&#8217;s lofty goals, and at this point in time Bruce wasn&#8217;t quite there.</p>\n<p>But of course we know he would be before long.</p>\n<p><strong>A Winter&#8217;s Revelation (In 9 Illusions)<br />\nNever recorded</strong><br />\n<strong>Never performed</strong></p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
