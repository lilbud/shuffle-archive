[T]he people who we admired and emulated&#8211;which for me obviously begins with Dylan&#8211;had a very clear political voice. John [Fogerty] did it more subtly, but fabulously also.&#8221;\u00a0 <em>&#8211;Bruce Springsteen to Christopher Phillips, Backstreets, February 10, 2009</em></span></p></blockquote>\n<p>Bruce Springsteen has been a fan of John Fogerty for as long as he&#8217;s been playing music, calling Fogerty &#8220;the Hank Williams of my generation.&#8221; As early as his days in Child, Bruce included the music of Creedence Clearwater Revival in his sets. The River Tour famously included covers of &#8220;Who&#8217;ll Stop the Rain&#8221; and &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/04/05/cover-me-run-through-the-jungle/\">Run Through the Jungle</a>,&#8221; and in 1993 Bruce had the privilege of inducting John into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen Inducts Creedence Clearwater Revival\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dgpMGNVf9lw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>But at the dawn of the 21st century, it seemed for a while like John might have said all that he had to say. Seven long years went by without new music from Fogerty, until inspiration struck in an election year.</p>\n<p>In 2004, America was deeply divided over its leadership and involvement in a foreign war. That&#8217;s the environment that John Fogerty was built for. John met the moment by releasing a new album,\u00a0<em>Deja Vu All Over Again,\u00a0</em>with a terrific title track that compared the current conflict with the Vietnam War in a tone both jaded and pointed.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Deja Vu (All Over Again)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jiojReSUfLo?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>(If you get a sense of deja vu yourself while listening to the song, that&#8217;s probably because there are definite echoes of CCR&#8217;s &#8220;Have You Ever Seen the Rain&#8221; &#8212; an homage I&#8217;d like to think was intentional given the more recent song&#8217;s title.)</p>\n<p>&#8220;Deja Vu (All Over Again)&#8221; was a perfect song for the moment, so when John and Bruce joined forces later that year for the Vote For Change Tour in support of presidential candidate John Kerry, it was a perfect spotlight song for John on the set list.</p>\n<p>John played &#8220;Deja Vu (All Over Again)&#8221; nightly during the brief Vote For Change Tour, backed by Bruce and the E Street Band.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Deja Vu (All Over Again) - Bruce Springsteen &amp; John Fogerty (11-10-2004  MCI Center, Washington, DC)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-OTRcGiXIHE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>The Vote For Change shows were powerful and energizing, but ultimately ineffective&#8211;that year at least.</p>\n<p>It would take another four years before Americans would truly vote for change, and while Bruce and John would team up several more times over the decade that followed, they&#8217;d never play &#8220;Deja Vu (All Over Again)&#8221; again.</p>\n<p><strong>Deja Vu (All Over Again)<br />\nFirst performed:</strong> October 1, 2004 (Philadelphia, PA)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> October 13, 2004 (East Rutherford, NJ)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>When America found itself enmeshed in an unpopular foreign war (again), John Fogerty met the moment.
