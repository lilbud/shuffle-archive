It barrels out of the gate and never looks back. The somewhat sinister combo of Max Weinberg, Garry Tallent, and Clarence Clemons carry the song relentlessly on their backs, while Danny Federici&#8217;s happy-go-lucky farfisa rides above without a care in the world and The Big Man swaggers through his centerpiece solo.</p>\n<p>This is the E Street Band at their most cocksure. For an artist famous for arrangements that belie his lyrics, &#8220;Ramrod&#8221; features an absolutely perfect pairing.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Ramrod (The River Tour, Tempe 1980)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RJVauHVQ-X0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>And yet despite all that, I&#8217;d argue that to truly appreciate &#8220;Ramrod,&#8221; one must witness it. As much as or more so than any other song in Springsteen&#8217;s catalog, &#8220;Ramrod&#8221; is a visual song.

If you&#8217;re a gambler, feel free to place your bets now: odds are good we&#8217;ll be hearing &#8220;Ramrod&#8221; in concert throughout 2023.</p>\n<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> Widely considered to be a River-era song due to its inclusion on that album, &#8220;Ramrod&#8221; actually made its debut during the Darkness Tour two years earlier.
