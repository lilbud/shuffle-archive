I can&#8217;t answer that one. But it was the first song he soundchecked that afternoon as he sat at the pump organ he&#8217;d introduced to the stage only two weeks before.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"The Patriot Game  - May 17th, 2005 Soundcheck Tower Theater, Upper Darby, PA\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PaVu43aW6gA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>The pump organ was the perfect accompaniment for Behan&#8217;s dirge, and while Bruce may have been singing to an empty room, his vocals were yearning and earnest. The solitude in which he sang only served to underscore the song&#8217;s emotional impact.</p>\n<p>It was probably too obscure to make the main set, but Bruce&#8217;s performance of &#8220;The Patriot Game&#8221; is one of the strongest and most affecting covers he never officially performed.</p>\n<p><strong>The Patriot Game<br />\nFirst performed:</strong> May 17, 2005 (Upper Darby, PA) &#8211;
