In retrospect, I should have made those two different named cateogies.</p>\n<p>Similarly,\u00a0<em>Meeting Across the River\u00a0</em>never really found its identity. In the earliest days, it featured team-ups between Bruce and another artist covering Bruce&#8217;s own material, until I realized that would inevitably collide with the\u00a0<em>Roll of the Dice\u00a0</em>series.</p>\n<p>Then it became team-ups where Bruce and other artists covered someone else&#8217;s material. Sometimes the song was by the other artist, and sometimes the song was a cover for both of them.</p>\n<p>And then there were the studio recordings where Bruce made a guest appearance on a song written, recorded, and released by someone else. Can we even call those covers?</p>\n<p>So when I started the slow-roll transformation of blog to books, I decided to consolidate to just three series.</p>\n<p><em>Roll of the Dice</em> volumes would include all material originally released on a specific album, even if that meant including covers. I decided to also include notable covers by other artists of songs on that album.</p>\n<p><em>Kingdom of Days</em> would also include notable\u00a0<em>Where the Band Was\u00a0</em>entries where I thought the content was worth preserving.</p>\n<p>And then there are the\u00a0<em>Cover Me\u00a0</em>books, which would include all of the songs by other artists that Bruce covered, plus all <em>Meeting Across the River\u00a0</em>entries where the song in question isn&#8217;t one that Bruce authored.</p>\n<p>So somewhat belatedly, that&#8217;s the explanation for the same-but-different banners that grace the original blog version of these articles and the ones here in print.</p>\n<p>This volume features a hefty collection of team-ups, united by a loose theme: every essay focuses on a song originally recorded by (or at least closely associated with ) the featured artists.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s the largest Bookshelf Collection yet, and there&#8217;s enough material left over for an inevitable companion volume.</p>\n<p>Many of the essays were lightly retouched (especially some of the earliest ones), and there are two new ones (&#8220;Sandpaper&#8221; and &#8220;Will the Circle Be Unbroken&#8221;) included as a thank you to the subset of my readers who have enjoyed exploring Bruce&#8217;s sea of live and studio collaborations along with me.</p>\n<p>Thanks again for reading.
