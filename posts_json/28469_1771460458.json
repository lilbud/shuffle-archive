As the band pointed out when they debuted their video:</p>\n<p>&#8220;Springsteen once said of his song, &#8216;It did demand of you to hold two contradictory ideas in your mind at one time: that you could both be very critical of your nation and very prideful of your nation simultaneously.&#8217; That&#8217;s a lot of what our album is about.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The band strikes that balance well, and the result is one of the most musically and visually creative adaptations of &#8220;Born in the U.S.A.&#8221; to date, just as anthemic as Bruce&#8217;s original and just as critical, too.</p>\n<p>\u00a9 July 17, 2021</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>If you&#8217;re not familiar with Home Free, they&#8217;re an American a capella group that won Season 4 of\u00a0The Sing-Off on NBC back in 2013.
