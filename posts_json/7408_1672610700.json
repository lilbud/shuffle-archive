Bob Dylan&#8217;s soundtrack contribution to\u00a0<em>Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid</em> was an instant hit upon its release in 1973 (notching as high as #12 on the Billboard Hot 100), and covers started piling up almost immediately.</p>\n<p>From Eric Clapton in the seventies, to The Alarm in the eighties, to Guns N&#8217; Roses in the nineties to Avril Lavigne in the 2000s, both megastars and indie artists took their swing at covering it, but (IMO, anyway) Dylan&#8217;s original remains the definitive recording.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bob Dylan - Knockin&#039; On Heaven&#039;s Door (Official Audio)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rm9coqlk8fY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>(I have to give special mention to Ladysmith Black Mambazo&#8217;s team-up with Dolly Parton, however.

The most recent time was just four years ago when Bruce and Tom Morello performed it for Dylan himself at MusiCare&#8217;s tribute event. Dylan&#8217;s organization has put a fierce lid on that footage, but you can catch a few glimpses here:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bob Dylan: 2015 MusiCares Person Of The Year | GRAMMYs\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/scjD7h6v2Zc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>To see a full performance, however, we&#8217;ll have to travel a bit further back in time, to July 9, 1995, at Cafe Eckstein in Berlin.</p>\n<p>What was Bruce doing in Berlin in 1995? In one of his stranger career moves, Bruce decided to shoot an official video for his 1980 single &#8220;Hungry Heart,&#8221; but instead of recording it with the E Street Band, he joined German rocker and friend Wolfgang Niedecken&#8217;s Leopardefellband instead. Which would have been odd enough on its own, but in the actual released video, Bruce decided not to use any of the German band&#8217;s backing track&#8211;he reverted to the original E Street Band backing track instead.</p>\n<p>So now the official video for &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/12/21/roll-of-the-dice-hungry-heart/\">Hungry Heart</a>&#8221; has Bruce&#8217;s 1995 vocals layered on top of the 1980 E Street Band, all while Wolfgang and his band rock out silently on screen before an audience of lucky radio listeners who heard the open call for a free mini-concert earlier that day.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Hungry Heart (Berlin &#039;95 Version)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0My2AqPFpFg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer;

and (naturally) &#8220;Knockin&#8217; on Heaven&#8217;s Door.&#8221; And for <em>that</em> performance, we&#8217;re lucky enough to have both pro-shot video and actual audio.</p>\n<p>Enjoy.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Knocking on heavens door\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/B9zqCpPnOM4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer;
