Rarely do I encounter a cover that I actually like\u00a0<em>better</em> than Bruce&#8217;s original.</p>\n<p>But here&#8217;s one.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not surprising (at least not to me) that the track in question comes from\u00a0<em>Human Touch</em>. That album is full of great songs that go underappreciated, largely due (IMHO) to the album&#8217;s over-the-top production. &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/12/29/roll-of-the-dice-cross-my-heart/\">Cross My Heart</a>&#8221; is one of the rare\u00a0<em>Human Touch</em> tracks that doesn&#8217;t suffer from over-production&#8211;it&#8217;s actually pretty spare.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also pretty slow.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Cross My Heart&#8221; features some of Bruce&#8217;s most graphically sexual lyrics. Musically, though, while the original track sounds like it&#8217;s aiming for steamy and sultry, it never gets past a mild, meandering smoulder. The song doesn&#8217;t get its due as a result.</p>\n<p>Enter The Mandrillos.</p>\n<p>I know very little about this three-man combo. I have no idea where they&#8217;re from, and their barely-a-year-old social media pages don&#8217;t give many clues.</p>\n<p>But I do know that they absolutely nail &#8220;Cross My Heart,&#8221; preserving the original&#8217;s bass backbone while taking the pace up a notch and filling in the instrumental breaks with some terrific guitar solos.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe
