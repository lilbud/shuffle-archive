Bruce Hornsby? A forgotten acquaintance?</p>\n<p data-path-to-node=\"5\">Flowers figured it was probably a practical joke, but he soon learned it wasn&#8217;t. Bruce Springsteen had caught The Killers&#8217; set at Glastonbury the previous year and he was impressed by their performance of &#8220;Dustland Fairytale&#8221; in particular.</p>\n<p data-path-to-node=\"7\">In an Instagram post announcing their collaboration, Flowers revealed that he&#8217;d written the song &#8220;in the middle of [my mother&#8217;s] battle with cancer. It was an attempt to better understand my dad, who is sometimes a mystery to me. To grieve for my mother. To acknowledge their sacrifices and maybe even catch a glimpse of just how strong love needs to be to make it in this world. It was my therapy. It was cathartic.&#8221;</p>\n<p>\u201cBruce has written a lot about people like my parents and found a whole lot of beauty in otherwise invisible people\u2019s hopes and dreams\u2026 their struggles, and their losses. I\u2019m grateful to him for opening this door for me. I\u2019m grateful to my parents for their example to me. Now go find something new out about your dad, give your mom a big hug, and for God\u2019s sake listen to Bruce Springsteen.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s listen to Bruce Springsteen.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"758\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/M3BZ8hnLyRc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></div>\n<p>When Bruce&#8217;s gravelly baritone kicks in, he jolts the song from fairy tale to history, giving voice to Flowers&#8217; father and lacing his performance with aching empathy. It&#8217;s fitting, therefore, that Flowers dropped the &#8220;Fairytale&#8221; from the retitled &#8220;Dustland&#8221; when he released it to the world.</p>\n<p>Springsteen had spent his entire career writing about characters like Flowers&#8217; parents and had become indelibly associated with them. He must have instinctively known how his presence would affect the song when he suggested the collaboration.</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t just lend his voice; he lent his mythology. And in doing so, he turned a great song into a timeless performance\u2013a performance he reprised on stage in 2022 in a surprise appearance at The Killers&#8217; set in New York City.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"758\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QgIXt_mi9qA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></div>\n<p><strong>Dustland<br />\nRecorded:</strong> Late 2020<br />\n<strong>Released:</strong> &#8220;Dustland&#8221; (single, 2021)<br />\n<strong>First performed:</strong> October 1, 2022 (New York City, NY)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> October 1, 2022 (New York City, NY)</p>\n<p>\u00a9 February 23, 2026</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>&#8220;Dustland Fairytale&#8221; was always a Springsteen song in spirit.
