Patti&#8217;s been down that ladder many times.</p>\n<p>We all have that ladder, though. Bruce&#8217;s may be particularly deep and well-traveled, but at one time or another, we all fall down it. Patti&#8217;s no exception, as she reveals in &#8220;Black Ladder,&#8221; and her song is at heart a pledge of devotion between two partners willing to make the trip down each other&#8217;s ladder when needed and guide the other back up.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Black Ladder&#8221; is a beautiful, powerful song, and a perfect capstone for a collection of songs breathtaking in their blend of bravery and vulnerability.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also a an extraordinarily deep cut, even for the most devoted fan.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s why it was a shock and surprise when Elvis Costello chose &#8220;Black Ladder&#8221; for his set list when Bruce made a guest appearance on Elvis&#8217;\u00a0<em>Spectacle\u00a0</em>series in 2009. Patti wasn&#8217;t present, and her album was already two years old by that point, so Elvis&#8217; inclusion was purely an expression of admiration and appreciation.</p>\n<p>Accompanied by both Bruce and Nils on guitar (in a superb mix), Elvis took the lead vocal and did Patti proud with an achingly beautiful rendition.</p>\n<div id=\"v-viP0odNS-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='426' src='https://videopress.com/embed/viP0odNS?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>This was the first and only time Bruce has played &#8220;Black Ladder&#8221; in concert.
