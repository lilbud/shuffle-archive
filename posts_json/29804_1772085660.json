In order to beat Carr to the record store shelves, Spector called in The Blossoms, a local group fronted by Darlene Love.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s The Blossoms we hear on the studio recording of &#8220;He&#8217;s a Rebel,&#8221; even though The Crystals received the official credit. Love and The Blossoms eventually received their due recognition, and today &#8220;He&#8217;s a Rebel&#8221; ranks among <em>Rolling Stone&#8217;s\u00a0</em>500 Greatest Songs of All Time. More significantly, the song introduced the &#8220;bad boy&#8221; anti-hero to pop music, and rock and roll would never be the same.</p>\n<p>So it was only fitting for Darlene to perform &#8220;He&#8217;s a Rebel&#8221; at her Hall of Fame induction. The surprise was that it turned out to be a duet.</p>\n<p>After Love performed &#8220;Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah&#8221; and &#8220;(Today I Met) The Boy I&#8217;m Gonna Marry,&#8221; Bette Midler returned to the stage to join Darlene in a faithful rendition of her greatest and only #1 hit, backed by Paul Shaffer and the CBS Orchestra.
