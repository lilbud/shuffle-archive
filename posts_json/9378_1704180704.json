Freed from the overly lavish production and arrangements that weighed down much of <em>Human Touch</em>, &#8220;Lucky Town&#8221; saunters its way over the rise. It&#8217;s also an intensely personal song not just lyrically, but musically: Bruce plays every instrument on the tracks but the drums.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s the second song on the album that bears its name, but the opening track &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/03/17/roll-of-the-dice-better-days/\">Better Days</a>&#8221; (a brilliant song in its own right) feels unnaturally ebullient by comparison. &#8220;Lucky Town&#8221; feels more natural, Bruce sounds more at ease, and the use of a minor key melody set against hopeful lyrics is a clever twist on Bruce&#8217;s more common reverse formula.</p>\n<p>The first verse reads like a deliberate &#8220;Hungry Heart&#8221; callback, with a hero who doesn&#8217;t know where he&#8217;s going, but he knows he has to go:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well, house got too crowded, clothes got too tight</em><br />\n<em>And I don&#8217;t know just where I&#8217;m going tonight</em><br />\n<em>Out where the sky&#8217;s been cleared by a good hard rain</em><br />\n<em>There&#8217;s somebody calling my secret name</em></p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what we don&#8217;t yet realize: the reason that house is so crowded, is because\u00a0<em>we&#8217;re in it</em>.\u00a0The house is a metaphor for Bruce&#8217;s audience; his &#8220;clothes&#8221; are his stage persona.</p>\n<p>We can read that verse as either professional (Bruce felt pigeon-holed, stagnant, and restless, so he disbanded the E Street Band in a good hard rain and set out to find a new style), or we can read it as personal (Bruce needed more than fame and fortune in his life; he needed and found someone who saw and recognized his true self, his secret name).</p>\n<p>Either way, he may not know where he&#8217;s going, but he&#8217;s telling us he&#8217;ll know it when he sees it.</p>\n<p>The second verse extends the metaphor established in the first verse:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Had a coat of fine leather and snakeskin boots</em><br />\n<em>But that coat always had a thread hanging loose</em><br />\n<em>Well I pulled it one night and to my surprise</em><br />\n<em>It led me right past your house and on over the rise</em></p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s pause for a moment on that last line, because it&#8217;s significant. Bruce has just told us that his clothes, while very nice, have started to fray. (He does love those snakeskin boots, though, doesn&#8217;t he? How many songs have <em>those</em> turned up in?) So he pulled on that loose thread, and notice where it led him: not <em>to</em> his love&#8217;s house, but\u00a0<em>past\u00a0</em>it. In other words, while he needs love and family in his life, he&#8217;s not escaping <em>to</em> them&#8211;he&#8217;s collecting them and taking them <em>with</em> him.</p>\n<p>And it&#8217;s here that we realize that &#8220;Lucky Town&#8221; isn&#8217;t a love song, but rather a re-dedication song&#8211;an affirmation to both his personal and professional lives. He&#8217;s learned hard lessons, and he&#8217;s stronger for it:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well I had some victory that was just failure in deceit</em><br />\n<em>Now the joke&#8217;s coming up through the soles of my feet</em><br />\n<em>I been a long time walking on fortune&#8217;s cane</em><br />\n<em>Well tonight I&#8217;m stepping lightly and feeling no pain</em></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s hard not to read the first couplet of the bridge as anything but a wry commentary on his first marriage, and the second is clearly an embrace of the freedom that came with walking away from mega-stardom at the height of it.</p>\n<p>The final verse is a celebration of self-determination and the sweet satisfaction that comes from taking the hard road:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well here&#8217;s to your good looks baby, now here&#8217;s to my health</em><br />\n<em>Here&#8217;s to the loaded places that we take ourselves</em><br />\n<em>When it comes to luck, you make your own</em><br />\n<em>Tonight I got dirt on my hands but I&#8217;m building me a new home</em></p>\n<p>Those final lines still resonate years later, and as a personal credo you could do a lot worse. The luck we make, Bruce sings, is better than the fortune we take. It&#8217;s harder, but it&#8217;s genuinely yours.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>&#8220;Lucky Town&#8221; made its official live debut at an intimate, private show for Sony insiders; the rest of us were introduced to it when Bruce played it as his first-ever performance on\u00a0<em>Saturday Night Live</em>, more than a month before he kicked off his world tour.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Lucky Town (9-5-1992, Rehearsal)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kisUZm1yMpQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>If you couldn&#8217;t stay up late enough for SNL or forgot to record it, your next chance to see Bruce perform it for free was on his episode of <em>MTV Unplugged</em>.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Lucky Town (MTV Plugged - Official HD Video)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LJaU_6swr60?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;Lucky Town&#8221; has made sparing appearances since the 1992-93 touring years, and most of those were on Bruce&#8217;s solo acoustic tour in 2005.
