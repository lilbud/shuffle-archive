As of this writing, he has more than two million YouTube subscribers&#8211;40% more than Bruce can claim, by the way&#8211;and over five\u00a0<em>billion</em> lifetime views.</p>\n<p>Yet even though he&#8217;s been releasing online content constantly for more than a dozen years, it wasn&#8217;t until a few weeks ago that he covered Bruce Springsteen.</p>\n<p>On Independence Day, Tyler released a cover of &#8220;Born in the U.S.A.,&#8221; and with as many followers as he has, it didn&#8217;t need to be good to get attention.</p>\n<p>But holy moly, this is a <em>damn</em> good cover&#8211;vibrant yet poignant, simmering and seething with carefully contained emotion until it just explodes with anguish and protest.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"758\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/We1BzUZCeJQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></div>\n<p>Ordinarily, I&#8217;d say that Ward doesn&#8217;t need promotion from a little blog like mine. But I suspect Springsteen fans aren&#8217;t in his target demographic, because compared with his most popular videos, Ward&#8217;s version of &#8220;Born in the U.S.A.&#8221; is an absolute sleeper with only 8,000 or so views.</p>\n<p>So do your favorite Springsteen fan a favor and point them toward this wonderful rendition. Tyler Ward&#8217;s &#8220;Born in the U.S.A.&#8221; immediately leaps onto my list of favorite Springsteen covers ever.</p>\n<p>\u00a9 August 4, 2021</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>YouTube O.G. superstar finally turns his attention to Bruce&#8217;s music, and the result is spectacular.</p>\n", "protected": false}, "author": 1, "featured_media": 28690, "comment_status": "open", "ping_status": "open", "sticky": false, "template": "", "format": "standard", "meta": {"_monsterinsights_skip_tracking": false, "_monsterinsights_sitenote_active": false, "_monsterinsights_sitenote_note": "", "_monsterinsights_sitenote_category": 0, "jetpack_post_was_ever_published": false, "_jetpack_newsletter_access": "", "_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs": false, "_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id": 0, "_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content": false, "_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content": false, "footnotes": "", "jetpack_publicize_message": "", "jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled": true, "jetpack_social_post_already_shared": true, "jetpack_social_options": {"image_generator_settings": {"template": "highway", "default_image_id": 0, "font": "", "enabled": false}, "version": 2}}, "categories": [3611, 4], "tags": [2237, 3235], "class_list": ["post-28458", "post", "type-post", "status-publish", "format-standard", "has-post-thumbnail", "hentry", "category-bitusa", "category-cover-me", "tag-born-in-the-u-s-a", "tag-tyler-ward"], "aioseo_notices": [], "jetpack_publicize_connections": [], "jetpack_featured_media_url": "https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/tyler.jpg?fit=900%2C900&ssl=1", "jetpack_sharing_enabled": true, "jetpack_shortlink": "https://wp.me/p9w3Lk-7p0", "jetpack_likes_enabled": true, "jetpack-related-posts": [{"id": 7800, "url": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/1984/01/20/cover-me-richard-shindell-born-in-the-u-s-a/", "url_meta": {"origin": 28458, "position": 0}, "title": "Richard Shindell: Born in the U.S.A.", "author": "Ken", "date": "January 20, 1984", "format": false, "excerpt": "Richard Shindell's arrangement of \"Born in the U.S.A.\" highlights the anger and loss in the lyrics without sacrificing the melody.
