The song is loaded with life experience that requires a nuanced, empathic vocal performance that typically only comes to performers far, far into their careers.</p>\n<p>So when he sat down to cover it, James Gooch made an incredibly ballsy decision that frankly appalled me initially&#8211;but which upon reflection strikes me as a wise move.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll say no more until you listen to it for yourself.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Reflekter - Moonlight Motel (Cover)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HauSPkqQm3A?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>See what I mean?</p>\n<p>My first reaction was: How??? How could you possibly remove the bridge and that heartbreaking final verse? You stripped out the poignancy that makes the song so powerful. Without it, we&#8217;re left with just a song about youthful love affair.</p>\n<p>And then suddenly I understood.</p>\n<p>When Gooch sings that first verse, his vocal isn&#8217;t time-worn or filled with longing for the past. It&#8217;s fresh.\u00a0The love he sings about is new. He and his love really are two of the young folks who up and disappear in the motel.</p>\n<p>And when the motel is abandoned in the second verse, Gooch is singing of a love that flamed out just as quickly as it flamed up. This wasn&#8217;t a life-long love like the one that Bruce sings about, but when we&#8217;re young, those first relationships make up in intensity what they lack in longevity.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m closer age-wise to Bruce than to James, with a marriage almost as old as Bruce&#8217;s. So when I listen to this version of &#8220;Moonlight Motel&#8221; I can&#8217;t help but feel like it&#8217;s missing its heart and soul.</p>\n<p>But Gooch doesn&#8217;t share that life experience, so it wouldn&#8217;t surprise me if it&#8217;s the passion of the youthful affair itself that resonated with him rather than the distant memory. So that&#8217;s what he focuses on in his cover, excising the parts that root the song in the far future. It&#8217;s a gutsy decision, and a risky one.</p>\n<p>My mantra on this blog regarding Springsteen covers has always been: make it better, or make it your own.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s possible to do &#8220;Moonlight Motel&#8221; better. (See my <a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/09/30/roll-of-the-dice-moonlight-motel/\">essay</a> for why I think it&#8217;s one of Bruce&#8217;s very best songs and performances across his entire career.)</p>\n<p>But Gooch certainly makes it his own.</p>\n<p>What do you think?</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>James Gooch&#8217;s acoustic cover of &#8220;Moonlight Motel&#8221; is the first Western Stars cover I&#8217;ve featured on this blog, and it&#8217;s bound to be a controversial one.
