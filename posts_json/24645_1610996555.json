He did it all: He played, he sang, he wrote. He would have been a bigger star but Jerry Lee came along. And you know what happens when someone like that comes along. You just don\u2019t stand a chance.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">So Billy became what is known in the industry &#8212; a condescending term, by the way &#8212; as a one-hit wonder. But sometimes, just sometimes, once in a while, a one-hit wonder can make a more powerful impact than a recording star who\u2019s got 20 or 30 hits behind him.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">He did it with style and grace. You won\u2019t find him in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. He\u2019s not there. Metallica is. Abba is. Mamas and the Papas &#8212; I know they\u2019re in there. Jefferson Airplane, Alice Cooper, Steely Dan &#8212; I\u2019ve got nothing against them. Soft rock, hard rock, psychedelic pop. I got nothing against any of that stuff, but after all, it is called the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Billy Lee Riley is not there. Yet. &#8212;\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><em>Bob Dylan,\u00a0</em></span><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">February 2015</span></p></blockquote>\n<p>We feature a lot of obscure covers here on the Shuffle, but today we&#8217;re pushing the envelope with a cover of a song that was never a hit by an artist that never made it big. Oh, and technically Bruce didn&#8217;t even cover it&#8211;he just soundchecked it twice, ten years apart.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re not familiar with the story of Billy Lee Riley, you&#8217;re probably also not a subscriber to Andrew Hickey&#8217;s excellent and essential podcast,\u00a0<em>A History of Rock in 500 Songs</em>. Go check out <a href=\"https://www.500songs.com/e/episode-57-flying-saucers-rock-n-roll-by-billy-lee-riley/\">Episode 57</a> for the full and fascinating backstory on one of rock&#8217;s great unsung influencers, and if you&#8217;re a student of rock history, consider subscribing while you&#8217;re there. I learn new things from Andrew every week. (Plug over now.)</p>\n<p>Anyway, suffice it to say that Riley had a knack for being in the wrong place at the wrong time, and when he wasn&#8217;t he was probably at least doing the wrong thing. He had a couple of almost-hits in &#8220;Flying Saucers Rock and Roll&#8221; and &#8220;Red Hot&#8221; in 1957, but Riley was never able to translate his regional successes into national ones. But he was a rockabilly pioneer, and he shaped the sound of Sun Records. Riley&#8217;s story intertwined with Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Cash, The Beach Boys, Glen Campbell and many other artists whose recordings he contributed to and influenced.</p>\n<p>By the time Riley released &#8220;Is That All to the Ball (Mr. Hall),&#8221; in 1958, his popularity had already peaked. Good luck finding reviews or references to it&#8211;even in modern profiles of Riley, it&#8217;s rarely mentioned.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"IS THAT ALL TO THE BALL, MR.
