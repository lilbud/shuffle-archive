I learned a lot, and I am deeply appreciative.</p>\n<p>All things end, though, and soon this site will too.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what the months ahead look like:</p>\n<p><strong>Already in effect: </strong>All commenting has been disabled site-wide for version control as I work on archiving the site. I did this a few days ago, and I apologize for not acknowledging it sooner.</p>\n<p><strong>Now through January 5, 2026: </strong>Kingdom of Days will continue its daily publication schedule. The last post will be on January 5th, which marks the official end of the series&#8217; eighth year. That seemed like a nice place to tie the bow..</p>\n<p>Concurrently, I&#8217;ll be reviewing every Roll of the Dice, Cover Me, Meeting Across the River, and other posts I&#8217;ve published over the last eight years in preparation for archiving. I&#8217;ll repair or replace any broken links or media, update live performance statistics, etc. so the articles are as clean as possible. For previously unreleased tracks that are now available on <em>Tracks II: The Lost Albums</em>, I will note the additional release in the article footer but will not revisit the main text other than to correct factual statements in light of the official release. I expect this work to be completed by December 31st.</p>\n<p><strong>January 6, 2026: </strong>This site essentially becomes a zombie, while I make a personal, offline archive of the site. I will also delete the entire subscriber database on this date so there&#8217;s no retention of your email address (if you are a subscriber).</p>\n<p>What happens after that is still a little fuzzy. At some point in 2026, this site will completely vanish, but\u00a0 I don&#8217;t know exactly when that will happen. When I started this site, I went through a gradual process of licensing the software, web hosting, domain names, plugins, backup service, media hosting, etc., and I don&#8217;t remember when those all come up for annual renewal.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m basically just going to let everything expire organically, and whatever link in the chain breaks first will likely be what takes the site down. I started seriously considering creating a blog toward the end of 2017, so I&#8217;m guessing the blog will be a decaying zombie for most of next year. Regardless, I won&#8217;t be monitoring or maintaining it. (Zombies are gross.)</p>\n<p>But of course we&#8217;ll always have Paris, thanks to the <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20140601000000*/estreetshuffle.com\">Wayback Machine</a>.</p>\n<p>So that&#8217;s that.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll send another update/reminder as the end approaches, but for now:</p>\n<p>Thanks again for reading, today and for as much of the last eight years as you&#8217;ve been with me.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>It&#8217;s a long goodbye, but the end of this blog is coming.</p>\n", "protected": false}, "author": 1, "featured_media": 61136, "comment_status": "closed", "ping_status": "open", "sticky": false, "template": "", "format": "standard", "meta": {"_monsterinsights_skip_tracking": false, "_monsterinsights_sitenote_active": false, "_monsterinsights_sitenote_note": "", "_monsterinsights_sitenote_category": 0, "jetpack_post_was_ever_published": false, "_jetpack_newsletter_access": "", "_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs": false, "_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id": 0, "_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content": false, "_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content": false, "footnotes": "", "jetpack_publicize_message": "", "jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled": true, "jetpack_social_post_already_shared": true, "jetpack_social_options": {"image_generator_settings": {"template": "highway", "default_image_id": 0, "font": "", "enabled": false}, "version": 2}}, "categories": [1], "tags": [], "class_list": ["post-61083", "post", "type-post", "status-publish", "format-standard", "has-post-thumbnail", "hentry", "category-uncategorized"], "aioseo_notices": [], "jetpack_publicize_connections": [], "jetpack_featured_media_url": "https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/endnear.webp?fit=474%2C355&ssl=1", "jetpack_sharing_enabled": true, "jetpack_shortlink": "https://wp.me/p9w3Lk-fTd", "jetpack_likes_enabled": true, "jetpack-related-posts": [{"id": 15454, "url": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2025/01/01/year-two-complete/", "url_meta": {"origin": 61083, "position": 0}, "title": "Introduction", "author": "Ken", "date": "January 1, 2025", "format": false, "excerpt": "We're two years old!
