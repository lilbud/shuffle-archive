<p>Days before their appearance at a Hurricane Sandy relief concert in Asbury Park, My Morning Jacket premiered their note-perfect cover of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/12/21/roll-of-the-dice-hungry-heart/">Hungry Heart</a>” at their New Year’s Eve show in Boston. (They played it in AP, too.)</p>
<p>It’s a wonderfully faithful cover without a trace of irony or self-consciousness. There’s even a horn section.</p>
<p>I’m pretty certain Bruce would approve.</p>
