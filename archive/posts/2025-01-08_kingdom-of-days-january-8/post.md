**1970**: After driving across the U.S., Steel Mill auditions for a gig at The Family Dog on The Great Highway in San Francisco. They are rejected.

**1971:** Temporarily without a band (Bruce disbanded Steel Mill in December), Bruce appears at the Upstage in Asbury Park as one of headliner Steve Van Zandt’s “friends.” Other friends on stage include Garry Tallent, Danny Federici, and Southside Johnny. Who knew there was espresso in New Jersey in 1971?

**1973**: Bruce plays Boston for the first time as he begins a seven-night, two-shows-daily run at Paul’s Mall, opening for David Bromberg. Promotional ads get his name wrong, though, and it won’t be the last time people mistakenly call him “Rick.”

**1983:** For a brief but glorious run, Big Man’s West was a center of gravity for the Jersey Shore Music scene. Owned by Clarence Clemons and managed by Bruce’s personal assistant Terry Magovern, the Springsteen connections were strong. Bruce played the small nightclub at least eighteen times during its eighteen-month life, along with Southside Johnny, John Eddie, Joan Jett, Bonnie Raitt, and others. On this final night in 1983, Bruce, Clarence, Max and Garry join Lance Larson on stage for covers of “Rockin’ All Over the World” and “[Lucille](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/11/29/cover-me-lucille/).” Big Man’s West closes immediately after, but the E Street Band will use the empty space to rehearse for the *Born in the U.S.A.* Tour the following year.

**1984**: Bruce stops by the Stone Pony in Asbury Park for amateur comedy night. The crowd coaxes him onstage to participate and then promptly boos him off after he bombs. Later that night, he returns to his comfort zone, hopping back onstage to join Cats on a Smooth Surface for covers of “Lucille” and “[Carol](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/02/17/cover-me-carol/).”

**1985**: Bruce plays the second of two nights at the Market Square Arena in Indianapolis. This night would have been Elvis’ 50th birthday, and in his memory Bruce plays his first U.S. performance of “[Can’t Help Falling in Love](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/05/06/cover-me-cant-help-falling-in-love/).”
