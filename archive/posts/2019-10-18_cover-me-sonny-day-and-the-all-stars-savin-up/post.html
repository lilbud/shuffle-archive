<p>It’s obscure covers week here on the Shuffle. First, we had “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/09/26/roll-of-the-dice-the-angel/">The Angel</a>” by <a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/10/14/cover-me-the-blue-bonnets-the-angel/">The Blue Bonnets</a>, but at least Bruce officially released that song. Today’s entry can’t even claim that.</p>
<p>If you don’t hail from New Zealand, perhaps you’re not familiar with the late, great Sonny Day. (I wasn’t until this song.)</p>
<p>Day was a staple of the New Zealand rock, blues, and soul scene for decades, even though his recordings were infrequent.</p>
<p>Day’s biggest hit came in 1985, with a cover of Bruce Springsteen’s “<a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/05/14/roll-of-the-dice-cover-me-clarence-clemons-savin-up/">Savin’ Up</a>.”</p>
<p>“Savin’ Up” was as obscure then as it is now–it’s only other appearance on an album is its original 1983 outing by Clarence Clemons and the Red Bank Rockers. I don’t know if Day had a connection to either Bruce or Clarence, but somehow the song came to his attention.</p>
<p>Day covered the song in the studio with the All Stars, a group of accomplished Auckland session musicians, and filmed a video on the streets of Auckland. Check it out:</p>

<p>Yes, it’s about as eighties as you can get, but it’s a fantastic performance that’s so true to the Springsteen sound that I’d nominate Day’s version as the definitive recording of the song.</p>
