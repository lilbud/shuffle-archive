<p>Here’s an undeservedly obscure Bruce cover that deserves much wider exposure:</p>
<p>In 2007, Jimmy Eat World released their sixth studio album, <em>Chase This Light</em>, and this frenetic, impossible-not-to-dance-to cover of “<a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/03/29/roll-of-the-dice-take-em-as-they-come/">Take ‘Em as They Come</a>” was a bonus track exclusively for iTunes customers.</p>
<p>If you missed it then, give it a listen now–but first, turn the volume up and get your dancing shoes on, because this one <em>rocks.</em></p>
