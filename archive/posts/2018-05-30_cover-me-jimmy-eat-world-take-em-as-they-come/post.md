Here’s an undeservedly obscure Bruce cover that deserves much wider exposure:

In 2007, Jimmy Eat World released their sixth studio album, *Chase This Light*, and this frenetic, impossible-not-to-dance-to cover of “[Take ‘Em as They Come](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/03/29/roll-of-the-dice-take-em-as-they-come/)” was a bonus track exclusively for iTunes customers.

If you missed it then, give it a listen now–but first, turn the volume up and get your dancing shoes on, because this one *rocks.*
