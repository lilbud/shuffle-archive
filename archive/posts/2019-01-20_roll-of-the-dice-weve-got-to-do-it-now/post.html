<p>What to say about “We’ve Got to Do It Now…”</p>
<p>Well, for starters: it’s one of the few early, early unreleased Springsteen songs for which we have both a high-quality live recording <em>and</em> hand-written song lyrics (which fetched $1,195 in a 2008 auction). So that’s pretty cool.</p>

<p>Also, “We’ve Got to Do It Now” is unusual in its shared lead vocals. You can hear Bruce trade off with Robbin Thompson in their 1970 performance as Steel Mill below.</p>

<p>But that’s pretty much all that’s remarkable about this <em>very</em> of-its-time composition. This one, as they say, is for the completists.</p>
<p>Honestly, it’s a pretty weak song. The sentiment is admirable: it’s a call to metaphorical arms, with Bruce and Robbin exhorting their cohorts to choose love not war (or at least to <em>choose</em> period):</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Well, come with me brothers, come with me sisters</em><br/>
<em>The time has come, we’ve got to help each other</em><br/>
<em>So pick up your guns or send out your lovers</em><br/>
<em>The choice is yours, it’s one or the other</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Now hurry up before it’s too late</em><br/>
<em>There’s even no time to waste</em><br/>
<em>The sooner it’s done, I know, the better</em><br/>
<em>So longer we wait the harder they’ll make it for us to get together</em></p>
<p>But that message was also delivered by many other musicians of that era, typically in a more artful fashion.</p>
<p>In fact, the lyrics are <em>so</em> atypical of Bruce’s writing at the time that I suspect they were a co-writing exercise. (The handwritten lyrics are in Bruce’s handwriting, but we don’t have any record of where, when, or by whom the song was actually invented).</p>
<p>There is one verse in particular that sounds like early Bruce–and differs enough from the preceding ones to lend credence to co-authorship:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>There’s no backing out cause you’re already in</em><br/>
<em>The choice is yours, you have to make it my friend</em><br/>
<em>You’re branded as an outlaw and set on the run</em><br/>
<em>Hunted by soldiers marked as the one</em></p>
<p>The notion of being cast as an “outlaw”–specifically the use of that term–is a theme that comes up often in Bruce’s very western-influenced writing at the time. The sudden shift of focus and tone from peace and love to the very real consequences of refusing to participate in a morally unjust war–that sounds like Bruce as well.</p>
<p>But we’ll probably never know, and it would rank pretty close to the bottom of things I’d ever ask Bruce about if I had the chance.  “We’ve Got to Do It Now” is likely to remain a historical curiosity.</p>
