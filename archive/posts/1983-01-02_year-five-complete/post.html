<p>This is a ghost story.</p>
<p>A ghost story, and also a cautionary tale. But it started out as a musical comedy.</p>
<p>In 1962, Elvis Presley was already an established movie star. He was a prolific one, too: he starred in no less than three films that year.</p>
<p>First out of the gate was <em>Follow That Dream, </em>hyped by the studio as Elvis’ “funniest, happiest, dreamiest motion picture!”</p>
