<p>This is a ghost story.</p>
<p>A ghost story, and also a cautionary tale. But it started out as a musical comedy.</p>
<p>In 1962, Elvis Presley was already an established movie star. He was a prolific one, too: he starred in no less than three films that year.</p>
<p>First out of the gate was <em>Follow That Dream, </em>hyped by the studio as Elvis’ “funniest, happiest, dreamiest motion picture!”</p>

<p>Elvis recorded six songs for the movie, four of which were released on a soundtrack EP, including the film’s title track, a bouncy rockabilly confection that peaked at #15 on the Billboard Hot 100.</p>

The boy had little interest in rock and roll, but he loved movies and jumped at chance to see one being made. Elvis noticed the young set visitor and spent a few minutes talking to him, igniting a brand new passion  in the boy. From that day forward, little Tom Petty was determined to be a rock and roll star when he grew up.)</p>
<p>“Follow That Dream” (the original version) is sun-drenched and care-free, a paean to persistence and a prayer for companionship along the way.</p>

<p>And of course, that’s exactly what Elvis did. The Beatles arrived in America two years after <em>Follow That Dream</em>, and by the late 1960s, Elvis’ popularity started to decline.
