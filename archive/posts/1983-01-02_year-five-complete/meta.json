But it started out as a musical comedy.</p>\n<p>In 1962, Elvis Presley was already an established movie star. He was a prolific one, too: he starred in no less than three films that year.</p>\n<p>First out of the gate was <em>Follow That Dream, </em>hyped by the studio as Elvis&#8217; &#8220;funniest, happiest, dreamiest motion picture!&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Follow That Dream | 1962 | Theatrical Trailer\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ljm1EqLxAGk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Elvis recorded six songs for the movie, four of which were released on a soundtrack EP, including the film&#8217;s title track, a bouncy rockabilly confection that peaked at #15 on the Billboard Hot 100.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Follow That Dream (Remastered)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zD0xsv2BHFw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>(Little known but true story: during the filming of <em>Follow That Dream</em>, a crew member named Earl Jernigan brought his ten-year-old nephew to the set to meet The King. The boy had little interest in rock and roll, but he loved movies and jumped at chance to see one being made. Elvis noticed the young set visitor and spent a few minutes talking to him, igniting a brand new passion \u00a0in the boy. From that day forward, little Tom Petty was determined to be a rock and roll star when he grew up.)</p>\n<p>&#8220;Follow That Dream&#8221; (the original version) is sun-drenched and care-free, a paean to persistence and a prayer for companionship along the way.</p>\n<p>The song&#8217;s intro and outro set the tone:\u00a0<em>Keep a-moving, move along!</em></p>\n<p>And of course, that&#8217;s exactly what Elvis did. The Beatles arrived in America two years after <em>Follow That Dream</em>, and by the late 1960s, Elvis&#8217; popularity started to decline. A comeback television special re-established him, but his body couldn&#8217;t meet the demands his touring schedule placed on it.</p>\n<p>He began using and then abusing prescription drugs to help him perform, and then additional ones to help him sleep. His mental health began to decline along with his physical health, but his finances, his self-image, and his sense of duty to his fans and management kept him moving, moving along.</p>\n<p>He was trapped on a treadmill until he finally collapsed and died in 1977.</p>\n<p>Elvis&#8217; death had a profound effect on Bruce Springsteen, whose star was just starting to rise at the moment Presley&#8217;s went out.
