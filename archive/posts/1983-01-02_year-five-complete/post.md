This is a ghost story.

A ghost story, and also a cautionary tale. But it started out as a musical comedy.

In 1962, Elvis Presley was already an established movie star. He was a prolific one, too: he starred in no less than three films that year.

First out of the gate was *Follow That Dream,* hyped by the studio as Elvis’ “funniest, happiest, dreamiest motion picture!”

And of course, that’s exactly what Elvis did. The Beatles arrived in America two years after *Follow That Dream*, and by the late 1960s, Elvis’ popularity started to decline. A comeback television special re-established him, but his body couldn’t meet the demands his touring schedule placed on it.

He began using and then abusing prescription drugs to help him perform, and then additional ones to help him sleep. His mental health began to decline along with his physical health, but his finances, his self-image, and his sense of duty to his fans and management kept him moving, moving along.

He was trapped on a treadmill until he finally collapsed and died in 1977.
