In a concert filled with Orbison classics, “The Comedians” is an outlier. It was written by Elvis Costello and released on Costello’s 1984 album, 

*Goodbye Cruel World.*

Orbison recorded a cover of “The Comedians” but hadn’t released it at the time of his 1987 all-star concert. Two years later, Orbison was gone, but “The Comedians” made its debut posthumously on Orbison’s final album, 

*Black & White Night* *Mystery Girl.*

Roy’s 1987 performance remains the definitive version, however. Bruce takes a backing guitar role on it, and Elvis Costello actually appears as a backing vocalist. So is it a cover or a team-up? You decide.
