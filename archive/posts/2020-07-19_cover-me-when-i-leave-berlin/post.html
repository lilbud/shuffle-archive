<blockquote><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">“Once in a while you play a place, a show that ends up staying inside of you, living with you for the rest of your life. East Berlin in 1988 was certainly one of them.” — <em>Bruce Springsteen, May 30, 2012</em></span></p></blockquote>
<p>In 1988, Bruce Springsteen played to about 160,000 East Germans (and by some estimates up to 300,000)–roughly one percent of East Germany’s entire population.</p>
<p>Much has been written (including an entire book) about that history-making and history-shaping show; it’s widely considered to be one of the accelerators that led to the removal of the Berlin Wall the following year.</p>
<p>Bruce doesn’t often talk about that show, but we certainly know it made an impression on him, because almost a quarter-century later he paid tribute to it when he opened his second-biggest German show ever with a cover of Wizz Jones’ 1973 folk song, “When I Leave Berlin,” a song written from the perspective of an East German yearning for the freedom of the west.</p>

<p>When Bruce started playing it, unannounced except as “something we learned just for you” it seemed clear that most of the crowd didn’t recognize it, but Bruce knows his craft: all it takes is the first mention of the name of your current location in song to get an audience revved up.</p>
<p>Had Bruce chosen to use its original arrangement, “When I Leave Berlin” might have fallen flat, but Bruce wisely leveraged the full power of his band–horn section and all–and gave the song an energetic Seeger Sessions-esque treatment.</p>

<p>If you paid close attention to the original and cover versions above, you might have noticed that Bruce made a subtle but significant lyrical change as well:</p>
<p>In the original version, the chorus begins with “Here today, but the wall is open, there are flowers alongside the dunes.”</p>
<p>Bruce changed the back half of that line to “gone are the soldiers and their guns” — just in case the meaning of the original lyrics weren’t as obvious so many years down the road.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful performance for an appreciative audience–just one of the many times Bruce shows his appreciation for his local audiences through song.</p>
