East Berlin in 1988 was certainly one of them.\u201d &#8212; <em>Bruce Springsteen, May 30, 2012</em></span></p></blockquote>\n<p>In 1988, Bruce Springsteen played to about 160,000 East Germans (and by some estimates up to 300,000)&#8211;roughly one percent of East Germany&#8217;s entire population.</p>\n<p>Much has been written (including an entire book) about that history-making and history-shaping show; it&#8217;s widely considered to be one of the accelerators that led to the removal of the Berlin Wall the following year.</p>\n<p>Bruce doesn&#8217;t often talk about that show, but we certainly know it made an impression on him, because almost a quarter-century later he paid tribute to it when he opened his second-biggest German show ever with a cover of Wizz Jones&#8217; 1973 folk song, &#8220;When I Leave Berlin,&#8221; a song written from the perspective of an East German yearning for the freedom of the west.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Wizz Jones - &quot;When I Leave Berlin&quot;\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iR1qH4Rztig?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer;

it seemed clear that most of the crowd didn&#8217;t recognize it, but Bruce knows his craft: all it takes is the first mention of the name of your current location in song to get an audience revved up.</p>\n<p>Had Bruce chosen to use its original arrangement, &#8220;When I Leave Berlin&#8221; might have fallen flat, but Bruce wisely leveraged the full power of his band&#8211;horn section and all&#8211;and gave the song an energetic Seeger Sessions-esque treatment.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"When I Leave Berlin (Berlin 05/30/12)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MsjkqHT0O-o?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer;

&#8212; just in case the meaning of the original lyrics weren&#8217;t as obvious so many years down the road.</p>\n<p>It was a beautiful performance for an appreciative audience&#8211;just one of the many times Bruce shows his appreciation for his local audiences through song.</p>\n<p><strong>When I Leave Berlin<br />\nFirst performed:</strong> May 30, 2012 (Berlin, Germany)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> May 30, 2012 (Berlin, Germany)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>Almost a quarter-century after Bruce&#8217;s legendary show in East Germany, Bruce honored his Berlin audience&#8217;s history by opening his Wrecking Ball show with Wizz Jones&#8217;
