When Southside Johnny released his first solo album in 1988, he called upon his old friend Bruce Springsteen to help him close out the record. The album's final song is a moody ballad called "Walking Through Midnight" co-written by Southside and Bruce.

Southside penned the lyrics, and Bruce composed the music. Neither of them brought their A game to it, though: the late-night wandering lyrics aren't particularly inspired, and the backing track is about as late-eighties pop as it gets.

Still, any Lyon/Springsteen collaboration is worth at least one listen, even one as under the radar as "Walking Through Midnight."

(And we're talking seriously under the radar here: If either of them have ever performed the song live, I'm not aware of it.)
