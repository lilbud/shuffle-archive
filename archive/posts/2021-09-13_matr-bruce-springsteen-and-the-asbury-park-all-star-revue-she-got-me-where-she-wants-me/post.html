<p>If you were in Red Bank on the evenings of May 12th and 13th, 1977, you had a chance to witness in person a one-time only alignment of stars: the Asbury Jukes and the E Street Band playing a show together, with Steve Van Zandt out in front for most of the show, Bruce mostly in a supporting role, and Southside Johnny missing in action altogether.</p>
<p>The shows were originally billed with Southside Johnny as the headliner, but when Southside got sick and couldn’t perform, Van Zandt organized a rescue mission to save the Jukes’ four-show stand at the Monmouth Arts Center.</p>
<p>Assembled on stage that night were the Asbury Jukes, the E Street Band, Bruce Springsteen, and Ronnie Spector, performing a mix of Southside’s and Spector’s classics with a four-song Springsteen encore.</p>
<p>Although Bruce took lead vocals on his own songs, for most of the night he stayed on backing vocals and guitar while Steve played the frontman.</p>
<p>Was Steve up to the task? Heck yes. Take a listen to one of the many highlights from that night, “She Got Me Where She Wants Me,” from Southside’s new (at the time) album, <em>This Time It’s For Real</em>.</p>

<p>At that point, Southside’s new album had only been out a few weeks, but Steve led the band through the song like it was made for him.</p>
<p>That’s probably because it was made <em>by</em> him. Steve wrote, arranged, and produced “She Got Me Where She Wants Me” along with most of the songs on the album. An obvious homage to the classic R&amp;B groups (a few of whom appear on the album), “She Got Me Where She Wants Me” is a quintessential Van Zandt track, and one of my favorites from an album full of them.</p>

<p>As for Southside, he was back in action pretty quickly. Here he is back where he belongs two months after that All-Star Revue rescue mission, leading his band through “She Got Me Where She Wants Me” in Asbury Park.</p>
