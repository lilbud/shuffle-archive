Heck yes. Take a listen to one of the many highlights from that night, &#8220;She Got Me Where She Wants Me,&#8221; from Southside&#8217;s new (at the time) album, <em>This Time It&#8217;s For Real</em>.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Little Steven and Bruce Springsteen : she got me where she wants me\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DlAj4jJK2os?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>At that point, Southside&#8217;s new album had only been out a few weeks, but Steve led the band through the song like it was made for him.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s probably because it was made\u00a0<em>by</em> him. Steve wrote, arranged, and produced &#8220;She Got Me Where She Wants Me&#8221; along with most of the songs on the album. An obvious homage to the classic R&amp;B groups (a few of whom appear on the album), &#8220;She Got Me Where She Wants Me&#8221; is a quintessential Van Zandt track, and one of my favorites from an album full of them.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"She Got Me Where She Wants Me\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vdeQm8GXomY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>As for Southside, he was back in action pretty quickly.
