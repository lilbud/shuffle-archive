Even when the band kicks in after the first chorus, our attention stays fixated on Bruce and Suki.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"I Want You (Live)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/UJs0Whh5qSA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Those few fans old enough now and hip enough then to have caught the E Street Band during that pre-fame period recall the on-stage heat between Bruce and Suki.
