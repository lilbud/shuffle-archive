That feat led to a recording contract with Columbia Records, where they became label-mates with Bruce.</p>\n<p>A few weeks back, they released their latest album on their own label,\u00a0<em>Land of the Free,\u00a0</em>a patriotic collection of country and rock classics, capped off with Bruce&#8217;s 1984 protest hit. And I mean patriotic, not jingoistic. As the band pointed out when they debuted their video:</p>\n<p>&#8220;Springsteen once said of his song, &#8216;It did demand of you to hold two contradictory ideas in your mind at one time: that you could both be very critical of your nation and very prideful of your nation simultaneously.&#8217; That&#8217;s a lot of what our album is about.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The band strikes that balance well, and the result is one of the most musically and visually creative adaptations of &#8220;Born in the U.S.A.&#8221; to date, just as anthemic as Bruce&#8217;s original and just as critical, too.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>Okay, just\u00a0one\u00a0more post before I go back to vacation mode, because this new cover of &#8220;Born in the
