<p><em>The Nebraska Sessions</em> is neither the first nor the last project to pay tribute to Bruce’s famous 1982 solo project, but it may be the only one recorded the same way Bruce did: on a TEAC Tacsam four-track cassette recorder.</p>
<p>Each track was interpreted and performed by a different artist or band, and in a nod to more modern times, Moss captured each performance on video as well.</p>
<p>The entire album is worth listening to, but my favorite track by far is the daring reinvention of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/10/28/roll-of-the-dice-open-all-night/">Open All Night</a>” by Mad Staring Eyes.</p>

<p>Mad Staring Eyes was a six-piece folk combo out of North London that counted Bruce among their influences. (They don’t seem to be active any more, although I’d be happy to be corrected if they are.)</p>
<p>Their shuffling take on “Open All Night” would have been a perfect arrangement for the Seeger Sessions Tour, had Bruce not gone a completely different direction with his own re-imagining of the song.</p>
<p>Their entire performance is great, but for me the highlight is the rocking flute solo(!), very likely inspired by Canned Heat. Who would have thought “Going Up the Country” would graft well onto “Open All Night?”</p>
