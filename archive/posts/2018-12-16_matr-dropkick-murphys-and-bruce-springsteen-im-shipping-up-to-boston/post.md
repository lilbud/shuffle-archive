Dropkick Murphys co-wrote “I’m Shipping Up to Boston” with Woody Guthrie. Seriously.

On St. Patrick’s Day in 2011, Bruce shipped up to Boston to perform it with the original artists–his one and only performance of the song to date. It was a fantastic performance, captured in great quality. Check it out below.
