But there&#8217;s still much to admire and appreciate about &#8220;Candy&#8217;s Boy,&#8221; especially its richness as a lyrical source for some of Bruce&#8217;s much-loved songs.</p>\n<p>Candy&#8217;s earliest known appearance is in a 1976 rehearsal at Bruce&#8217;s house, captured on film in remarkable clarity by Barry Rebo.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Candy&#039;s Boy (Holmdel, NJ 76) (from Thrill Hill Vault 1976-1978)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8O1t90tgjjI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Even in this early prototype, we can hear in almost-finished form the first verse of &#8220;Candy&#8217;s Room&#8221;; the only substantive change between this rehearsal and the final vinyl is the substitution of Candy&#8217;s pop culture heroes for Jesus in her wall decorations.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>In Candy&#8217;s room, there are pictures of her savior on the wall</em><br />\n<em>But to get to Candy&#8217;s room, you got to walk the darkness of Candy&#8217;s hall</em><br />\n<em>Strange men from the city call Candy&#8217;s number and bring Candy toys</em><br />\n<em>But when I come knocking she smiles pretty, because she knows tonight I&#8217;m gonna be Candy&#8217;s boy</em></p>\n<p>But after that famous first verse, we leave the familiar behind to take a ride down Route 9 to a cheap motel, out by a location that would eventually serve as\u00a0 a set for &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/10/24/roll-of-the-dice-prove-it-all-night/\">Prove It All Night</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Now in the olden days when the Mongolian gangs rode on Route 9</em><br />\n<em>We go running scared in the shivering rain, settle down south through the pines</em><br />\n<em>Dark weekends in the sun in that cheap motel out by the Dynamo</em><br />\n<em>We loved each other till there was nothing left, and we drove that old car as hard and fast as she would go</em></p>\n<p>Only the bridge sounds a bit unfinished: the first line is a bit awkward, but the second inverts the &#8220;Candy&#8217;s Room&#8221; narrator&#8217;s bravado to pure pathos:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well I got a cool summer wind, oh Candy you know I needed you</em><br />\n<em>But now Candy&#8217;s got a man who takes care of her better than I do</em></p>\n<p>The final verse introduces a menacing element to the proceedings&#8211;it would appear that at least one of Candy&#8217;s clients has underworld connections, and he&#8217;s not happy about her betrayal. Our determined hero doesn&#8217;t mind, though; he&#8217;s playing the long game, counting on their survival.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well there&#8217;s machines and there&#8217;s fire watching at night in Candy&#8217;s eyes</em><br />\n<em>And there&#8217;s some bad boys for hire, they&#8217;re gonna blow us because Candy lies</em><br />\n<em>Well let them do their worst, because when it&#8217;s all done and we&#8217;re in the street</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;ll come knocking and you&#8217;ll smile pretty because I&#8217;ll be Candy&#8217;s boy if she wants me to be</em></p>\n<p>A year later, Bruce and the E Street Band revisited Candy in the studio, and one of those takes would eventually be released&#8211;more than three decades later&#8211;on\u00a0<em>The Promise</em>.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Candy&#039;s Boy\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kyX31Y8O-20?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>The first two verses of the officially released version hew pretty closely to the 1976 rehearsal, with only minor changes that require no deep analysis.</p>\n<p>Starting with the bridge, however, the variations become more significant. The cool summer wind becomes a cold winter one&#8211;a small change that transforms an atmospheric detail into a metaphorical harbinger.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well I got a cold winter wind blowing in behind me and you</em><br />\n<em>But Candy&#8217;s got a man who takes care of her better than I do</em></p>\n<p>Although the final verse still ends the song on a hopeful note, the cold winter wind telegraphs to us the narrator&#8217;s naivete: we immediately recognize that this story will <em>not</em> end well.</p>\n<p>Because Bruce devised a way for the bridge to do the heavy storytelling lifting, he was then able to dial back the cynicism of the final verse.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well there&#8217;s machines and there&#8217;s fire waiting for us on the edge of town</em><br />\n<em>And there&#8217;s some rough boys for hire and they&#8217;re waiting to blow me and Candy down</em><br />\n<em>That&#8217;s all right &#8217;cause they can&#8217;t touch us now and destroy</em><br />\n<em>My sweet love, I will forever be Candy&#8217;s boy</em></p>\n<p>Gone is the reference to Candy&#8217;s lies or any sense of betrayal. The bad boys are now merely &#8220;rough,&#8221; more existential menaces than true-life ones. The narrator is more hopeful and less passive, but he&#8217;s just as naive as in the earlier version.</p>\n<p>Bruce must have known he was on to something in that first couplet&#8211;while it wouldn&#8217;t survive in the final version of &#8220;Candy&#8217;s Room,&#8221; he would adapt it for &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/02/27/roll-of-the-dice-drive-all-night/\">Drive All Night</a>&#8221; and liberate it almost verbatim for an early version of &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/03/31/roll-of-the-dice-frankie/\">Frankie</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"VideoPress Video Player\" aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='426' src='https://videopress.com/embed/LmknH3DW?hd=1&amp;cover=1' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script src='https://v0.wordpress.com/js/next/videopress-iframe.js?m=1658470809'></script></p>\n<p>Lyrically, the song ends at this point, but musically it continues for almost two full minutes on the back of Danny Federici&#8217;s glorious organ solo (accompanied by himself on glockenspiel). This is one of Danny&#8217;s finest moments on record; his solo is absolutely essential to the song, conveying the blind but buoyant optimism, adoration, and naivete of the narrator so earnestly that we <em>almost</em> believe that he and Candy will live happily ever after. (He&#8217;d do the same thing almost two decades later on &#8220;Across the Border&#8221; to even more powerful effect.)</p>\n<p>In the end, Bruce abandoned &#8220;Candy&#8217;s Boy,&#8221; stripping it for parts rather than releasing it on an album. There seems to be a fan consensus that he made the right choice. Certainly a case can be made for Candy&#8217;s stronger character definition in the later &#8220;Candy&#8217;s Room&#8221; (the earlier &#8220;Candy&#8217;s Boy&#8221; is completely narrator-centric).</p>\n<p>And yet, &#8220;Candy&#8217;s Room&#8221; has always sounded like a composite to me, long before I&#8217;d learned of its genetic splicing history with &#8220;The Fast Song.&#8221;\u00a0 &#8220;Candy&#8217;s Boy&#8221; is a simpler song with less shading, but its narrator&#8217;s fatal innocence has always charmed me and its backing track always struck me as a better fit for its lyrics.</p>\n<p>So don&#8217;t ask me which is the stronger song&#8211;at least not yet. We&#8217;ll pick up this thread further on down the road.</p>\n<p><em><strong>To be continued in &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/01/30/roll-of-the-dice-the-fast-song/\">The Fast Song</a>&#8221;\u00a0</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> There are several studio outtakes of &#8220;Candy&#8217;s Boy&#8221; floating around out there, all variations recorded in June 1977.
