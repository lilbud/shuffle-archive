<p>I realize that Springsteen covers are a mixed bag; just because we love the song when performed by its original artists doesn’t mean the song translates well to others.</p>
<p>But trust me on this: stop what you’re doing for a minute, and listen to this absolutely gorgeous cover of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/06/01/roll-of-the-dice-if-i-should-fall-behind/">If I Should Fall Behind</a>,” one of Bruce’s finest songs. It’s brand new (released just days ago as I write this), but it’s immediately cemented as one of my top ten Springsteen covers of all-time.</p>

<p>I’m unfamiliar with Danny Gone’s original work, but you can bet I’m going to seek it out after listening to his tender arrangement and mesmerizing performance.</p>
<p>Well done, Mr. Gone. <em>Very</em> well done.</p>
