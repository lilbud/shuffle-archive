Ah, “Mystery Train.” It’s so easy to find snippets of it in Bruce’s performances over the years. It shows up scores of times, from “…”

But a full performance of the Junior Parker blues turned Elvis Presley rockabilly classic is a lot harder to come by. Parker’s original was released in late 1953:

But it was Elvis’ cover that probably first caught Bruce’s attention. Released not even two years later in 1955, it established Elvis as a country star as well as a rock and roll star, and it sits high on the list (#77) of 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list.

You’d think that after quoting it dozens of times in concert, Bruce would have relished the chance to play it with the E Street Band in full.

But Bruce’s first performance of “Mystery Train” in its entirety didn’t come until 1995, and even then it was “only” an ensemble performance with Sting, James Taylor, Elton John, Billy Joel, Jon Bon Jovi, Paul Simon, and others, and essentially one long extended chorus.

He reportedly played it a second time three years later at his birthday party with musicians who would eventually become the Seeger Sessions Band, but no recording of that performance has surfaced. Ditto for a third performance at a charity benefit in October 2000.

On December 18, 2000, Bruce played it for a fourth time–this time with the Max Weinberg 7 plus Nils, Garry, Patti, Soozie, Southside Johnny, and Lisa Lowell–but it was during a soundcheck for that night’s holiday show in Asbury Park. “Mystery Train” didn’t make it to the evening’s set list, but at least we have–finally–a great recording of Bruce performing the song in full (with some great harp-playing by Southside):

But it wasn’t until 2003 that fans got to hear Bruce sing “Mystery Train” with the E Street Band. On the evening of August 1, two days after the passing of Sam Phillips (who produced both the Junior Parker and Elvis versions of the song), Bruce opened his encores with his first “proper” tour performance of “Mystery Train,” dedicated to Phillips.

Why did it take so long for Bruce to cover a song he’d quoted, excerpted, and mashed up so many times? And why hasn’t he played it since? It’s a… well, you know.
