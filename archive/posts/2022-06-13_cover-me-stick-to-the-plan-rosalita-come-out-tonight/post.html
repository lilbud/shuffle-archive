<p>The entries for this year’s <em>Cover Me</em> competition in Bergamo are rolling in, and there are some truly outstanding ones vying for the top prize. It’s no surprise that today’s entry is among them.</p>
<p>Last year, a band called The Folding Chairs took the top spot with <a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/06/04/cover-me-the-folding-chairs-new-york-city-serenade/">their bluegrass arrangement</a> of “New York City Serenade.” It was one of my favorite entries, and both the judges and the audience seemed to agree.</p>
<p>The Folding Chairs are absent this year, but lead singer Ettore Cardamellis is back with a new group called Stick to the Plan! (punctuation intentional), but with a similar Seeger-esque sound.</p>
<p>And come on: haven’t you always wondered what a Seeger-fied (with a little bit of Blues Traveller) version of “Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)” would sound like?</p>
<p>Of course you have. So let’s watch, listen, and enjoy.</p>

<p>Like their performance? We’re still a few months away from the final competition, so stay tuned this summer for more spotlight features on some of Europe’s most talented, Springsteen-inspired artists.</p>
