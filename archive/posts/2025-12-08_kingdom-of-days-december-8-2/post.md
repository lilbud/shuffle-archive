**1980:** Bruce and the boys play their second of three River Tour nights at the Philadelphia Spectrum. Earlier that Day, John Lennon gave an interview praising "[Hungry Heart](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/12/21/roll-of-the-dice-hungry-heart/)" as his current favorite song. It would prove to be his last favorite song: while Bruce is on stage performing tonight, John Lennon is murdered in New York City.
