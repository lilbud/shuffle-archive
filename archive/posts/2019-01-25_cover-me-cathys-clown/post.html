<p>When the Everly Brothers released “Cathy’s Clown” in 1960, it quickly went to #1 in both the U.S. (for five weeks) and U.K. (for seven). Billboard ended up ranking it at #3 for the entire year, and it would prove to be the Everlys most successful single ever and their final #1 hit.</p>

<p>It’s not a love song, or even a happy song; it’s a song about being dumped and wounded pride. That might seem like a strange candidate for a number one song, but since it’s an experience most of us have had, perhaps it resonated strongly.</p>
<p>It certainly was a good thematic fit for Bruce’s setlist on the Tunnel of Love Express Tour, which is probably why he was caught soundchecking it one spring afternoon in Tacoma.</p>
<p>Bruce never did play it that night–or <em>any</em> night ever–but we can eavesdrop on that 1988 soundcheck and hear how Bruce might have approached and arranged it if he did.</p>
