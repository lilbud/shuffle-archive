<p>It’s one of the most beautiful and true love songs ever written covered by perhaps the most gorgeous voice to ever grace a studio.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWTjIfqrdiI">Watch on Youtube: Linda Ronstadt -If I Should Fall Behind</a></p>
<p>Linda Ronstadt covered Bruce Springsteen’s “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/06/01/roll-of-the-dice-if-i-should-fall-behind/">If I Should Fall Behind</a>” on her final rock album, <em>We Ran</em>, in 1998. Her arrangement starts sparer and finishes lusher than Bruce’s studio track, but her vocals stand out throughout–as warm and heartfelt as the song deserves.</p>
<p>Linda followed it up the next year with a lovely duet on “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/09/06/roll-of-the-dice-across-the-border/">Across the Border</a>” with Emmylou Harris that garnered more attention, but for my money the lesser-heard track is the stronger one.</p>
<p>We can only wonder what else she might have brought to Bruce’s catalog had her career not been tragically cut short.</p>
