What more is there to say about this one?

It’s one of the most beautiful and true love songs ever written covered by perhaps the most gorgeous voice to ever grace a studio.

Linda Ronstadt covered Bruce Springsteen’s “[If I Should Fall Behind](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/06/01/roll-of-the-dice-if-i-should-fall-behind/)” on her final rock album, *We Ran*, in 1998. Her arrangement starts sparer and finishes lusher than Bruce’s studio track, but her vocals stand out throughout–as warm and heartfelt as the song deserves.

Linda followed it up the next year with a lovely duet on “[Across the Border](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/09/06/roll-of-the-dice-across-the-border/)” with Emmylou Harris that garnered more attention, but for my money the lesser-heard track is the stronger one.

We can only wonder what else she might have brought to Bruce’s catalog had her career not been tragically cut short.
