On the day after Thanksgiving in 1976, Bruce spent the evening in New York City with Patti Smith at The Bottom Line.

Patti performed two shows that night, and Bruce made was on stage for much of both of them, starting with this improvisational piece that Patti performed at the early show, accompanied by Bruce on piano. It's come to be known as "Slowly Walking Down the River" after its repeated lyrics, but it's more memorable for her pre-song explanation of why she was late to appreciate Bruce's music...
