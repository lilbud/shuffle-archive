<p>On International Worker’s Day 2014, Bruce opened his show in Tampa on a sober note with a one-time only performance of the Labor Union anthem, “I Dreamed I Saw Joe Hill Last Night.”</p>

<p>Bruce’s performance was a fitting way to honor the occasion. Joe Hill was a leading labor activist and organizer, accused of murder (perhaps falsely, as the song describes) exactly a century before Bruce paid tribute and executed the following year.</p>
<p>The song itself draws its lyrics from the Alfred Hayes poem by the same name; Earl Robinson turned it into a song in 1936.</p>

<p>Paul Robeson and Pete Seeger brought the song to a wider audience through their musical and political activism. The newsreel below captures a remarkably clear and powerful performance by Robeson before a group of Scottish miners, and you can feel how much the song means to its audience.</p>

<p>Generation after generation, socially conscious performers have kept the song alive, first Robeson and Seeger, then (famously) Joan Baez at Woodstock:</p>

<p>…and most recently–but not finally–Bruce’s performance on the High Hopes Tour. The song lives on because the need for it lives on. “Joe Hill” remains a powerful reminder of the importance of collective action and fortitude for workers who fight for fairness.</p>
