That always struck me as a particularly cruel thing for Bruce to do: although thematically related, &#8220;Tunnel of Love&#8221; is such a vastly smarter, more mature and just plain superior song that &#8220;Two For the Road&#8221; underwhelms just by mere proximity.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Two For The Road (Single B-Side - 1987)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1MIzyU5OzNM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Still, there are interesting tasting notes on which we should linger for a moment or two:</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s start with the title. We&#8217;ve looked at so many Springsteen songs with titles inspired by movies and books that I&#8217;ve lost count. &#8220;Two For the Road&#8221; is another one, inspired by the 1967 romantic comedy starring Audrey Hepburn and Albert Finney.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s move on to the lyrics:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>It&#8217;s one for the money and one for the show</em><br />\n<em>I got one kiss for you honey so come on let&#8217;s go</em><br />\n<em>I didn&#8217;t see it coming but girl now I know</em><br />\n<em>It takes one for the running but two for the road</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>One thousand dreams whispered in the dark</em><br />\n<em>But a dream&#8217;s just a dream in one empty heart</em><br />\n<em>It takes more than one to rev it up and go</em><br />\n<em>So let&#8217;s get it running, we&#8217;re two for the road</em></p>\n<p>Notice the repeated occurrence of the word &#8220;running&#8221; in the final lines of each verse. That&#8217;s almost certainly Bruce drawing a direct connection between &#8220;Two For the Road&#8221; and &#8220;Born to Run.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Is this the same narrator from Bruce&#8217;s signature song more than a dozen years earlier, now older and wiser? Quite possibly. Or maybe it&#8217;s simply a metatextual aside&#8211;Bruce&#8217;s way of telling us that he&#8217;s matured now that he&#8217;s settled down (&#8220;Two For the Road&#8221; was written during Bruce&#8217;s first marriage). If &#8220;Born to Run&#8221; was about an escape artist, the protagonist of &#8220;Two For the Road&#8221; is a travel companion.</p>\n<p>If Bruce had carried the comparison all the way through the song, &#8220;Two For the Road&#8221; might have made for a rewarding and nostalgic reconnection with a long lost friend. Unfortunately, he quickly abandons the notion.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Two one-way tickets and a diamond ring</em><br />\n<em>Hell it don&#8217;t matter what the rain might bring</em><br />\n<em>Whoa, when this world treats you hard and cold\u00a0</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;ll stand beside you, we&#8217;re two for the road</em></p>\n<p>The bridge is a callback as well&#8211;just to a different song. &#8220;This world treats you hard and cold&#8221; features prominently in the bridge of &#8220;Two Hearts.&#8221; (It works better there, too.)</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>When you&#8217;re alone my love&#8217;ll shine the light</em><br />\n<em>Through the dark and starless night</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;ll hold you close and never let you go</em><br />\n<em>C&#8217;mon now girl &#8217;cause we&#8217;re two for the road</em><br />\n<em>Well it&#8217;s two to get ready, babe, c&#8217;mon let&#8217;s go</em><br />\n<em>Me and you, girl, we&#8217;re two for the road</em></p>\n<p>Honestly, I have nothing to add about the third verse. It&#8217;s pedestrian. If you ever need a rare example of Bruce phoning in lyrics, the last verse of &#8220;Two For the Road&#8221; is about as strong a candidate as you&#8217;ll find.</p>\n<p>Surprisingly, Bruce has played &#8220;Two For the Road&#8221; in concert no less than five times&#8211;always (wisely) solo and acoustic. All but one of those performances were during the summer and autumn legs of Bruce&#8217;s Devils &amp; Dust Tour, when Bruce challenged himself (and sometimes his audience) by playing at least one song each night he&#8217;d never played before.</p>\n<p>One of those debuts was &#8220;Two For the Road,&#8221; first surfacing in August in Cincinnati and Seattle, then again in November back home in New Jersey, all performed by Bruce solo on the electric piano. Here&#8217;s Bruce&#8217;s last uneven performance of &#8220;Two For the Road&#8221; from the penultimate show of the 2005 tour.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - TWO FOR THE ROAD 2005 live\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JjM3f_5NBAU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;Two For the Road&#8221; wouldn&#8217;t be heard from again for almost a decade, until it made a solitary appearance at Bruce&#8217;s post-High Hopes show in Pittsburgh with Joe Grushecky.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen-&quot;Two For The Road&quot;-first live rendition on acoustic guitar,\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1TE4DDehPMM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Bruce has never seemed fully comfortable with &#8220;Two For the Road,&#8221; and it&#8217;s a difficult song to slot into a set list without it feeling shoehorned.
