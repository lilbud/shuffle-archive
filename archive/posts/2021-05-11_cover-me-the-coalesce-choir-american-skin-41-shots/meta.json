He reached out to his artistic network and built a musical coalition called The Coalesce Choir to raise money and awareness for Black Lives Matter.</p>\n<p>Domenic had his musicians, and he found his engineer and co-producer in Steve Carr. He had a song in mind, too: Bruce Springsteen&#8217;s &#8220;American Skin (41 Shots).&#8221;</p>\n<p>A self-professed huge Springsteen fan, Domenic told me, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think I realized how long it had been since the Amadou Diallo murder. When I did realize, I think it just added to my frustration. I wanted to do the song but I wanted it to be a community statement and not just me&#8230;\u00a0 I envisioned a treatment that maintained the power of the original tune but had that &#8216;raise your voices&#8217; impact.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The finished track definitely makes the impact Domenic strove for. It&#8217;s every bit as powerful as Bruce&#8217;s original but lifted even higher through the seamlessly interwoven contributions of the assembled voices and musicians. (Domenic sings the lead on the verses.)</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"American Skin (41 Shots)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NOOTMpXhtbU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>If you like The Coalesce Choir&#8217;s version of &#8220;American Skin (41 Shots),&#8221; consider <a href=\"https://thecoalescechoir.com/store\">buying it as a download</a>.
