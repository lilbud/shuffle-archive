<p>Katee Cross is a country singer-songwriter from Scotland with four well-received albums to her credit. She’s also a great cover artist, able to find and feed the heart of a song while bringing something fresh and new to it.</p>
<p>Here’s a perfect example: her 2016 performance of Bruce Springsteen’s “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/08/08/roll-of-the-dice-tougher-than-the-rest/">Tougher Than the Rest</a>.”</p>

<p>Katee infuses Bruce’s world-weary song with a vibrant, optimistic, light-on-its-feet riff that introduces us to a narrator who is newly in love and fully awakened. Her performance captures those first moments of self-discovery, when we realize we <em>are</em> still capable of loving again after all.</p>
<p>It’s a very different take than Bruce’s, and it casts the song in an entirely different emotional light–but a light just as romantic.</p>
<p>“Tougher Than the Rest” may be one of Bruce’s most frequently covered songs, but Katee’s arrangement and performance elevates this cover to the ranks of the very best versions.</p>
