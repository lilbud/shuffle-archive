Bruce's original recording of "[Ain't Got You](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/08/30/roll-of-the-dice-aint-got-you/)" is spare–almost a capella–but its Bo Diddley beat has always cried out for a funkified arrangement.

Thankfully, multiple Grammy-nominated Robert Randolph & The Family Band were more than up to the challenge.

When asked to participate in a tribute radio show for Bruce's 70th birthday last year, Randolph crafted an "Ain't Got You" arrangement around his incredible pedal steel prowess, and turned in a performance that's absolutely irresistible.

Turn up the volume and clear the floor–you'll be dancing to this one.
