<p>I don’t know much about The Blue Bonnets other than that they contributed to the excellent <em>For You</em> Italian tribute album back in 1995.</p>
<p>But their contribution wasn’t just another of the countless “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/09/11/roll-of-the-dice-im-on-fire/">I’m on Fire</a>” or “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/12/25/roll-of-the-dice-dancing-in-the-dark/">Dancing in the Dark</a>” renditions out there… these guys get serious bonus points for digging <em>deep</em> in Bruce’s catalog and selecting a song that almost no one ever touches: “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/09/26/roll-of-the-dice-the-angel/">The Angel</a>,” from Bruce’s very first album.</p>
<p>Not many fans would rank “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/09/26/roll-of-the-dice-the-angel/">The Angel</a>” very high in Bruce’s catalog, but if Bruce had arranged the song like the Blue Bonnets did, I bet a whole lot more would. Take a listen:</p>

<p>That’s a seriously good arrangement and performance–so much so that it I wish Bruce would give it a go in concert next time around.</p>
<p>If anyone has any other information about this band, I’d love to know.</p>
