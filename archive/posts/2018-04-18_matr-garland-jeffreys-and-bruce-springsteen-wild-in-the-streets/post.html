Garland’s first hit that year was “Wild in the Streets,” a gritty song about street crime.</p>
<p>Garland and Bruce have performed it together on four occasions, and one of those was Bruce’s holiday show in Asbury Park, December 7, 2003. (Yes, it’s a strange selection for a holiday show.)</p>
<p>Here’s that performance from Garland and Bruce, backed by the Max Weinberg 7.</p>

<p>Not bad, but IMO, it doesn’t hold a candle to the original:</p>
