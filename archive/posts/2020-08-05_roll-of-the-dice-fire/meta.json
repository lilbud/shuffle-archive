This is a song that comes alive when Bruce performs it live but is rather limp on vinyl.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Fire\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jEKquOrJiAI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Bruce&#8217;s studio version features a 2010 vocal grafted onto a 1977 backing track that sounds like it was intended to be more of a rehearsal than a finished take. It almost certainly was&#8211;here&#8217;s the original studio outtake, from June 17, 1977, in which you&#8217;ll notice that several of the lyrics are bluffed (meaning Bruce mumbles or sings nonsense syllables where the lyrics are unfinished).</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen Fire\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/__czrpiKRAM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Bruce could have edited and interwoven new vocals to replace the unfinished lines (as he did with other tracks on <em>The Promise</em>), but instead he chose to re-record the vocal track from scratch.</p>\n<p>That was a wise choice&#8211;despite his ability to mimic his earlier singing styles, there&#8217;s no mistaking Bruce&#8217;s 2010 voice for his 1977 one. (Compare the outtake above with the official version at the top of the article and hear for yourself.)\u00a0 &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/08/20/roll-of-the-dice-the-brokenhearted/\">The Brokenhearted,</a>&#8221; for example, would have been a stronger track had Bruce taken the full vocal replacement approach rather than a surgical one.</p>\n<p>In any event, the original track runs for more than five minutes, and even edited for release on\u00a0<em>The Promise</em>, the official version meanders for more than four minutes.</p>\n<p>Speaking of meandering, I almost forgot the second thing we should just acknowledge before we go any further:</p>\n<p>&#8220;Fire&#8221; is more than a little bit dated. And I use the term &#8220;dated&#8221; because it&#8217;s kinder than &#8220;date rapey.&#8221; File &#8220;Fire&#8221; under &#8220;songs no one would write today.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m a bit surprised, in fact, that Bruce chose to finish and release his incomplete 1977 studio outtake on his 2010 collection, <em>The Promise</em>, and even more surprised that it didn&#8217;t meet a similar reception as Robin Thicke&#8217;s &#8220;Blurred Lines&#8221; (which is essentially a modern &#8220;Fire&#8221; retelling) did three years later.</p>\n<p>A holdover from Bruce&#8217;s less enlightened &#8220;little girl&#8221; days (an oft-repeated phrase in his early songs that by 1982 prompted a letter-writing protest campaign by the National Organization of Women), &#8220;Fire&#8221; is at the very least a little uncomfortable to listen to with modern ears.</p>\n<p>Still, there&#8217;s no denying its crowd-pleasing Fire-power, thanks largely to its instantly recognizable bass\u00a0 line and the simmering sexual frustration that Bruce channels for his live performances of the song.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen &amp; The E Street Band - Fire (Live in Houston, 1978)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MVFJ2QUJhUE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>In fact, if not for Bruce&#8217;s live performances of it from the late 1970s through mid-1980s, fans likely would have considered &#8220;Fire&#8221; forgettable despite The Pointer Sisters&#8217; chart success with it.</p>\n<p>The story goes like this:</p>\n<p>In the summer of 1977, Bruce decided he&#8217;d write a song for Elvis&#8211;literally. I&#8217;ve always suspected that story is a bit apocryphal, but there&#8217;s no doubt that at the very least Bruce was writing with The King in mind&#8211;we can hear it in the outtake recording, even down to the Elvis-esque vocal frills in the bluffed lyrics.</p>\n<p>Whether by forethought or afterthought however, Bruce reportedly sent his demo to Elvis for consideration. We don&#8217;t know exactly when that would have been, but since we know the outtake above was recorded in mid-June of &#8217;77, it&#8217;s likely that if Elvis ever received it, it wasn&#8217;t before early July, at which point he had only weeks to live.</p>\n<p>With Elvis unable to record it and Bruce disinterested in including it on\u00a0<em>Darkness on the Edge of Town</em>, Bruce gave the song to <a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/01/31/cover-me-robert-gordon-and-link-wray-fire/\">Robert Gordon, who recorded it with Link Wray</a> and released it in 1978. Gordon&#8217;s cover got some airplay but never cracked the Top 100.</p>\n<p>The next year, however, The Pointer Sisters took a crack at it and took &#8220;Fire&#8221; all the way to #2.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Pointer Sisters - Fire\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/K9S5EZgIJck?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>All the while, Bruce made &#8220;Fire&#8221; a staple of his set lists&#8211;if he was reluctant to release it on vinyl, he had no hesitation about performing it live, and very quickly it became a fan favorite.</p>\n<p>Watching Bruce&#8217;s live performances, It&#8217;s easy to see why. It&#8217;s not because of the lyrics, which are few and cringe-inducing:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I&#8217;m driving in my car, I turn on the radio</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;m pulling you close, you just say no</em><br />\n<em>You say you don&#8217;t like it, but girl I know you&#8217;re a liar</em><br />\n<em>&#8216;Cause when we kiss, oh, fire</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well late at night, I&#8217;m taking you home</em><br />\n<em>I say I wanna stay, you say you wanna be alone</em><br />\n<em>You say you don&#8217;t love me, but you can&#8217;t hide your desire</em><br />\n<em>When we kiss, oh, fire</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>You had a hold on me right from the start</em><br />\n<em>A grip so tight I couldn&#8217;t tear it apart</em><br />\n<em>My nerves all jumping acting like a fool</em><br />\n<em>Your kisses they burn but your heart stays cool</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Romeo and Juliet, Samson and Delilah</em><br />\n<em>You can bet their love they couldn&#8217;t deny</em><br />\n<em>Your words say split, but your words they lie</em><br />\n<em>When we kiss, oh, fire, fire</em></p>\n<p>No, what makes Bruce&#8217;s live performances of &#8220;Fire&#8221; so great, so inspired, so head-and-shoulders above the studio version, is that he quickly realized the song&#8217;s secret ingredient&#8211;the essential element that didn&#8217;t make it into any of the studio recordings, including his own.</p>\n<p>The secret to Bruce&#8217;s live performances of &#8220;Fire&#8221; is&#8230;</p>\n<p>&#8230;</p>\n<p>&#8230;</p>\n<p>&#8230;</p>\n<p>&#8230;</p>\n<p>&#8230;</p>\n<p>&#8230;the pause.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Fire&#8221; is all about&#8230; the pause.\u00a0It&#8217;s about the tease.\u00a0It&#8217;s about satisfaction delayed and ultimately denied.</p>\n<p>In his Darkness Tour performances (see the clip above for an example), we can see and hear Bruce subtly arriving at that realization as his on-stage hamming evolved night by night. By the time he toured next, for <em>The River</em> in 1980, Bruce was milking the tease to comic and choreographed extremes, with his foil by his side.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Fire (The River Tour, Tempe 1980)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NtK-Jam_V68?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Nearly 30 years later, Bruce and Clarence were still serving up the same shtick.

At the very last show of the Devils &amp; Dust Tour, Bruce played &#8220;Fire&#8221; in an unusual arrangement&#8211;solo harmonica and bullet mic&#8211;normally reserved for more serious subject matter like &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/02/27/roll-of-the-dice-reason-to-believe/\">Reason to Believe</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/07/20/roll-of-the-dice-johnny-99/\">Johnny 99</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In this Nebraska-esque arrangement, &#8220;Fire&#8221; comes across more sinister than silly, and the result is more than a little chilling.</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02y1YU1_NGs</p>\n<p>&#8220;Fire&#8221; has been a rarity in Bruce&#8217;s set lists for the last three decades, and especially so since the passing of The Big Man, whose presence was so essential to Bruce&#8217;s earlier performances. In recent performances, Patti or Steve stand in for Clarence, but of course it&#8217;s never quite the same.</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1oagD7dv_Q</p>\n<p>Still, &#8220;Fire&#8221; remains a fan favorite for those able to look past its content, or at least recognize that we don&#8217;t have to admire a song&#8217;s point-of-view character to appreciate a great performance.</p>\n<p><strong>Fire<br />\nRecorded:</strong> 1977 and 2010<br />\n<strong>Released:</strong>\u00a0<em>The Promise\u00a0</em>(2010)<br />\n<strong>First performed:</strong> May 23, 1978 (Buffalo, NY)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> September 4, 2021 (New York City, NY)</p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
