<p>I’m digging Cosmic Spin at the moment. Their <em>Gilding Lillies</em> EP is well worth seeking out for their gorgeous harmonies, deep grooves, and fantastic cover arrangements of Fleetwood Mac, Neil Young, and other great artists.</p>
<p>If you’re a fan of early Everything But the Girl, you’ll love Cosmic Spin.</p>
<p>In fact, the duo’s latest single (released just a few days ago as of this writing) is <a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/09/19/cover-me-everything-but-the-girl-tougher-than-the-rest/">a Springsteen song that Everything But the Girl covered</a> on their <em>Acoustic </em>album back in 1992.</p>
<p>EBTG’s version used to be my favorite of the “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/08/08/roll-of-the-dice-tougher-than-the-rest/">Tougher Than the Rest</a>” covers, but I think it’s just been supplanted. Listen and enjoy.</p>
