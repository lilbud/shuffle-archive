<blockquote><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">“This song breaks my heart every time I hear it. It’s so beautifully written. I relate to the lyrics. Don’t we all have a secret garden?” — </span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">LeAnn Rimes, <em>The Press-Enterprise, </em>September 25, 2014</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Four years after she said those words to an interviewer, LeAnn Rimes showed us that Bruce’s beautiful “<a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/05/30/roll-of-the-dice-secret-garden/">Secret Garden</a>” still breaks her heart. When she performed it in studio for Sirius XM, she barely made it through the song. “I couldn’t hold back the tears,” she wrote on her Facebook page when she shared the video.</p>
<p>There’s nothing else that needs to be said about her sublime performance, except: she obviously truly understands the song’s lyrics and the sadness that’s the source of its beauty.</p>
