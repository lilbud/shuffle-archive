<p>Bruce covered “Down in the Valley” only once, at the Stone Pony with Southside Johnny and The Asbury Jukes, on October 13, 1977. The recording quality isn’t great, but it’s Bruce’s only known performance of the song. We’re fortunate to have a document of it.</p>
<p>If you pay close attention at the end, you’ll notice the boys get out of the song by lifting the ending of Bruce’s concert arrangement of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/11/19/roll-of-the-dice-tenth-avenue-freeze-out/">Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out</a>.”</p>
