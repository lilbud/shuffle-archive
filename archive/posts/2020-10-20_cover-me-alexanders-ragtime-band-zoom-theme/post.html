<p>Well, I knew this was coming sooner or later, so I might as well get it over with.  I should probably preface this with: <em>For Completists Only.</em></p>
<p>So here’s the deal:</p>
<p>There’s a song in Bruce’s catalog referred to by fans and bootleggers as “Zoom Theme.”  It’s considered a Springsteen original; it should therefore receive an entry under the <em>Roll of the Dice </em>banner.</p>
<p>The thing is: by no stretch is “Zoom Theme” an original Springsteen song. Reference texts and sites describe at as a re-written version of Irving Berlin’s “Alexander’s Ragtime Band,” but there’s very little re-written about it.</p>
<p>Here’s the original, first recorded by Arthur Collins and Byron Harlan in 1911.</p>

<p>That recording was an instant smash success. For ten solid weeks, it was the most popular song in the United States, and it kicked off an entire ragtime craze.</p>
<p>It inspired covers for decades, a dozen of which became hits over the fifty years following its initial release. So while today it may only echo faintly in the recesses of American musical history, for 21-year-old Bruce Springsteen in 1971, “Alexander’s Ragtime Band” loomed large.</p>
<p>As to what inspired him to adopt it as his (very) short-lived band’s theme song, that I cannot say.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, when Bruce adopted his Dr. Zoom  persona in the spring of 1971 and assembled a band he called The Sonic Boom, he adapted the song as a mid-set transition. You can listen to this very rare recording below, but don’t say I didn’t warn you.</p>
<p>The recording quality is just fine, mind you, but the performance–well, let’s just say Dr. Zoom and the Sonic Boom were known for embracing the absurd.</p>

<p>See what I mean? The only thing re-written about it is the song’s title refrain, and the performance… well, it’s not completely without merit, I suppose: “Funky” Garry Tallent gets a rare moment in the spotlight on this tuba-led arrangement.</p>
<p>Other than that, though… well, let’s just agree to treat this as a cover rather than an original. It seems the kindest thing to do.</p>
