Reference texts and sites describe at as a re-written version of Irving Berlin&#8217;s &#8220;Alexander&#8217;s Ragtime Band,&#8221; but there&#8217;s very little re-written about it.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the original, first recorded by Arthur Collins and Byron Harlan in 1911.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"1911 Collins and Harlan - Alexander\u2019s Ragtime Band\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/x9VGvaDRxNQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>That recording was an instant smash success. For ten solid weeks, it was the most popular song in the United States, and it kicked off an entire ragtime craze.</p>\n<p>It inspired covers for decades, a dozen of which became hits over the fifty years following its initial release. So while today it may only echo faintly in the recesses of American musical history, for 21-year-old Bruce Springsteen in 1971, &#8220;Alexander&#8217;s Ragtime Band&#8221; loomed large.</p>\n<p>As to what inspired him to adopt it as his (very) short-lived band&#8217;s theme song, that I cannot say.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, when Bruce adopted his Dr. Zoom\u00a0 persona in the spring of 1971 and assembled a band he called The Sonic Boom, he adapted the song as a mid-set transition. You can listen to this very rare recording below, but don&#8217;t say I didn&#8217;t warn you.</p>\n<p>The recording quality is just fine, mind you, but the performance&#8211;well, let&#8217;s just say Dr. Zoom and the Sonic Boom were known for embracing the absurd.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"zoom theme (  a rewrite of Irving Berlin&#039;s &quot;Alexander&#039;s Ragtime Band&quot;.)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lFLAhgH-E1A?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>See what I mean? The only thing re-written about it is the song&#8217;s title refrain, and the performance&#8230; well, it&#8217;s not completely without merit, I suppose: &#8220;Funky&#8221; Garry Tallent gets a rare moment in the spotlight on this tuba-led arrangement.</p>\n<p>Other than that, though&#8230; well, let&#8217;s just agree to treat this as a cover rather than an original.
