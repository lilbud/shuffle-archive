Ken Tizzard is a Newfoundland-based singer-songwriter and bassist for The Watchmen.

When radio station 97.5 KROCK aired a Springsteen special featuring tributes from local artists, Tizzard contributed a song that meant a lot to him.

"[Devils & Dust](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/03/02/roll-of-the-dice-devils-dust/)" captured Tizzard's imagination not because he could identify with it, but because he *couldn't*–until he heard Bruce sing it.

"I have never been to war," he wrote on [his web site](https://kentizzard.com/blogs/ms-updates/posts/devils-and-dust-springsteen-i-could-never-imagine). "I have never had to make the choices that people have had to make in war. I have never killed another person, or watch my friends be killed in battle. I cannot understand the fear, sadness, and the emotional weight of such an event. Sometimes a songwriter, through their own experience or through something they've gleaned from a trusted first hand source, will tap into one of these unimaginable events. Through their words I can catch a glimpse of something I would never truly understand."

Tizzard's cover is a deeply empathic one and a great example of how music helps us understand a world much bigger than our own place in it.
