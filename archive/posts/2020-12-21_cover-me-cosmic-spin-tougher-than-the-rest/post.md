I’m digging Cosmic Spin at the moment. Their EP is well worth seeking out for their gorgeous harmonies, deep grooves, and fantastic cover arrangements of Fleetwood Mac, Neil Young, and other great artists.

If you’re a fan of early Everything But the Girl, you’ll love Cosmic Spin.

In fact, the duo’s latest single (released just a few days ago as of this writing) is on their album back in 1992.

EBTG’s version used to be my favorite of the “” covers, but I think it’s just been supplanted. Listen and enjoy.
