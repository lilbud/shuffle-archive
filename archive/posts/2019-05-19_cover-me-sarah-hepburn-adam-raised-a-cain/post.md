Gotta confess: I know next to nothing about Sarah Hepburn, and absolutely zero about Mungo Records and the film called *W at Mungo Park*.

But that film’s soundtrack apparently includes this wonderful, brooding cover of Bruce’s “[Adam Raised a Cain](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/07/03/roll-of-the-dice-adam-raised-a-cain/).”

I only came across this one recently, it’s been on heavy rotation ever since. Turn off the lights, turn up the volume, and listen.
