<p>But that film’s soundtrack apparently includes this wonderful, brooding cover of Bruce’s “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/07/03/roll-of-the-dice-adam-raised-a-cain/">Adam Raised a Cain</a>.”</p>
<p>I only came across this one recently, it’s been on heavy rotation ever since. Turn off the lights, turn up the volume, and listen.</p>
