**2000:** Bruce launches a tradition that will continue for several years to come, calling on friends to help throw a big holiday concert at Asbury Park’s Convention Hall to benefit local charities. On hand are the Max Weinberg 7, Danny, Garry, Roy, Patti (who debuts new music), Soozie, Steve, Nils, Clarence, Southside, Lisa Lowell, and Bobby Bandiera. In the encores, Bruce debuts a brand new song, “My City of Ruins,” written for and dedicated to Asbury Park. Before a year is up, however, the song will grow and take on new meaning and resonance to a wider audience.
