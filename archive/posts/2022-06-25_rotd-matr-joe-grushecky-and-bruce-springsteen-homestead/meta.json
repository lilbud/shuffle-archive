They&#8217;d recorded &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/04/03/meeting-across-the-river-joe-grushecky-and-bruce-springsteen-never-be-enough-time/\">Never Be Enough Time</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/05/25/matr-joe-grushecky-and-bruce-springsteen-chain-smokin/\">Chain Smokin&#8217;,</a>&#8221; but Joe wasn&#8217;t satisfied with his other material and neither was Bruce.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know, you gotta write some better songs,&#8221; Joe recalls Bruce saying. &#8220;You write so much better than this. These aren\u2019t up to any kind of standard.'&#8221;</p>\n<p>Joe took the feedback to heart and cleared the bar on his next attempt. &#8220;As fate would have it, I came home and we played a gig somewhere, and one of my old-time fans came up, and he handed me a book called <em>Homestead</em>.&#8221;</p>\n<p><em>Homestead</em> is about a Carnegie steel town by the same name near Pittsburgh, with a mill that made its owners rich and gave thousands of bread-earners a chance to make a decent living for more than a century&#8211;a century bookended by a famous labor union stand-off and by the closure of the mill when it became cheaper to make steel elsewhere.</p>\n<p>By the early 1980s, the mill was dying, and with his band the Iron City Houserockers, Joe helped start America&#8217;s first food bank for the unemployed steelworkers. &#8220;Dan Rather did a story on us on CBS News,&#8221; Joe recalled. &#8220;And through the years, I had become friends with the people who we helped out. So I was familiar with some of the guys, this guy Ron Wyden and Jay Weinberg and Mike Stout. They were the real\u2013almost radical\u2013end of the steel workers, the real pro-union guys when the whole thing was collapsing. I read the book, and I think it mentioned Bruce. I\u2019m sure it mentioned Bruce, because he became involved. It also mentioned us, it\u2019s something we have in common.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The inspiration came from the book; the lyrics came to Joe on his morning commute. &#8220;I live in the South Hills of Pittsburgh, and every day when I\u2019d go to work, I go through a tunnel. I had to cross the river in a tunnel, and I can remember coming out of this tunnel, and this song just came to me about Homestead. So I started writing it down, and in the meantime we were going to go to New York to finish those first two songs [with Bruce].</p>\n<p>&#8220;So I wrote these lyrics, but I just didn\u2019t have any good music for him. I tried to come up with stuff, and it just wasn\u2019t happening. So we finished recording &#8216;Chain Smokin\u2019 and &#8216;Never Be Enough Time,&#8217; and \u00a0I thought, at least this is going to get me started again. Right at the end of our session, I pulled out the paper I had in my notebook and I said, &#8216;Hey, you know, if you feel like it\u2026 if you get the urge, here\u2019s some lyrics. I think the lyrics are really good, but I don\u2019t have any good music for it.&#8217;</p>\n<p>&#8220;So the following weekend comes, and it\u2019s Sunday night, and my wife comes and hands me the phone and says it\u2019s Bruce. Bruce goes and starts playing &#8216;Homestead&#8217; on the phone. And I said, &#8216;Oh man, that\u2019s <em>great</em>!&#8217; He said &#8216;we got to record this!&#8217; I said, &#8216;Oh, that\u2019s fabulous! When?&#8217; He says, &#8216;Tuesday.'&#8221;</p>\n<p>Now Joe has always been a teacher, and it&#8217;s not easy for teachers to take time off during the school year. But when Bruce Springsteen co-writes a song with you and wants to record it, one does what one must. Even if it means being a little sneaky.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I was real honest with my supervisor,&#8221; Joe explained, &#8220;and I was telling her, &#8216;Well, I have a chance to go to Los Angeles to record with Bruce Springsteen, and then I have a chance to go to New York.&#8217; I have a good work ethic. I showed up every day, I did my job, rarely missed. Anyway, so she calls me in the office, this is right before the weekend I go back, and she says this is not coming from me, but the head honcho\u2026 he says, &#8216;If you go to work with Bruce Springsteen again, we\u2019re firing you.&#8217; For some reason, he had it in for Bruce Springsteen. He did\u00a0<em>not</em> like Bruce Springsteen, and he didn\u2019t want me to work with Bruce Springsteen. For whatever reason, I never found out.</p>\n<p>&#8220;So now I go into work on Monday. Monday night, I call in sick. Now I\u2019m being a little bit sneaky instead of being honest, because who\u2019s going to pass up the chance to do that? Lee Ann and I flew up to New York, and somebody picked us up and took us to Bruce\u2019s in Jersey.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The next day we get up, and we\u2019re working on a song in Bruce\u2019s study. I had my mom and dad at home watching my kids, and in the midst of working on this song\u2026 I was a bit nervous, to tell you the truth, because Bruce was using Drop D tuning, and I was not familiar with it at that time. I couldn\u2019t figure out what the hell he was playing! I should have just asked him, but I guess\u2026I don\u2019t know, I was almost overwhelmed because Bruce Springsteen is recording one of my songs that we\u2019re writing together!</p>\n<p>&#8220;So we\u2019re going over the music that he wrote for this, and Patti comes into his study and she has the phone. (This is pre-cell phone days.) And it\u2019s my mom. Patti said, &#8216;Your mom wants you to call. She just called and left a message.&#8217; So right away, you think the worst\u2013you think that somethings wrong with the kids, blah blah blah, something\u2019s terribly wrong.</p>\n<p>&#8220;So I called, and she said &#8216;Joey,&#8217; (she always called me Joey) &#8216;Joey, you gotta call work right away.&#8217; And I said, &#8216;What\u2019s wrong?&#8217; And my mom said, &#8216;If you don\u2019t call them in fifteen minutes they\u2019re firing you.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Get out!&#8217;</p>\n<p>&#8220;So I called, and [the head honcho] got on the phone and he says, &#8216;Where are you?&#8217; And I said, &#8216;Well, you know, I\u2019m sick.&#8217; He says, &#8216;So why didn\u2019t you answer the phone?&#8217; I said, &#8216;Well I was in the bathroom! I\u2019m sick.&#8217; He said, &#8216;You\u2019re not with Bruce Springsteen are you?&#8217; And Bruce is two feet away. I said, &#8216;No, I\u2019m not at Bruce Springsteen\u2019s. I\u2019m home in Pittsburgh.&#8217; And then he made me come in with a doctor\u2019s excuse, so I had to go to my buddy who was a doctor and tell him the whole story and get a doctor\u2019s excuse.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It was worth the hassle. &#8220;Homestead&#8221; ended up as one of the strongest tracks on <em>American Babylon.</em> It&#8217;s such a good song, in fact, that Bruce recorded his own version, which remains unreleased to this day.</p>\n<audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-33514-8\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/16-Homestead.mp3?_=8\" /><a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/16-Homestead.mp3\">https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/16-Homestead.mp3</a></audio>\n<p>Bruce may have decided not to release his own version of &#8220;Homestead,&#8221; but Joe&#8217;s lyrics certainly seemed to have made an impression on him&#8211;because shortly after putting the finishing touches on\u00a0<em>American Babylon\u00a0</em>with Joe, Bruce recorded a song called &#8220;Youngstown&#8221; and released it on\u00a0<em>The Ghost of Tom Joad</em> only a few weeks on the heels of Joe&#8217;s album.</p>\n<p>Youngstown, Ohio is only a ninety-minute drive from Homestead, Pennsylvania, and the two songs bear some remarkable thematic and lyrical similarities. Compare Joe&#8217;s first verse&#8230;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I was born in the corn fields of Kentucky</em><br />\n<em>I moved north in &#8217;73</em><br />\n<em>The war was still going strong so I found a job</em><br />\n<em>Rolling steel in a foundry in Homestead</em></p>\n<p>&#8230;with Bruce&#8217;s:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Here in northeast Ohio, back in eighteen-o-three</em><br />\n<em>James and Danny Heaton found the ore that was lining Yellow Creek</em><br />\n<em>They built a blast furnace here along the shore</em><br />\n<em>And they made the cannon balls that helped the Union win the war</em></p>\n<p>Or this verse of Joe&#8217;s:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>And the steel glowed in the white hot chambers</em><br />\n<em>The furnace spit fire and smoke</em><br />\n<em>And the sunlight came through the cracks in the roof</em><br />\n<em>And the dust was so thick you could choke</em></p>\n<p>&#8230;with Bruce&#8217;s &#8220;Youngstown&#8221; verse:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well my daddy worked the furnaces, kept &#8217;em hotter than hell</em><br />\n<em>I come home from &#8216;Nam worked my way to scarfer, a job that&#8217;d suit the devil as well</em><br />\n<em>Well taconite coke and limestone fed my children and made my pay</em><br />\n<em>Them smokestacks reaching like the arms of God into a beautiful sky of soot and clay</em></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not hard to see Joe&#8217;s influence on Bruce&#8217;s songwriting.</p>\n<p>Joe&#8217;s lyrics were definitively Pittsburgh, however. I&#8217;d always been struck by the name Joe chose for his single named character in &#8220;Homestead,&#8221; and I asked him about it when we spoke, because Grzybowski is\u00a0<em>not\u00a0</em>an easy name to sing. I did a little sleuthing and found a newspaper reference to a co-worker of Joe&#8217;s by that name, and Joe confirmed the easter egg. <b>&#8220;</b>His dad worked in Homestead. I just picked his name out of a hat. I could have picked a lot of other ones. I just liked the way it sounded and it was so Pittsburgh: Grzybowski.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Joe and Bruce have performed &#8220;Homestead&#8221; together nineteen times over the years since its debut, including every night of Joe&#8217;s legendary October Assault mini-tour following the release of the album in 1995.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Homestead - Bruce Springsteen &amp; Joe Grushecky The Houserockers (20-10-1995 Nick&#039;s Fat City)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/u7jDtLFtVnU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>It&#8217;s been more than a decade since we&#8217;ve last seen them perform it together on stage, but it&#8217;s difficult to believe we won&#8217;t see them do it again.
