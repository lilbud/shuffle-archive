Turn it up!

If you’re only familiar with Southside Johnny’s cover and haven’t heard Bruce’s original version before, turn your stereo way up loud and prepare for a revelation, because this is a *very* different take:

Bruce wrote “When You Dance” with Steve Van Zandt in 1971 and played it with The Bruce Springsteen Band throughout late 1971 and early 1972.

The version above is from a 1972 rehearsal session recorded at Challenger Eastern Surfboards. The stereo sound quality is amazing, and IMO this is an early gem that belongs in every Springsteen fan’s collection.

Southside Johnny covered “When You Dance” on *This Time It’s For Real* in 1977, but even though the melody, riff, and hook are recognizable, the lyrics are very different.

SSJ’s version is credited to both Bruce and Steve Van Zandt as songwriters, but it’s not clear if that was always the case or if Bruce gave his version to Steve to adapt. Regardless, both versions deserve to be played *loud*.

And while the two versions are very different lyrically, they’re also essentially the same: both feature a narrator completely mesmerized by a girl on the dance floor, lost in a reverie and imagining, yearning for, let’s say, a private dance.

Bruce’s version:

*When you dance, ah come on mama hold me tight*  
*Make romance, yeah kiss me baby in the night*  
*When you move, oh don’t you know I love you so*  
*When you groove, meet baby I’m on the lights down low*

*When you love, you know I’ll chase the heavens above*  
*From above, and my body shaking for you love*  
*You’re so wild that I want you for my partner child*  
*When you smile, how you move just right*

Southside’s version:

*When you dance, I hear the music rocking everywhere*  
*When you dance, I see the light shining through your hair*  
*When you dance, baby, the band is blowing like a hurricane*  
*When you dance, you look so fine but you don’t know my name*

*When you dance, your smile hiding what you’re thinking of*  
*When you dance, your body tremble like you’re making love*  
*When you move, baby, my soul is aching and my blood run hot*  
*Run into me now, my heart is breaking shaking what you’ve got*

Southside’s version has more polished lyrics and a brassier arrangement, but for my ears, Bruce’s guitar jam takes the prize.

There are a few Bruce Springsteen Band performances of “When You Dance” circulating, but if you want to hear Bruce play it with the E Street Band, you’ll have to turn to the [Asbury Park All-Star Revue shows from 1977](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/05/12/kingdom-of-days-may-12/), where Bruce, Steve, the E Street Band, and the Jukes all teamed up to cover for an ailing Southside Johnny. These shows feature the only known performances of “When You Dance” in the E Street Band era.
