Regardless, both versions deserve to be played\u00a0<em>loud</em>.</p>\n<p>And while the two versions are very different lyrically, they&#8217;re also essentially the same: both feature a narrator completely mesmerized by a girl on the dance floor, lost in a reverie and imagining, yearning for, let&#8217;s say, a private dance.</p>\n<p>Bruce&#8217;s version:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>When you dance, ah come on mama hold me tight</em><br />\n<em>Make romance, yeah kiss me baby in the night</em><br />\n<em>When you move, oh don&#8217;t you know I love you so</em><br />\n<em>When you groove, meet baby I&#8217;m on the lights down low</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>When you love, you know I&#8217;ll chase the heavens above</em><br />\n<em>From above, and my body shaking for you love</em><br />\n<em>You&#8217;re so wild that I want you for my partner child</em><br />\n<em>When you smile, how you move just right</em></p>\n<p>Southside&#8217;s version:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>When you dance, I hear the music rocking everywhere</em><br />\n<em>When you dance, I see the light shining through your hair</em><br />\n<em>When you dance, baby, the band is blowing like a hurricane</em><br />\n<em>When you dance, you look so fine but you don&#8217;t know my name</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>When you dance, your smile hiding what you&#8217;re thinking of</em><br />\n<em>When you dance, your body tremble like you&#8217;re making love</em><br />\n<em>When you move, baby, my soul is aching and my blood run hot</em><br />\n<em>Run into me now, my heart is breaking shaking what you&#8217;ve got</em></p>\n<p>Southside&#8217;s version has more polished lyrics and a brassier arrangement, but for my ears, Bruce&#8217;s guitar jam takes the prize.</p>\n<p>There are a few Bruce Springsteen Band performances of &#8220;When You Dance&#8221; circulating, but if you want to hear Bruce play it with the E Street Band, you&#8217;ll have to turn to the <a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/05/12/kingdom-of-days-may-12/\">Asbury Park All-Star Revue shows from 1977</a>, where Bruce, Steve, the E Street Band, and the Jukes all teamed up to cover for an ailing Southside Johnny.
