Maybe it was the relative lack of companionship on a solo tour that prompted Bruce to make unannounced visits to the arena parking lots during breaks in the sound checks. (His son Evan accompanied him for this leg of the tour, but Bruce liked to remark that Evan was usually lost in his videogames.) Whatever the reason, it was a never-before opportunity to meet the arti<span class=\"text_exposed_show\">st in person and maybe even make make a request.</span></p>\n<div class=\"text_exposed_show\">\n<p>My friend Kris and I were lucky enough to meet Bruce outside of the Rose Garden before the Portland show, and Kris requested her favorite song, &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/04/06/roll-of-the-dice-janey-dont-you-lose-heart/\">Janey, Don&#8217;t You Lose Heart</a>.&#8221; She got her request&#8230; two shows later.
