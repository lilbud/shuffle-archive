BOOM a LOON bills themselves as “the next step in funk,” releasing a new song weekly, featuring a core combo and a rotating cast of guest artists.

Last month, they released a stellar cover of “[Dancing in the Dark](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/12/25/roll-of-the-dice-dancing-in-the-dark/)” that you should definitely give a listen.

Yeah, I know–*everyone* covers “Dancing in the Dark” these days, and I therefore do my best to ensure that the ones I feature here on the Shuffle bring something fresh or fun to the table.

These guys do both.

Featuring guest artists Robert J. Hunter on vocals and Eddy Smith on keys, BOOM a LOON reinvents Bruce’s greatest hit and gives it an irresistible groove.
