<p>BOOM a LOON bills themselves as “the next step in funk,” releasing a new song weekly, featuring a core combo and a rotating cast of guest artists.</p>
<p>Last month, they released a stellar cover of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/12/25/roll-of-the-dice-dancing-in-the-dark/">Dancing in the Dark</a>” that you should definitely give a listen.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know–<em>everyone</em> covers “Dancing in the Dark” these days, and I therefore do my best to ensure that the ones I feature here on the Shuffle bring something fresh or fun to the table.</p>
<p>These guys do both.</p>
<p>Featuring guest artists Robert J. Hunter on vocals and Eddy Smith on keys, BOOM a LOON reinvents Bruce’s greatest hit and gives it an irresistible groove.</p>
