I’m not a big Bon Jovi fan, but I do love their song, “Who Says You Can’t Go Home,” from their 2005 album. That’s probably because it sounds just like a Bruce Springsteen song.

*Have a Nice Day*

Seriously, just listen to the lyrics and tell me that Jon wasn’t channeling Bruce when he wrote it:

So I was pretty psyched when Jon asked Bruce to join him when he played “Who Says You Can’t Go Home” at the benefit concert for the victims of Hurricane Sandy.

Sure enough, the song fit Bruce like a glove. Watch and see–it’s a fantastic performance:

As it turns out, “Who Says You Can’t Go Home” was made for a duet. In fact, Jon Bon Jovi recorded and filmed versions of it for the same album. You’ve seen the first at the top of this post; here’s the second, in a country arrangement with Jennifer Nettles:

I gotta say: Bruce turned in a great performance, but the best “Who Says You Can’t Go Home” duet award has to go to Jon and Jennifer.
