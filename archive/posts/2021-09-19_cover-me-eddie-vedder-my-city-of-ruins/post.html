<p>Bruce Springsteen didn’t make a surprise appearance at <em>Sea.Hear.Now</em> last night, but his music sure did.</p>
<p>At Pearl Jam’s first concert in more than three years, Eddie Vedder kicked off the encore set with  a cover of “My City of Ruins” in a solo acoustic arrangement, accompanied by four local singers: Jason  Rogers, Alexander Simone, Joshua Rivers, and Michelle Rushing. (I am almost certain to have misspelled or misheard at least one of their last names, so I apologize in advance.)</p>
<p>Now this wasn’t the first time Vedder has covered “My City of Ruins” in concert. He gave a notable performance of it in 2009 at the Kennedy Center Honors for Bruce.</p>

<p>He performed it a couple of years later at a benefit for Haiti, too.</p>

<p>But longtime Springsteen fans (or at least pre-Rising ones) know that “My City of Ruins” has special meaning when performed in Asbury Park, because it’s the city Bruce sings about in the song. Bruce wrote it before Asbury had reinvented and rejuvenated itself, and when performed today by the sea and before a sea of humanity, “My City of Ruins” isn’t a dirge–it’s a celebration.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy this video of the full performance–I filmed it myself, and I think it came out rather nicely.</p>

<p>Bonus: Earlier in the show, Eddie also weighed in on Bruce’s legal troubles from earlier this year, and he made some pretty salient points. Smart guy, that Mr. Vedder.</p>
