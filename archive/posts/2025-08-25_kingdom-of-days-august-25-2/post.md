**1979:** Bruce and the band record “[Point Blank](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/12/19/roll-of-the-dice-point-blank/)” and an early arrangement of “[You Can Look (Buy You Better Not Touch)](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/06/14/roll-of-the-dice-you-can-look-but-you-better-not-touch/)” during a recording session at the Power Station in New York City.

**1984:** Bruce and the E Street Band kick off a four-night stand at the Capital Center in Largo, Maryland. In attendance tonight: conservative political columnist George Will, who is moved enough by the show to write [a column about Bruce](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1984/09/13/bruce-springsteens-usa/f6502baa-a8eb-48ad-ba85-7fa848d8833e/) for publication the following month.

**1992:** World Tour 1992 moves on to the Washington DC area, with the first of two shows at the Capital Center in Largo.

It will surface once more next year, and then not again until the Reunion Tour.

**2009:** Jay Weinberg flies solo on drums for the entire Working on a Dream show in Saratoga Springs, but it’s the soundcheck that’s most interesting about this show: check out a rare “[Spare Parts](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/01/08/roll-of-the-dice-spare-parts/)” and Little Steven on lead vocals for “[Prove It All Night](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/10/24/roll-of-the-dice-prove-it-all-night/)” and “[Hungry Heart](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/12/21/roll-of-the-dice-hungry-heart/).”

**2016:** Bruce flirts with the four-hour mark at Night Two at MetLife Stadium, stopping just short of it but setting a new American record for show length just the same. “New York City Serenade” with strings is once again the opener, and “[Jersey Girl](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/07/24/cover-me-roll-of-the-dice-jersey-girl/)” with fireworks is once again the closer (this time with a marriage proposal that ends the evening on a wonderfully loose and romantic note). Tom Morello makes his final E Street Band appearance to date, on stage for four songs. For more highlights from this show, see my [*Where the Band Was*](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/08/25/where-the-band-was-east-rutherford-august-25-2016/) report.

**2018:** *Springsteen on Broadway* continues its theatrical run at the Walter Kerr Theater in New York City. Patti is absent tonight, so fans in attendance get the show’s “B” set with the “This Hard Land” encore. In the audience tonight: Argentine tennis player Juan Martin del Potro.
