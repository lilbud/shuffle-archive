<p>We’re almost finished working our way through Bruce Springsteen’s “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/?s=1968+notebook">1968 Notebook</a>,” a remarkably early collection of material written (but not recorded) by a budding eighteen-year-old singer-songwriter destined for rock and roll stardom.</p>
<p>The notebook contains twenty unreleased songs. We know of its existence only because it was sold in a 2006 public auction with scans made available for potential bidders.</p>

<p>Our subject today is the faded entry at the very bottom of the table of contents above: an almost-finished song called “Sun Time,” complete with chord notation and direction.</p>

<p>Bruce’s lyrics are just a little bit fuzzy in the scan–enough to obfuscate several words throughout (particularly in the third verse). However, enough is legible for us to get a sense of “Sun Time” as a tender bordering on sappy love song that was no doubt intended for Bruce’s acoustic performances.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Like a forest after the rain</em><br/>
<em>As teardrops of sunlight pushes the ???</em><br/>
<em>Open like the sea after the storm ???</em><br/>
<em>And tranquility once again starts to reign</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Like a story that was never told</em><br/>
<em>Like a mountain stream with waters running so cold</em><br/>
<em>Like a flower wet with the spring</em><br/>
<em>Like the silly songs that I sing</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>The earth with all its beauty came to bare</em><br/>
<em>??? ??? through the silk thin strands of your honeyed hair</em><br/>
<em>and I feel ??? ??? knowing that your ???</em><br/>
<em>The thought that you may go away</em><br/>
<em>Clouds my tender years with ???</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>‘Cause I can’t see without your eyes</em><br/>
<em>And I can’t touch without your hands</em><br/>
<em>And I can’t live without your life</em><br/>
<em>And I can’t love without your love</em></p>
<p>There’s not a lot to analyze here, due both to the illegible lines and the relatively straightforward nature metaphor as stand-in for his love interest. Again, though, the kid was just eighteen and only beginning to experiment with writing about love. Bigger and better songs lay ahead.</p>
