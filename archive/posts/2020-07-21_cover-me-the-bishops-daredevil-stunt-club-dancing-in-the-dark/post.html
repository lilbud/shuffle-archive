<p>Well into their second decade, The Bishop’s Daredevil Stunt Club has carved out their berth at the forefront of the Chicago power pop scene with fierce guitar hooks, sweet harmonies, and a sound that’s more than a little reminiscent of The Cars.</p>
<p>Like many bands during the great pandemic of 2020, the boys stayed connected with each other and their fans via socially distant home studio sessions. At one of their sessions, they cut one of their favorite covers, “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/12/25/roll-of-the-dice-dancing-in-the-dark/">Dancing in the Dark</a>,” and nailed it in a single take.</p>
<p>Their version is even harder-driving than Bruce’s live arrangement. Fierce and fresh, they breathe new life and vital energy into Bruce’s highest-charting hit.</p>
<p>Turn the volume up <em>loud</em> and listen.</p>
