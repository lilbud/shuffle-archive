<p>When Warren Zevon was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, he wrote and recorded a final album, <em>The Wind,</em> replete with themes of finality and metaphors of mortality.  The album was released just two weeks before Zevon’s death.</p>
<p>Zevon tapped some friends to help him complete his final work, Bruce among them.</p>
<p>Bruce appears on two songs on the album, including “Prison Grove,” a prison blues song in which the jail serves as a very thinly-veiled metaphor for Zevon’s dying body.</p>
<p>Bruce supplies very recognizable backing vocals on this haunting track.</p>
