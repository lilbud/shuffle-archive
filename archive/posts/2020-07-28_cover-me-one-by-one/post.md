"One by One" by The Blues Magoos has a curious history–although never a big hit (the single peaked only at #71 when it was released in 1967), it's still one of the band's better-known songs, as well as their last one ever to chart.

The Blues Magoos recorded two versions of the song–the first one a Byrds-ish arrangement on their *Psychedelic Lollipop* album in 1966...

...and a second poppier arrangement that the band recorded to release as a single in 1967.

It's unclear which version Bruce Springsteen and The Castiles had in mind when they covered "One By One" in the autumn of 1967, because the recording of that one-time-only (that we know of) performance is distant and muddy.

But we at least have a pretty good idea why they chose to cover it at all: Bruce and the band had just seen The Blues Magoos perform it live in concert at Asbury Park's Convention Hall just a few weeks earlier.
