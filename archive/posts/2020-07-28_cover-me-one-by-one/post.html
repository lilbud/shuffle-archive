<p>“One by One” by The Blues Magoos has a curious history–although never a big hit (the single peaked only at #71 when it was released in 1967), it’s still one of the band’s better-known songs, as well as their last one ever to chart.</p>
<p>The Blues Magoos recorded two versions of the song–the first one a Byrds-ish arrangement on their <em>Psychedelic Lollipop </em>album in 1966…</p>

<p>…and a second poppier arrangement that the band recorded to release as a single in 1967.</p>

<p>It’s unclear which version Bruce Springsteen and The Castiles had in mind when they covered “One By One” in the autumn of 1967, because the recording of that one-time-only (that we know of) performance is distant and muddy.</p>

<p>But we at least have a pretty good idea why they chose to cover it at all: Bruce and the band had just seen The Blues Magoos perform it live in concert at Asbury Park’s Convention Hall just a few weeks earlier.</p>
