<p>Prepare yourself for the absolute best freaking cover of “Born to Run” ever.</p>
<p>Nashville rockers Diarrhea Planet are no strangers to Bruce’s signature song–they’d covered it in concert years before their mic drop performance as the closers for Nashville’s Freakin’ Weekend in 2017.</p>
<p>But add Music Band’s Harry Kagan on lead vocals, and the incredible Ross Holmes from Mumford &amp; Sons on fiddle (he darn near steals the show with his incredible solo), and the band’s already incredible cover takes off into the stratosphere.</p>
<p>Seriously: turn up the volume, switch to full screen mode, and just take it all in:</p>

<p>See what I mean? Sadly, Diarrhea Planet is no more–the band broke up in 2018. But at least we have this incredible performance to remember them by.</p>
<p>Just be careful not to mentally juxtapose the name of the band and the song, though, or else you may never hear “Born to Run” the same way again.</p>
