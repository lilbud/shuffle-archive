<p>It may have taken him two attempts to get started, but dang–Roger Daltrey absolutely <em>nails</em> his “Born to Run” cover.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNyut-S5fWs">Watch on Youtube: Roger Daltrey covers Born to Run by Bruce Springsteen</a></p>
<p>I’m not sure exactly when and where this performance happened (if you do, please drop me a line), but you can find it on Daltrey’s <em>Moonlighting</em> and <em>Gold</em> CDs.</p>
