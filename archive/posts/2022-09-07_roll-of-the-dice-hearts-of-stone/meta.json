Upon deeming it unsuitable for the album that was taking shape, Bruce donated the track to his friend Southside Johnny Lyon.</p>\n<p>Not the song, mind you, but <em>the entire studio track</em>.</p>\n<p>The version of &#8220;Hearts of Stone&#8221; that is widely considered to be one of the finest tracks ever recorded by Southside Johnny and The Asbury Jukes is in reality a performance by Southside Johnny and the E Street Band.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Hearts of Stone (2013 Remaster)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6Cqo8LOPDE0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Steven Van Zandt produced that track, subtly layering The Miami Horns beneath the band, and swapping out Bruce&#8217;s lead vocal for Southside&#8217;s.</p>\n<p>And oh, what a vocal! I&#8217;m nothing approaching a Southside scholar, but if there&#8217;s a more tender, emotional, heartbreaking vocal performance by Lyon anywhere on record, I haven&#8217;t heard it.</p>\n<p>Lyon&#8217;s performance (released as the title track to his seminal 1978 album) was so outstanding that there was really no point in releasing Springsteen&#8217;s own version&#8211;at least not until Bruce curated the collection of outtakes that would comprise his 1998 box set, <em>Tracks</em>.</p>\n<p>Like Southside and Stevie twenty years earlier, Bruce added a modern horn section to his original recording, with Ed Manion and Richie &#8220;La Bamba&#8221; Rosenberg having the distinction of performing on both the 1978 and 1998 tracks. The horns are more pronounced in the later version&#8211;particularly underneath Clarence&#8217;s saxophone solo&#8211;but we can still easily discern the identical underlying band recording.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Hearts Of Stone (Studio Outtake - 1977)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jnsi57O3V1o?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>For years, fans have debated over which version is the superior one, and it inevitably comes down to a comparison of the lead vocals. Bruce&#8217;s haunted, impassioned version stands up well next to Southside&#8217;s. So similar are their versions, in fact, that one could mix the two seamlessly to create a faux duet&#8211;as one enterprising fan unofficially did. Take a listen below.</p>\n<audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-32951-4\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/01-Hearts-of-Stone.mp3?_=4\" /><a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/01-Hearts-of-Stone.mp3\">https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/01-Hearts-of-Stone.mp3</a></audio>\n<p>So which version should we think of as the true original &#8220;Hearts of Stone?&#8221; Take your pick. They&#8217;re both built on the same original E Street Band performance, and they both have additional elements.</p>\n<p>But DNA typing isn&#8217;t the only challenge we&#8217;re presented with when analyzing &#8220;Hearts of Stone,&#8221; because lyrically we&#8217;re listening to one of the coldest, most emotionally brutal songs in Springsteen&#8217;s catalog. You wouldn&#8217;t realize it from listening to the painfully exquisite end result though, because both Bruce and Southside deliver their vocals with soulful tenderness and empathy that belie the song&#8217;s actual content.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Hearts of Stone&#8221; is an affair song. Or rather, a post-affair song, sung by the one who returns to his partner, to the paramour who still pines for him. And it&#8217;s hard to work up sympathy for him.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>You stare in the mirror at the lines in your face</em><br />\n<em>And you try to see, girl</em><br />\n<em>The way things were when we were at your place</em><br />\n<em>In the days it was just you and me, girl</em><br />\n<em>And you cry because things ain&#8217;t like before</em><br />\n<em>Well don&#8217;t you know they can&#8217;t be that way anymore</em><br />\n<em>But don&#8217;t worry baby</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>But I can&#8217;t talk now, I&#8217;m not alone</em><br />\n<em>So put your ear close to the phone</em><br />\n<em>&#8216;Cause this is the last dance</em><br />\n<em>This is the last chance for hearts of stone</em></p>\n<p>We&#8217;re given to think that this is not a young couple. The unnamed, offscreen woman that Bruce sings to stares at the wrinkles on her face, as aware of her advancing age as she is of her loneliness.</p>\n<p>She&#8217;s lost in the past and in her tears, unable to move forward from their affair, and all Bruce&#8217;s narrator has to offer is a &#8220;sorry, but that&#8217;s the way it is&#8221; and a blithely clever Beach Boys callback&#8211;even though for the woman at least, it seems that things most assuredly won&#8217;t turn out alright.</p>\n<p>Even when she just wants to hear his voice, our narrator warns her: <em>Don&#8217;t call me again. This is the last time we&#8217;ll talk.</em></p>\n<p>Hearts of stone, indeed.</p>\n<p>The title plays on the different kind of mettle required by each ex-lover: he feels the need to be stoic if not cold in order to make their finality definitive; she needs to harden her heart to protect herself from heartbreak.</p>\n<p>Bruce softens his narrator a bit in the second verse, his veneer cracking a bit as he almost pleads with her to understand. He doesn&#8217;t accept responsibility, though, and he urges her to take solace in her vivid memories of their time together.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>If there was something, baby, that I could do</em><br />\n<em>Something that would last, honey, I would</em><br />\n<em>But we all know, girl, especially you do</em><br />\n<em>How you can&#8217;t return to your past, no</em><br />\n<em>So girl close your eyes and I&#8217;ll be there</em><br />\n<em>Hold me once more and we can go anywhere</em><br />\n<em>Ah, we could babe</em></p>\n<p>I imagine she takes very little comfort from that, but if there&#8217;s any to be found at all, it&#8217;s in The Big Man&#8217;s swooningly soulful sax solo. If your heart doesn&#8217;t break a bit when listening to it, it&#8217;s probably made of, well, stone.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Hearts of Stone&#8221; doesn&#8217;t resolve. There&#8217;s no ending or epilogue to be found, happy or otherwise. We&#8217;re left at the moment of peak heartache for both participants.</p>\n<p>This song is about the armor it requires to move on from a situation that was very likely destined for a painful conclusion from the start. It may be cold in parts, but it&#8217;s also honest. Some fans and critics have called it too heartfelt for the dour <em>Darkness,\u00a0</em>but I&#8217;d argue the reverse: Bruce&#8217;s fourth album is a collection of songs rooted in resistance, persistence, and defiance.\u00a0&#8220;Hearts of Stone&#8221; delivers a much simpler and starker message:\u00a0<em>It&#8217;s over.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Given how wholly and completely Southside made &#8220;Hearts of Stone&#8221; his own, its no surprise that Bruce steered far clear of it in concert for almost four decades. He only performed it once during the twentieth century, and only as a surprise guest star during Southside&#8217;s San Francisco performance in November 1988.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, that debut performance kind of sucked.</p>\n<p>The blame can&#8217;t be placed with Bruce, though: the fault lies with Southside, who so thoroughly and completely forgets the lyrics that it&#8217;s painful to listen to. (I suppose we could blame Bruce for not coming to his buddy&#8217;s rescue sooner.)</p>\n<audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-32951-5\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/1988-11-26-Hearts-of-Stone.mp3?_=5\" /><a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/1988-11-26-Hearts-of-Stone.mp3\">https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/1988-11-26-Hearts-of-Stone.mp3</a></audio>\n<p>It would take a full quarter-century after that before Bruce would attempt &#8220;Hearts of Stone&#8221; on his own.
