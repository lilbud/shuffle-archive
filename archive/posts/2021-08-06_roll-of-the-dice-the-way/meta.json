Sometimes they were meant as practical jokes (to startle the listener after a minute or more of silence), and sometimes they were just last-minute additions to the album after the artwork and liner notes had been completed.</p>\n<p>In the 1990s glory days of the compact disc, it seemed\u00a0everyone was releasing discs with hidden tracks: Nirvana, Green Day, Beck, Nine Inch Nails, Guns and Roses, Dr. Dre, and a host of other popular artists all took part in the practice.</p>\n<p>Bruce Springsteen, however, avoided it completely until his 2007 album <em>Magic</em>, which included an unlisted track called &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/07/30/roll-of-the-dice-terrys-song/\">Terry&#8217;s Song.</a>&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Terry&#039;s Song\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jo9tv7J0HR8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>That track wasn&#8217;t hidden so much as as unacknowledged; it was a late addition to the album after Bruce wrote and recorded it as a tribute for the late Terry Magovern, Bruce&#8217;s friend and assistant, after Magovern passed away just weeks before the album&#8217;s release. The album had already been completed, and in fact early copies of it didn&#8217;t include the extra track at all.</p>\n<p>Three years later, though, Bruce released an album with a track that was hidden in the truest sense: At the end of the second disc of <em>The Promise</em>, a compilation of Darkness-era outtakes, Bruce appended a song called &#8220;The Way&#8221; to the album&#8217;s final track (&#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/06/28/roll-of-the-dice-city-of-night/\">City of Night</a>&#8220;) after a twenty-second pause.</p>\n<p>Bruce was so determined to hide the song that he didn&#8217;t even make it a separate track. Even today, the only way to listen to an official recording of it is to play through the first three minutes or so of &#8220;City at Night&#8221; until &#8220;The Way&#8221; kicks in.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"City of Night\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rtI5TxfhhUU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;The Way&#8221; certainly wasn&#8217;t a last-minute recording like &#8220;Terry&#8217;s Song.&#8221; Bruce recorded it with the E Street Band more than three decades earlier.</p>\n<p>So why did he bury &#8220;The Way&#8221; so deeply?</p>\n<p>&#8220;Because I never liked it!&#8221; Bruce laughed during an interview on E Street Radio in 2010.</p>\n<p>Bruce knew that fans had a soft spot for the outtake (especially his former producer Jimmy Iovine, who &#8220;lobbied for it in &#8217;78 like he was gonna keel over&#8221;) thanks to a bootleg version that had been circulating for years, but he thought its proper home would have been &#8220;in a David Lynch film over a sexually perverse scene.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He booted &#8220;The Way&#8221; off of<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/07/05/album-companion-darkness-on-the-edge-of-town/\">\u00a0<em>Darkness on the Edge of Town</em></a> not long before the album&#8217;s release (replacing it with the similarly paced but more dour &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/10/31/roll-of-the-dice-factory/\">Factory</a>&#8220;). He rejected it from <em>Tracks</em> in 1998. He even scratched it from the bonus disc that came with\u00a0<em>The Essential Bruce Springsteen</em> in 2003, after initially slotting it in the leadoff position.</p>\n<p>Perhaps sensing the fan uproar that would have ensued had he left it off his definitive Darkness outtake collection in 2010 (or simply the tongue-lashing he would have and did receive from Iovine, who called Bruce up after\u00a0<em>The Promise</em> was released, only to be playfully chided for not listening to the album all the way through), Bruce finally relented and let his long locked-away creation out into the world.</p>\n<p>After all that, one would expect that &#8220;The Way&#8221; would be a genuine stinker. But it&#8217;s not&#8211;in fact, it&#8217;s a quite lovely ode to romantic fidelity. Well, for the first half of the song, at least. It takes a turn for the strange at the instrumental break, as we&#8217;ll see in a moment.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s take a close listen:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>The way your heart beats when I hold you tight</em><br />\n<em>The way you sigh when we kiss goodnight</em><br />\n<em>The way the wind blows through the trees</em><br />\n<em>Well hey, that&#8217;s the way you belong to me</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>The way you warm me baby when I&#8217;m cold</em><br />\n<em>The way you make me want you body and soul</em><br />\n<em>The way the rivers run to the sea</em><br />\n<em>Well hey, that&#8217;s the way you belong to me</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>The way you soothe me when I&#8217;m in pain</em><br />\n<em>The way you make the blood rush in my veins</em><br />\n<em>The way the winds rush through the trees</em><br />\n<em>Well hey, that&#8217;s the way you belong to me</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>When I lose faith you take my hand</em><br />\n<em>The way you make me feel like I&#8217;m a man</em><br />\n<em>The way the sun belongs to the sea</em><br />\n<em>Well hey, that&#8217;s the way you belong to me</em></p>\n<p>So far, so good. Bruce has constructed a song entirely of comparisons of his narrator&#8217;s love with the most natural, reliable, and romantic constants in his life.</p>\n<p>All the while, the E Street Band provides gradual and stately accompaniment, building in power through the third verse as our narrator&#8217;s comparisons grow increasingly passionate. It&#8217;s only when the song takes a moment to breathe through Clarence&#8217;s warm solo that we realize that we&#8217;re four verses in and our narrator has yet to talk about the way <em>he</em> loves\u00a0<em>her.</em></p>\n<p>And with that realization, the song starts to get a little bit creepy:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>The way you make me feel like I belong</em><br />\n<em>And if I could girl though I know it&#8217;d be wrong</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;d lock you deep inside &#8217;till the last rains fall</em><br />\n<em>And hide you from the emptiness of it all</em></p>\n<p>Wait, what? Who wants to lock their lover away from the world until the end of time? Suddenly Bruce&#8217;s David Lynch comment seems like not that much of an imaginative stretch.</p>\n<p>Bruce reels us back into less questionable territory for the final verse, which includes a couplet that would someday appear in <a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/03/04/roll-of-the-dice-the-river/\">a song that he&#8217;d think much more highly of</a>:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Sometimes at night I lie awake</em><br />\n<em>I pull you close and feel each breath you take</em><br />\n<em>The way the rivers belong to the seas</em><br />\n<em>Well hey, that&#8217;s the way you belong to me</em></p>\n<p>Setting aside the narrator&#8217;s self-centeredness and borderline obsession, &#8220;The Way&#8221; is a sweet little song that doesn&#8217;t seem deserving of its creator&#8217;s scorn. It&#8217;s easy to hear why it was left off of\u00a0<em>Darkness on the Edge of Town</em>, though: it takes a close listen to discern the darkness lurking on the song&#8217;s periphery. (It&#8217;s there, though.)</p>\n<p>Most listeners would have probably heard it as a sweet romantic pledge that would have become a wedding dance standard. Not that there&#8217;s anything wrong with that, but that&#8217;s definitely not what Bruce was aiming for with that particular album.</p>\n<p>Given Bruce&#8217;s distaste for the song, it&#8217;s not surprising that he hasn&#8217;t played &#8220;The Way&#8221; in concert. With Bruce, we&#8217;ve learned to never say never, but I&#8217;d lay very long odds against us hearing this one live.</p>\n<p><strong>The Way<br />\nRecorded:</strong> August 1977 &#8211; February 1978<br />\n<strong>Released:\u00a0</strong><em>The Promise</em> (2010)<br />\n<strong>Never performed\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
