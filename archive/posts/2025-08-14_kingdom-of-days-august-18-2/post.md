Bruce makes a surprise afternoon appearance at the annual Clearwater Festival in Asbury Park, playing six songs (including the first ever acoustic performance of ““). The video footage below is unintentionally hilarious at times: first, a local news reporter tries multiple times to do a “guess who that is over there” intro, but an oblivious Bruce fails to cooperate; later, a group performance of “” is, let’s say, ragtag. And that poor ASL interpreter–how hard must it be to sign song?
