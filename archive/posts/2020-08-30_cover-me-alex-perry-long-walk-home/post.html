<p>Okay, I actually don’t know <em>anything </em>about him, except that he delivers a surprisingly solid one-man cover of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/03/21/roll-of-the-dice-long-walk-home/">Long Walk Home</a>.”</p>
<p>He breaks my usual cover rule (do it different or do it better), because except for the ending, his arrangement hews very close to the original <em>Magic </em> version. But he gets bonus points not just for nailing all the instruments, but for a great vocal, mix, and video production as well.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, Perry is the only person involved with this entire production, and that’s a pretty mean accomplishment.</p>
<p>Nicely done, Alex!</p>
