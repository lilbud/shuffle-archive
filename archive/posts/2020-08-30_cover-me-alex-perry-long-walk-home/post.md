I don’t know much about Alex Perry.

Okay, I actually don’t know *anything* about him, except that he delivers a surprisingly solid one-man cover of “[Long Walk Home](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/03/21/roll-of-the-dice-long-walk-home/).”

He breaks my usual cover rule (do it different or do it better), because except for the ending, his arrangement hews very close to the original *Magic* version. But he gets bonus points not just for nailing all the instruments, but for a great vocal, mix, and video production as well.

As far as I can tell, Perry is the only person involved with this entire production, and that’s a pretty mean accomplishment.

Nicely done, Alex!
