**1993:** Bruce plays a full-length concert at Madison Square Garden to benefit the new Kristen Ann Carr Fund. This show serves as an epilogue to World Tour 1993 and is the last appearance of the 1992-1993 touring band. Joe Ely, Soozie Tyrell, and Terrence Trent D’Arby all make guest appearances, but D’Arby’s contribution is not appreciated by fans in attendance, who boo him so noticeably that Bruce, visibly peeved, tells off the crowd.
