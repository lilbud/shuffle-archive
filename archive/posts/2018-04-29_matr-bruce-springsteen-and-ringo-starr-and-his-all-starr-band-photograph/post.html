<p>When the tour came around to the Garden State Arts Center, Bruce joined his bandmates on-stage during the encores for four songs, including Ringo’s hit, “Photograph.”</p>

<p>This was the only time Bruce is known to have performed “Photograph.” Two months later, Bruce re-connected with Clarence and Nils during Starr’s Japanese tour leg–this time by phone, to break the news that he was ending the E Street Band.</p>
