<p>In 1989, with no E Street Band tour on the horizon, Clarence and Nils joined the original incarnation of Ringo Starr’s All-Star Band (which also included Levon Helm, Joe Walsh, Dr. John, Billy Preston, and other great artists).</p>
<p>When the tour came around to the Garden State Arts Center, Bruce joined his bandmates on-stage during the encores for four songs, including Ringo’s hit, “Photograph.”</p>

<p>This was the only time Bruce is known to have performed “Photograph.” Two months later, Bruce re-connected with Clarence and Nils during Starr’s Japanese tour leg–this time by phone, to break the news that he was ending the E Street Band.</p>
