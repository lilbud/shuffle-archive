<p>“I wasn’t super familiar with Jerry Butler until I went searching for material for this record,” Springsteen told <em>Asbury Park Press </em>interviewer Chris Jordan last year. “Jon Landau was the huge Jerry Butler fan and he suggested ‘Hey, Western Union Man’ and I said I don’t know.”</p>

<p>Springsteen had never heard the song before, but trusting his manager he listened to it. “It was kind of complicated, and then I got into it really deeply.”</p>
<p>It <em>is</em> a bit complicated. Butler wrote the song with legendary songwriters Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff. (The three also collaborated on “Only the Strong Survive.”) They gave the song a Philly soul groove, but its gimmick is the chorus change-up that briefly kicks the song into a staccato rhythm that sounds exactly like the musical equivalent of a Western Union  telegram.</p>
<p>(For the young’uns: telegrams were Morse code messages transmitted over long distances by electrical impulses in pre-Internet, pre-telephone days (although some 17 million telegrams are still sent annually even today).)</p>

<p>The gimmick worked. “Hey, Western Union Man” cut through the radio clutter and clawed its way to #16 on the Billboard Hot 100 and all the way to the top of the R&amp;B chart. It was novel and popular enough that both The Supremes and William Bell (both of whom are also represented on <em>Only the Strong Survive</em>) covered the song as album tracks in the year or two after the song’s release.</p>

<p>Neither cover was released as a single, and “Hey, Western Union Man” went largely uncovered after that until Landau introduced it to Springsteen more than fifty years later.</p>
<p>Bruce’s cover hews pretty closely to Butler’s original, preserving the arrangement and taking very few lyrical liberties. It’s a wise choice: the arrangement is a key ingredient to the song’s recipe.</p>

<p>“Hey, Western Union Man” converted Springsteen into a Butler fan. He ended up covering not only the two Butler songs that grace his latest album, but (as he told NPR in a December 2022 interview) “several other of the songs” from Butler’s 1968 album, <em>The Iceman Cometh</em>.</p>
<p>Although he gave no specifics, I’m betting we’ll hear Butler’s “Never Give You Up” on Bruce’s rumored follow-up cover album–hopefully someday soon.</p>
