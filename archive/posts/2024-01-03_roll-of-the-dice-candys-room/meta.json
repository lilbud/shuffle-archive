We&#8217;ve covered a lot of essential ground already, so if you haven&#8217;t already read the first two installments or could use a refresher, I highly recommend starting with these two <em>Roll of the Dice </em>installments before reading any further:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/09/02/roll-of-the-dice-candys-boy/\">Candy&#8217;s Boy</a>&#8221; (September 2020)</li>\n<li>&#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/01/30/roll-of-the-dice-the-fast-song/\">The Fast Song</a>&#8221; (January 2021)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Caught up? Great&#8211;then let&#8217;s continue.</p>\n</div></div>\n<p>We left Bruce and the band on September 2, 1977&#8211;the day they finished both the version of &#8220;Candy&#8217;s Boy&#8221; that appears on\u00a0<em>The Promise</em> and the last known version of &#8220;The Fast Song.&#8221; In the latter, Bruce had the completed music for &#8220;Candy&#8217;s Room,&#8221; but the lyrics were still floating unresolved between the two.</p>\n<p>It was at this point that Bruce began to merge the sibling songs. As September progressed, &#8220;Candy&#8217;s Boy&#8221; and &#8220;The Fast Song&#8221; came together in the creatively titled &#8220;New Fast Song (Candy).&#8221; In a surviving page of handwritten lyrics, we can see the ideas starting to coalesce.</p>\n<p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-attachment-id=\"34357\" data-permalink=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/05/02/roll-of-the-dice-candys-room/newfastsong/#main\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/newfastsong.jpg?fit=559%2C720&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"559,720\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"newfastsong\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/newfastsong.jpg?fit=233%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/newfastsong.jpg?fit=559%2C720&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-34357\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/newfastsong.jpg?resize=758%2C976&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"758\" height=\"976\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/newfastsong.jpg?w=559&amp;ssl=1 559w, https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/newfastsong.jpg?resize=233%2C300&amp;ssl=1 233w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 758px) 100vw, 758px\" /></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>In Candy&#8217;s room she has pictures of her savior on the wall</em><br />\n<em>But to get to Candy&#8217;s room you got to walk Candy&#8217;s hall</em><br />\n<em>Strangers from the city call my baby&#8217;s number</em><br />\n<em>They bring Candy toys but when I come knockin&#8217;</em><br />\n<em>She smiles pretty, she knows I&#8217;m gonna be Candy&#8217;s boy</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>There somewhere in\u00a0<span class=\"colored-text\">the</span> darkness\u00a0I find hidden worlds that shine</em><br />\n<em>Through the fear <span class=\"colored-text\">blackness</span>\u00a0mist</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em><span class=\"colored-text\">Then</span> when we kiss my hearts <span class=\"colored-text\">explodes</span> through my skin</em><br />\n<em>For <span class=\"colored-text\">with</span> a moment she lets me in</em><br />\n<em>That&#8217;s when the sadness begins</em><br />\n<em>I get visions of avenging angels of eden</em><br />\n<em>With them white horses and flaming swords</em><br />\n<em>Can blow this whole town into the sea</em><br />\n<em>But they cant touch Candy and me</em><br />\n<em>Our love they cannot destroy</em><br />\n<em>I will forever be Candy&#8217;s boy</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>She says baby if you wanna be wild you got a lot to learn</em><br />\n<em>You gotta let your heart burn</em><br />\n<em>So come with me together baby we&#8217;ll drive all</em><br />\n<em><span class=\"colored-text\">We&#8217;ll go</span> drivin&#8217; together into the night</em><br />\n<em>through the heart of a fire fight with no rain</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>We go driving south through the pines <span class=\"colored-text\">???\u00a0</span>the out roads</em><br />\n<em>that ??? off the line and then we kiss</em><br />\n<em>From a world we&#8217;ll meet / burn / take / know / without end</em></p>\n<p>We&#8217;re getting closer to the final version of &#8220;Candy&#8217;s Room,&#8221; now:\u00a0 The first verse is there (it&#8217;s the one consistent component from the very beginning of the song&#8217;s evolution), and we see hints of the second (although this version contains lyrics that will make their way to &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/02/01/roll-of-the-dice-iceman/\">Iceman</a>&#8220;).</p>\n<p>The bridge is there too, although it&#8217;s a bit distributed. It&#8217;s only at the end of the song that Bruce seems to run out of steam, losing both power and coherence.</p>\n<p>Bruce continued tinkering and polishing throughout the month, but sometimes evolution doesn&#8217;t happen in a straight line. On September 30, Bruce sat down at the piano and played yet another new version of what was quickly becoming &#8220;Candy&#8217;s Room,&#8221; and his demonstration was captured on video by Barry Rebo.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Candy&#039;s Room Demo (NYC, 78) (from Thrill Hill Vault 1976-1978)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0VJZpmNy-OI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>This version contains almost entirely new lyrics, but thematically the heart of the song remains intact:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>In the night, all the lights will shine</em><br />\n<em>With people laughing all the time</em><br />\n<em>I went down to that house that sits on the edge of town</em><br />\n<em>Shining so fine and so bright, so full of light</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Tonight, I got a feeling that I can&#8217;t face</em><br />\n<em>And tonight, I got a loneliness I can&#8217;t erase</em><br />\n<em>I got a hunger that drives me down</em><br />\n<em>Down to the gates of the house</em><br />\n<em>That waits on the edge of town</em><br />\n<em>Feeding my fears night after night</em><br />\n<em>And for me, she&#8217;s waiting in the window</em><br />\n<em>I see her face with a beauty that time can&#8217;t erase</em><br />\n<em>Hidden from the sound, hidden from the light, hidden from the world&#8230; tonight</em></p>\n<p>From here, evidence suggests the song cohered rather quickly, with recording sessions for the final track taking place between late October and mid-December, with three days of intensive overdubbing and mixing in early March until a final version (take 42 out of a total of 79) was selected for <a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/07/05/album-companion-darkness-on-the-edge-of-town/\"><em>Darkness on the Edge of Town</em></a>.</p>\n<p>After almost two years of pruning and grafting, finessing and fine-tuning, &#8220;Candy&#8217;s Room&#8221; was complete.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Candy&#039;s Room\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CyPfb0vOVfo?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>And now that we&#8217;ve listened to the final track, we can finally ask the question: What&#8217;s it all about?</p>\n<p>Who is Candy? Is she&#8211;as many (including this blogger) have suggested&#8211;a prostitute? (When Brian Hiatt put the question to him in 2010, Bruce simply laughed it off: &#8220;Does it matter? Does it really matter? I&#8217;ll never tell.&#8221;) Or was she&#8211;as two of his former girlfriends seem to believe&#8211;based on a former paramour?</p>\n<p>My opening sentence in the first installment of this trilogy was: &#8220;Candy was\u00a0<em>definitely\u00a0</em>a hooker, and it absolutely matters.&#8221; I stand by my assessment: it certainly wouldn&#8217;t be either the first or last time Bruce cast a lady of the evening as his femme fatale.</p>\n<p>But in fairness, after travelling the long and winding road from &#8220;Candy&#8217;s Boy&#8221; and &#8220;The Fast Song&#8221; to &#8220;Candy&#8217;s Room,&#8221; a fair argument can be made that Candy is a composite more than a character, and the song an impression moreso than a narrative. Bruce&#8217;s song went through so many iterations and so much evolution that it&#8217;s hard to make the case for a clear artistic vision from the outset.</p>\n<p>That said, the first verse is vivid enough to strongly suggest\u00a0 that Candy is a professional lover&#8230;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>In Candy&#8217;s room, there are pictures of her heroes on the wall</em><br />\n<em>But to get to Candy&#8217;s room, you gotta walk the darkness of Candy&#8217;s hall</em><br />\n<em>Strangers from the city call my baby&#8217;s number and they bring her toys</em><br />\n<em>When I come knocking, she smiles pretty, she knows I wanna be Candy&#8217;s boy</em></p>\n<p>&#8230;and its consistent and continual inclusion as the opening verse of the song from its very earliest incarnations convinces me that &#8220;Candy&#8217;s Room&#8221; requires a narrator in love with an escort. Bruce also strongly suggests that the narrator is one of Candy&#8217;s clients, one of lesser material means than her other, more well-heeled johns.</p>\n<p>But if he can&#8217;t compete financially, our self-styled hero can at least offer Candy true passion and connection&#8211;or so he&#8217;s convinced himself. Our narrator has cast himself as Candy&#8217;s would-be savior, certain that she must feel the same rush that he does when they&#8217;re together.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>There&#8217;s a sadness hidden in that pretty face</em><br />\n<em>A sadness all her own, from which no man can keep Candy safe</em><br />\n<em>We kiss, my heart&#8217;s rushes to my brain</em><br />\n<em>And the blood rushes in my veins, the fire rushes towards the sky</em><br />\n<em>And then we go driving, driving deep into the night</em><br />\n<em>I go driving deep into the light, in Candy&#8217;s eyes</em></p>\n<p>We should pause our lyrical analysis for a moment to acknowledge the brilliance of the backing track. For a song pieced together from parts, it&#8217;s astounding how well the final lyrics and music reflect each other. In large part, this is because Bruce abandons concern with meter and form, delivering his vocals in spoken-word for much of the song, and matching the music&#8217;s flourishes.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Candy&#8217;s Room&#8221; is instantly recognizable in its opening second purely from Max Weinberg&#8217;s unique drum introduction, which carries us through the first verse. (Max once called &#8220;Candy&#8217;s Room&#8221; his favorite Springsteen song to play.) Paired with Bruce&#8217;s flat, quiet, almost numb vocals, it creates a simmering, carefully constrained effect, as if our narrator is struggling to contain his seething jealousy.</p>\n<p>But when he begins to describe their love-making, the song opens up&#8211;the musical accompaniment to rushing blood and heart and fire. And when Candy finally speaks, the song reaches its climax too, in a screaming guitar-solo of a bridge.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>She says, &#8220;baby if you wanna be wild, you got a lot to learn</em><br />\n<em>Close your eyes, let them melt, let them fire, let them burn&#8221;</em><br />\n<em>&#8216;Cause in the darkness, there&#8217;ll be hidden worlds that shine</em><br />\n<em>When I hold Candy close she makes these hidden worlds mine</em></p>\n<p>Finally, though, our narrator returns to reality&#8211;a reality in which he can&#8217;t compete with the expensive gifts lavished on her by her other suitors. So he convinces himself that he doesn&#8217;t need to: his connection with Candy is special rather than professional, and while he may have to accept her sharing her body, he&#8217;s got exclusive dibs on Candy&#8217;s heart.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>She has fancy clothes and diamond rings</em><br />\n<em>She has men who give her anything she wants, but they don&#8217;t see</em><br />\n<em>That what she wants is me</em><br />\n<em>Oh and I want her so, I&#8217;ll never let her go, no no no</em><br />\n<em>She knows that I&#8217;d give all that I got to give</em><br />\n<em>All that I want, all that I live to make Candy mine</em><br />\n<em>Tonight</em></p>\n<p>While never stated, the implication that Candy is a sex worker casts doubt on the reliability of our narrator. Does he truly have an intimate connection with the object of his affection? Possibly. But a skilled courtesan would likely convince her customer of that regardless of whether it was true, and the suggestion that our protagonist is or was originally a client suggests that he&#8217;s not quite as certain as he tries to sound.</p>\n<p>Whether he&#8217;s correct, naive, or delusional is something we never learn, and it&#8217;s that uncertainty that shades &#8220;Candy&#8217;s Room&#8221; as one of the darker tracks on an already very dark album.</p>\n<p>I know fans who have softer interpretations of &#8220;Candy&#8217;s Room&#8221; than I do, and one could certainly and willfully read it as a boy of modest means attempting to woo a high-society girl, but contextual clues in both the song and on the album itself convince at least this normally romantically-inclined blogger to take a more cynical view.</p>\n<p>But more importantly, the Candy-as-courtesan interpretation supports the central conceit of the entire\u00a0<em>Darkness on the Edge of Town\u00a0</em>album: that even in the darkest of circumstance and context, Bruce&#8217;s characters cling to romance and idealism (whether by courage or delusion), caught up in a struggle that never resolves, standing on that hill with everything they&#8217;ve got.</p>\n<p>In the end, &#8220;Candy&#8217;s Room&#8221; is yet another Springsteen song about a loser who knows the deck is stacked against him and yet refuses to concede the fight.\u00a0 But it&#8217;s also arguably the most visceral such song.</p>\n<p>We never do find out Candy&#8217;s side of the situation or her feelings for her would-be Romeo. Maybe she really is just making a living, or maybe she&#8217;s truly won over by his passion. We never learn, because the point of &#8220;Candy&#8217;s Room&#8221; isn&#8217;t the outcome but rather the struggle.</p>\n<p>To win Candy&#8217;s heart, you have to reach Candy&#8217;s room. (The latter is a metaphor for the former, in case that isn&#8217;t clear by now.)</p>\n<p>And to reach Candy&#8217;s room, you have to walk that long, dark hall.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen &amp; The E Street Band - Candy&#039;s Room (Live in Houston, 1978)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_xNmLBwPwxw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen &amp; The E Street Band - Candy&#039;s Room (Live at The Paramount Theatre 2009)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/w2Q7bb0szOE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><strong>Candy&#8217;s Room<br />\nRecorded:</strong> October 27, 1977 &#8211; March 5, 1978<br />\n<strong>Released:\u00a0</strong><em>Darkness on the Edge of Town\u00a0</em>(1978)<br />\n<strong>First performed:</strong> May 23, 1978 (Buffalo, NY)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> August 26, 2023 (Foxborough, MA)</p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
