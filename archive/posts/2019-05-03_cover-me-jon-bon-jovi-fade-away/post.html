<p>The original Youtube poster cites this as hailing from Jon Bon Jovi’s sole stop in Japan on his 1997 <em>Destination Anywhere</em> tour, and I have no reason doubt that.</p>
<p>If so, however, someone needs to correct the setlist record, because there’s no mention of Jon’s beautiful cover of Bruce’s “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/04/28/roll-of-the-dice-fade-away/">Fade Away</a>” below.</p>

<p>Interestingly, though, the setlist archive indicates that John opened the show with “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/06/24/cover-me-not-fade-away/">Not Fade Away</a>” (an entirely different Buddy Holly song) and encored with Bruce’s “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/09/07/roll-of-the-dice-hearts-of-stone/">Hearts of Stone</a>.” Perhaps one of those is a mistaken reference to “Fade Away” instead.</p>
<p>Regardless of where it was, though, Jon gave a lovely and faithful performance of the song that night, and it’s a worthy addition to the vast catalog of Springsteen covers.</p>
