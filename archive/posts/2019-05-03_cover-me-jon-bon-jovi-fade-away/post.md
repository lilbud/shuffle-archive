I don’t know much about the source of today’s video; perhaps some Bon Jovi fans can help me out.

The original Youtube poster cites this as hailing from Jon Bon Jovi’s sole stop in Japan on his 1997 *Destination Anywhere* tour, and I have no reason doubt that.

If so, however, someone needs to correct the setlist record, because there’s no mention of Jon’s beautiful cover of Bruce’s “[Fade Away](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/04/28/roll-of-the-dice-fade-away/)” below.

Interestingly, though, the setlist archive indicates that John opened the show with “[Not Fade Away](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/06/24/cover-me-not-fade-away/)” (an entirely different Buddy Holly song) and encored with Bruce’s “[Hearts of Stone](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/09/07/roll-of-the-dice-hearts-of-stone/).” Perhaps one of those is a mistaken reference to “Fade Away” instead.

Regardless of where it was, though, Jon gave a lovely and faithful performance of the song that night, and it’s a worthy addition to the vast catalog of Springsteen covers.
