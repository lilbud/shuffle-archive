Wilson Pickett was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in January 1991, and Bruce was on-hand along with a host of other rock icons to pay tribute.</p>\n<p>The\u00a0 evening would undoubtedly have culminated in an all-star jam with Pickett that included &#8220;In the Midnight Hour,&#8221; but there was only one problem: Pickett&#8217;s flight was delayed due to fog, and he missed the entire event. (It was the start of a bad decade for the notoriously flawed Pickett.)</p>\n<p>Instead, John Fogerty, Chaka Khan, and Phoebe Snow traded lead vocals with Bruce (backed by Jackson Browne, Bonnie Raitt, Don Henley, and more) on &#8220;In the Midnight Hour.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen, Chaka Khan, John Fogerty &amp; More - &quot;In the Midnight Hour&quot; | 1991 Induction\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/S3eEz680qYg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>It was a great performance, but it couldn&#8217;t match the experience of Bruce and Wilson sharing a stage together.
