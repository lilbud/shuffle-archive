meta-description: Talk about an obscure cover–“Unsatisfied Heart” has never been released or performed, but The War on Drugs nailed it last month in San Diego.

I’m a sucker for a good cover of an obscure Bruce song, and this one is as obscure as it gets.

Never released, never performed: Bruce Springsteen’s “,” performed in San Diego by The War on Drugs on April 15, 2018. Looks like they know where to find the great bootlegs!
