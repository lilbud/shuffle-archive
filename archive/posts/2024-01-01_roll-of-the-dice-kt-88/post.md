The dice take us into seriously obscure territory today:

KT-88 is an instrumental jam that Bruce wrote in the autumn of 1969. He played it with Child, and then with Steel Mill, before it disappeared forever early in the E Street Band’s career. (There are unverified reports of Bruce performing this with the ESB in the early stages of the Greetings from Asbury Park tour.)

Here’s one of the band’s final performances, from the summer of 1970.
