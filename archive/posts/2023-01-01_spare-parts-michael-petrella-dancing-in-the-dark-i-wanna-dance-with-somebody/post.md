And now for something completely different:

I don’t have a blog category for mash-ups, but maybe I should, because I’ve got a few of these in my back pocket to share.

Let’s start with Michael Petrella and Eric. I don’t know much about Michael (and even less about Eric, like whether he has a last name), but I do know he’s got a pretty clever ear for a mash-up. I don’t think I could have ever come up with a Bruce Springsteen/Whitney Houston pairing that would work well, but Michael and Eric sure did.

Check out their clever cover mash-up of “” with “I Wanna Dance With Somebody.” Not only do they blend well musically, the lyrics match hand-in-glove, too.
