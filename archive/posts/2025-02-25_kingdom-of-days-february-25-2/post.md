**1974:** Sick with the flu, Bruce somehow manages to perform at The Main Point in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, but he is forced to sit for the entire performance. Even though he’s sick, a photo from this evening will become the cover of *Tracks* 24 years later. (photo credits: Phil Ceccola)

**1986:** Grammy-nominated “[Born in the U.S.A.](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/09/21/roll-of-the-dice-born-in-the-u-s-a/)” loses the Record of the Year award to “[We Are the World](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/01/30/matr-bruce-springsteen-and-just-about-everyone-we-are-the-world/)” (which at least features Bruce’s vocals).

**1988:** The Tunnel of Love Express Tour kicks off in Worcester, Massachusetts. Most *[Tunnel of Love](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/08/08/album-companion-tunnel-of-love/)*songs receive their first concert airings, and old standards are played with new arrangements. Unheard outtakes and covers round out a tightly thematic set list and a very different Springsteen show than most fans have ever heard. The Miami Horns join the E Street Band for this tour, temporarily renamed The Horns of Love.
