**1988:** The Tunnel of Love Express Tour kicks off in Worcester, Massachusetts. Most *[Tunnel of Love](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/08/08/album-companion-tunnel-of-love/)*songs receive their first concert airings, and old standards are played with new arrangements. Unheard outtakes and covers round out a tightly thematic set list and a very different Springsteen show than most fans have ever heard. The Miami Horns join the E Street Band for this tour, temporarily renamed The Horns of Love.
