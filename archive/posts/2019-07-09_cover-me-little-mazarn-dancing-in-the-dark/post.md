I’m not sure how to describe Little Mazarn’s sound; “new age/Appalachian” may be as close as I can get.

It’s not worth getting hung up on categories, though, because no matter where you assign it, Little Mazarn’s cover of Bruce’s “[Dancing in the Dark](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/12/25/roll-of-the-dice-dancing-in-the-dark/)” is gorgeous, haunting, and unique. It’ll stick with you long after the first listen.

You can find her version on her new 2019 album, *Io*, released mere weeks ago (as I write this, anyway).

Bonus: here’s a live performance from a few months before the album’s release. It’s not quite as stunning as the album version, but the context perfectly captures the isolation and loneliness in Bruce’s lyrics.
