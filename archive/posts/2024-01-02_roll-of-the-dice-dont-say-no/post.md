meta-description: We may not be able to make out the lyrics for “Don’t Say No,” but the backing track is a keeper. Too bad Bruce didn’t find a home for it–although it’s not for lack of trying.

Bruce really, really, wanted to find a home for the instrumental track that backs his unreleased song, “Don’t Say No.” He used it not once but twice in 1977–and then a third time in 1979.

*really*

But all three songs (“Don’t Say No” “,” and ““) remain unreleased–and as far as we know, unfinished–to this day.

[I Want to Be Wild](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/03/07/roll-of-the-dice-i-want-to-be-wild/)[Out on the Run](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/05/20/roll-of-the-dice-out-on-the-run/)

But since Bruce tried so hard to make a go of it, let’s give “Don’t Say No” a listen anyway. I’ll warn you, though: Bruce’s vocals are very, deep in the mix, so you may need the lyrics below (such as they are, and such as I can interpret) to follow along.

*very*

Barreling out of the gate on the back of Max’s ““-ish intro, “Don’t Say No” quickly settles into a hard rocking riff that really should have ended up somewhere in Bruce’s catalog. The E Street Band gets a workout here, which helps hide the fact that Bruce’s bluffed lyrics are barely intelligible.

Thanks to folks at Springsteenlyrics.com, we’ve got at least something to go on, but honestly I think much of the lyrics listed for this song are just bluffed nonsense, so I took the liberty of removing the lines I don’t think are actually on the song and don’t match what I hear. (You can check out their lyrics page , though, if you want to read what they hear).

*I remember, girl, you were walking down my street*  
*Well, you were ??? I’d seen my baby*  
*You know she loves him and I can’t beat her style*  
*Right now I wanna ???*  
*Bring it home, try it out, I’ll do just whatever you want*



*Don’t say no!*



*???*  
*???*  
*But I’m a real live wire and I’m feeling right outside*  
*Right now I’ll get down on my knees, you know I’m wild*  
*???*



*Don’t say no!*



*There’s a cool river and a color and fire when I came here*  
*Well I’ve been on that high road searching for you*  
*And I love you girl and I want you girl and I swear*  
*Even when you’re lonesome, baby, I’m beside you*  
*I’m your captive, I’m a little downside*  
*Ah, and I want you and I’m gonna get you and I’m gonna treat you and I’m gonna love you*  
*Alright, I’m ready to rip, open up and then bring it home*



*Don’t say no!*

In any event, even the lyrics that we can make out make it clear that “Don’t Say No” was never going to end up on Despite being rehearsed during that album’s sessions, “Don’t Say No” is more than . Had Bruce developed it into a final song, however, it would have made a fine candidate for .
