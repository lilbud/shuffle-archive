<p>But when a Beatle passes, there’s really no other choice for a rock and roll musician but to pay one’s respects.</p>
<p>So that’s exactly what Bruce did, by opening his first show with a cover of one of Harrison’s songs. And although George left no shortage of songs from which to choose, there was really only one obvious choice.</p>
<p>Harrison wrote “Something” for The Beatles’ <em>Abbey Road</em> album, and when it was issued as a single with “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/01/15/meeting-across-the-river-bruce-springsteen-and-axl-rose/">Come Together</a>” on the flip-side, it became his first-ever A-side and not only topped the Billboard Hot 100 but also went to #1 in Canada, Australia, West Germany, and New Zealand.</p>

<p>“Something” quickly became The Beatles’ second most-covered song (after “Yesterday”) and the 17th most-performed song of the 20th century. Bruce made sure it was carried into the 21st as well.</p>
<p>On December 3rd 2001, Bruce took the stage with his acoustic guitar, and together with Soozie Tyrell on violin and Patti Scialfa on backing vocals, they played a sad but achingly beautiful cover of “Something.”</p>

<p>It was a beautiful arrangement, one that captured the emotion of both the song and the moment. And it was only a moment, because Bruce immediately segued into a more upbeat cover of Harrison’s “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/11/25/cover-me-my-sweet-lord/">My Sweet Lord</a>” before diving into a festive holiday set list for the rest of the evening.</p>
<p>To this day, it remains the only time Bruce has covered “Something” in concert.</p>
