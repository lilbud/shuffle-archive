On its first release, &#8220;The Harder They Come&#8221; was backed with &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/07/28/cover-me-many-rivers-to-cross/\">Many Rivers to Cross</a>,&#8221; which Bruce performed regularly on World Tour 1993. On re-release, the single was backed by Cliff&#8217;s &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/08/05/roll-of-the-dice-cover-me-trapped/\">Trapped</a>,&#8221; which has been a fan favorite at Bruce&#8217;s shows for almost four decades.</p>\n<p>Bruce did cover the A-side, though&#8211;once and once only, at a very special show.</p>\n<p>In 2012, Bruce keynoted the SxSW festival in Austin, and afterward he played a full concert at Moody Theater with the E Street Band and a stellar array of guest artists. One of Bruce&#8217;s guests that night was Jimmy Cliff himself, and the two artists kicked off their three-song mini-set with Bruce&#8217;s one and only performance of &#8220;The Harder They Come.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Fortunately, the venue was intimate enough that several filmers were able to preserve their performance for posterity.
