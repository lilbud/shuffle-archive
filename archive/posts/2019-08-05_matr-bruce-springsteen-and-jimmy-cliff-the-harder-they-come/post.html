The film’s soundtrack became an international success, raising the global profile of reggae music and establishing Cliff as a star.</p>

<p>“The Harder They Come” ranks squarely at #350 on Rolling Stone’s 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, and Cliff even performed it on <em>Saturday Night Live</em> during the show’s very first season–three years after the song was released.</p>
<p>Still, most Springsteen fans are probably more familiar with the song’s B-sides (both of them) than the A-side. On its first release, “The Harder They Come” was backed with “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/07/28/cover-me-many-rivers-to-cross/">Many Rivers to Cross</a>,” which Bruce performed regularly on World Tour 1993. On re-release, the single was backed by Cliff’s “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/08/05/roll-of-the-dice-cover-me-trapped/">Trapped</a>,” which has been a fan favorite at Bruce’s shows for almost four decades.</p>
<p>Bruce did cover the A-side, though–once and once only, at a very special show.</p>
<p>In 2012, Bruce keynoted the SxSW festival in Austin, and afterward he played a full concert at Moody Theater with the E Street Band and a stellar array of guest artists. One of Bruce’s guests that night was Jimmy Cliff himself, and the two artists kicked off their three-song mini-set with Bruce’s one and only performance of “The Harder They Come.”</p>
<p>Fortunately, the venue was intimate enough that several filmers were able to preserve their performance for posterity. Here’s one of the best ones.</p>
