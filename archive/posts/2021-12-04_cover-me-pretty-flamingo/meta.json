He&#8217;s left only with how she looks, what she wears, how she walks. And yet, somehow&#8230;</p>\n<p><em>If he just could&#8230; if she just would</em>&#8230;</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve all been in that moment at least once, and we can tell that Paul Jones has, too.

And yet&#8230;</p>\n<p><em>If he just could&#8230; if she just would&#8230;</em></p>\n<p>The universality of that feeling helped carry Manfred Mann&#8217;s single all the way to #1 in the U.K. in the spring of 1966. (It notched only as high as #29 in the U.S.) But it was that &#8220;Ha!&#8221; that Bruce Springsteen dialed into when he started covering it on the Born to Run Tour in 1975.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - PRETTY FLAMINGO 1975 (audio)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/B5Zw_6PLuQM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>From that very first performance in Houston, Bruce prefaced his cover of &#8220;Pretty Flamingo&#8221; with a shaggy dog story that would only grow in length, cast, color, and detail with every telling, eventually outsizing the song itself.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - PRETTY FLAMINGO 1976  (audio)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RiC3w8lzbJ0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>But no matter how ridiculously charming the detail&#8211;Clarence playing the saxophone while riding a bike in short pants, Bruce shaking his maracas on a street corner as the girl walks by&#8211;the entire story is just Bruce&#8217;s equivalent of Paul Jones&#8217; fleeting &#8220;Ha!&#8221;, and Bruce milks it for minutes in order to allow himself a few minutes of pure, unbridled, unapologetic romance with the song itself.</p>\n<p>You can&#8217;t listen to Bruce Springsteen sing &#8220;Pretty Flamingo&#8221; and not instantly recall that glorious moment of instant infatuation, no matter how long ago it might have been. (His 2008 single, &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/02/17/roll-of-the-dice-girls-in-their-summer-clothes/\">Girls in Their Summer Clothes</a>&#8221; features essentially the same narrator from &#8220;Pretty Flamingo&#8221; forty years on.)</p>\n<p>As Bruce admitted during what is probably my favorite single &#8220;Pretty Flamingo&#8221; performance (from his 2014 High Hopes Tour), we&#8217;ve all lived that story at some point, and in that moment it&#8217;s the <em>only</em> story.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Pretty Flamingo - Bruce Springsteen Live (4/24/2014)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/L44FZ1_KB0k?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Bruce&#8217;s performance that night was almost a capella, with warm vocals imbued with nostalgia and emotional memory.
