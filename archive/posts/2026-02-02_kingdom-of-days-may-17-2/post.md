An amazing Wrecking Ball show in Barcelona, where the tour premieres (“Hungry Heart” and “You Can Look (But You Better Not Touch)” are the least of the highlights. This show will be remembered as the night when the legendary extended instrumental intro to “Prove It All Night” from the Darkness Tour finally returned–by request–after being absent for 32 years.

The first night of a jaw-dropping two-night closing stand for the High Hopes Tour in an unusual venue: the Mohegan Sun Casino in Uncasville, Connecticut. The set list features an embarrassment of riches from the opening “Racing in the Street ’78” to the tour premiere of “The Price You Pay” and “Quarter to Three” to the closing “Thunder Road.” Little Steven makes his unannounced and triumphant return to the band for these last two shows.

tracks still dominate the set list as the European leg gathers steam, but there’s still plenty of room for tour premieres: “Fire,” “Murder Incorporated,” “Waitin’ on a Sunny Day” and a solo acoustic “This Hard Land” all make their debut in San Sebastian.
