There are several recordings of songs performed during Bruce&#8217;s Back Door residency, and the bootleg recordings aren&#8217;t definitively linked to particular shows. We can be certain that the two recordings we&#8217;re about to listen to hail from sometime in February 1972, though, and we can also be pretty sure that there were more performances of &#8220;All I Want to Do Is Dance&#8221; that weren&#8217;t captured at all.)</p>\n<p>Both surviving recordings are a bit distant, and it can be hard to make out Bruce&#8217;s lyrics at times. But that&#8217;s okay&#8211;Bruce&#8217;s lyrics from this era were often not very substantive, and that&#8217;s certainly true for &#8220;All I Want to Do Is Dance.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s take a listen, starting with this first performance. Of particular note here is the three-minute introductory interplay between Bruce on guitar and David Sancious on keys. It&#8217;s almost certainly improvised, and both artists dazzle in their duel.</p>\n<div id=\"v-I8DjdsIW-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='426' src='https://videopress.com/embed/I8DjdsIW?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>The other surviving performance is from the same month (perhaps earlier, perhaps later, but certainly only a few weeks apart at most). Disappointingly, the intro is shorter and Sancious-less; without the rocket boost provided by the earlier performance&#8217;s introduction, this performance is slower and more of a straight-up rocker.</p>\n<div id=\"v-9eBAYPhh-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='568' src='https://videopress.com/embed/9eBAYPhh?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>Comparing the two contemporaneous performances gives us a pretty good idea of how loose and improvisational those early shows were.</p>\n<p>As for Bruce&#8217;s lyrics, there&#8217;s not much to analyze here&#8211;this is Bruce in pop mode. Still, there a few early instances of what would shortly become early Springsteen trademarks: the internal rhymes, the alliteration, and of course the totemization of the guitar:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I been looking, I been searching, I been like a buzzard perching on a branch</em><br />\n<em>I been stopping, I been hopping, I been bopping, I been running out of gas</em><br />\n<em>Tonight I&#8217;m gonna go to the ranch</em><br />\n<em>And I&#8217;m looking for love, trying for sweet romance</em><br />\n<em>But I know what you&#8217;re gonna do</em><br />\n<em>Cause all I wanna do is dance</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well I been learning, I been burning, I been running on my midnight lamp</em><br />\n<em>I been escaping, I been aching, I&#8217;ve been scraping up to buy me an amp</em><br />\n<em>Well Friday night I go to the hop</em><br />\n<em>My feet they move so fast that they just can&#8217;t stop</em><br />\n<em>Child, what&#8217;ve I gotta do now, tell me</em><br />\n<em>Cause all I wanna do is dance with you</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Oh baby you know that I need you and I know that you need me</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;ll learn to play guitar for you, woman I&#8217;ll be a star for you</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well look out Mama, cause I&#8217;m taking over</em><br />\n<em>Oh step back kids, let the music roll you over</em><br />\n<em>I can do anything, anything that you wanna do</em><br />\n<em>That&#8217;s alright with me, girl</em><br />\n<em>Ah won&#8217;t you come on through and ??? wanna do</em><br />\n<em>Yeah, come on babe, let me see you ???</em></p>\n<p>Before long, Bruce would turn his attention to more serious subjects, but in 1971 and 1972, The Bruce Springsteen Band was often just focused on providing a good dance party. (Besides &#8220;All I Want to Do Is Dance,&#8221; the band&#8217;s repertoire also included Springsteen originals like &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/06/22/roll-of-the-dice-dance-dance-dance/\">Dance Dance Dance</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/08/12/roll-of-the-dice-when-you-dance/\">When You Dance</a>.&#8221;)</p>\n<p>If Bruce ever surprises us with an archive series document of one of these early shows, we&#8217;re in for a treat.</p>\n<p><strong>All I Want to Do Is Dance<br />\nNever recorded</strong><br />\n<strong>Never released</strong><br />\n<strong>First performed:</strong> February 4, 1972 (Richmond, VA)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> February 26, 1972 (Richmond, VA)</p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
