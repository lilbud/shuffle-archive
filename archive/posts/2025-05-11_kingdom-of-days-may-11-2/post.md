**2005:** One of the standout shows of the first leg of the Devils & Dust Tour. At the Rosemont Theater outside of Chicago, Bruce debuts "[Dream Baby Dream](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/04/02/cover-me-dream-baby-dream/)" (with slightly different lyrics and phrasing than the version it would soon morph into) and plays the banjo for the first time (on "I'm on Fire"). During "[Land of Hope and Dreams,](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/01/05/roll-of-the-dice-land-of-hope-and-dreams/)" Bruce breaks a guitar string and continues a capella without missing a beat until Kevin Buell restrings the guitar in the nick of time–a truly remarkable performance.
