His lover keeps their secret but visits his grave in the dark of night, cloaked in a long black veil.</p>\n<p>It was a story destined for a folk song immortalization, and Frizzell&#8217;s original (which peaked at #6 on the Billboard Hot Country and Western chart) has been covered countless times, most notably by The Band (who recorded it on their debut album and performed it at Woodstock), Sammi Smith (who scored a Top 40 Country hit with it in 1974), and of course, the memorable television performance by Johnny Cash and Joni Mitchell on the very first episode of <em>The Johnny Cash Show</em> in 1969.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Joni Mitchell &amp; Johnny Cash - Long Black Veil\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Mf0lzBOSZ4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Bruce worked up a full-band arrangement of &#8220;Long Black Veil&#8221; before the Seeger Session Tour even began. At the final rehearsal show, four days before the tour officially opened at the New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival, Bruce and the Sessions Band took the stage and opened with Frizzell&#8217;s classic.</p>\n<p>While the song didn&#8217;t make Bruce&#8217;s Jazz Fest set, he debuted it a week later in London, early in the tour&#8217;s first European leg. &#8220;Long Black Veil&#8221; would go on to make a total of ten appearances that year, each one a showcase for the spectacular vocal and musical talent arrayed across the stage.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s Bruce&#8217;s final performance of &#8220;Long Black Veil&#8221; to date, live in Rome late in the Seeger Sessions Tour.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen with The SSB - Long Black Veil\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EiZ8ztIIZjs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><strong>Long Black Veil<br />\nFirst performed:</strong> April 26, 2006 (Asbury Park, NJ)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> October 10, 2006 (Rome, Italy)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>Lefty Frizzell&#8217;s 1959 tale of a falsely accused man who accepts his sentence rather than confess his secret was a natural temptation for a Bruce Springsteen cover treatment.
