**2012:** On Night Two in Dublin on the Wrecking Ball Tour, an injured Jake Clemons takes the stage in a wheelchair. He threw his back out the night before, and Bruce gently (and very cleverly) teases him during “[Spirit in the Night](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/03/01/roll-of-the-dice-spirit-in-the-night/).”

**2013:** The Wrecking Ball Tour comes to Cork, where “[Wild Thing](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/03/10/cover-me-wild-thing/),” “[The Price You Pay](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/09/23/roll-of-the-dice-the-price-you-pay/)” and “[Real World](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/07/25/roll-of-the-dice-real-world/)” make their tour debuts. This is the first time Bruce performs “Real World” since 2005, and early arriving fans get to hear it twice: once in the main set and once in a three-song pre-show.

**2015:** At what point does a guest appearance become a surprise co-headline? I’m not sure, but at Joe Grushecky’s show at The Wonder Bar, Bruce clearly crossed that line, joining the Houserockers for fifteen of their eighteen-song set.

**2018:** Netflix films a special invitation-only performance of *Springsteen on Broadway* at the Walter Kerr Theater in New York City. The show features two special encores (“[The Ghost of Tom Joad](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/10/17/roll-of-the-dice-the-ghost-of-tom-joad/)” and “[Long Time Comin’](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/06/19/roll-of-the-dice-long-time-comin/)“) and will be released on the streaming service (and on album) to much acclaim later in the year.
