On September 25, 2009, Elvis Costello invited Bruce to join him for an episode of his *Spectacle* television series. Bruce accepted, and the result was a session so chock full of great stories and performances that it spanned not one but two complete episodes.

[Those episodes](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/09/25/kingdom-of-days-september-25/) are essential viewing for either Elvis or Bruce fans, but one of the evening’s strongest performances was never aired or released: While the camera operators were setting up for the evening, Elvis led his band through a fantastic and furious performance of “[Point Blank](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/12/19/roll-of-the-dice-point-blank/).”

Elvis’ cover (Bruce had yet to take the stage) was just as intense and impassioned as Bruce’s own best performances of the song. Take a listen below and hear for yourself.
