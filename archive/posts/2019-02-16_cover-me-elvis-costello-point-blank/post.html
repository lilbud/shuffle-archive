<p>On September 25, 2009, Elvis Costello invited Bruce to join him for an episode of his <em>Spectacle </em> television series. Bruce accepted, and the result was a session so chock full of great stories and performances that it spanned not one but two complete episodes.</p>
<p><a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/09/25/kingdom-of-days-september-25/">Those episodes</a> are essential viewing for either Elvis or Bruce fans, but one of the evening’s strongest performances was never aired or released: While the camera operators were setting up for the evening, Elvis led his band through a fantastic and furious performance of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/12/19/roll-of-the-dice-point-blank/">Point Blank</a>.”</p>
