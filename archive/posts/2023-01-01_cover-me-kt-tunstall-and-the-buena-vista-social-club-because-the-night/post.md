There are a of “Because the Night” covers out there, but this is one of my favorites–and it comes from a most unexpected pairing.

*lot*

In 2009, The Buena Vista Social Club released their second album in their series, in which they reinvent classic pop and rock songs by teaming up with US, UK, and Irish vocalists and backing them with a Cuban-infused instrumental track–all to raise funds and awareness for climate change and disaster relief.

*Rhythm del Mundo*

For “Because the Night,” they chose Scottish singer-songwriter KT Tunstall, and together, Tunstall and the BVSC found a Latin groove that highlights and enhances the sultriness of the lyrics (Patti Smith’s version, I should note) more than even Bruce’s original arrangement.
