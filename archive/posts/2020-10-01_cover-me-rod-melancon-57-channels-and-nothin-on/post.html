<p>For anyone who thinks “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/05/17/roll-of-the-dice-57-channels-and-nothin-on/">57 Channels (And Nothin’ On)</a>” sizzles on vinyl but fizzled on stage, <em>this</em> is how you capture the dystopian alienation of Bruce’s original without distorting it into the production number it became during Bruce’s 1992-1993 tour. Courtesy of Red Melancon and his band:</p>

<p>Melancon did more than just cover “57 Channels” live–he released it on his latest album, <em>Pinkville</em>, as well.</p>

<p><em>Pinkville</em> is a strong collection of gritty southern rock, featuring a collection of original songs dark and twisted enough to sound like an electric <em>Nebraska</em>.</p>
<p>Rod’s cover of “57 Channels (An Nothin’ On)” fits so seamlessly on the album that it makes you realize just how at home the original would have been on <em>Nebraska</em> as well, in a different arrangement.</p>
