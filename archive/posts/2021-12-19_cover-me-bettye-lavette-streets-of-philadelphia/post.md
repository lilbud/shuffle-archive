Wow.

Just… wow.

I’ve been familiar with Bettye LaVette’s incredibly powerful cover of Bruce’s elegiac “” since it was released on the outstanding triple CD collection back in 2007. (Thank you, Janet Reno!)

But as I searched for the video to include with this post, I came across a live performance from December 2017, and like I said… wow.

LaVette absolutely Bruce’s award-winning song, both on stage and in the studio.

*owns*

The live video is the more powerful of the two, but the studio version benefits from a fuller sound and the addition of a subtle bass:

I honestly don’t know which version I prefer, but both mesmerize me.

These are performances that will stick with you long after you first listen.
