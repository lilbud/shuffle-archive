Sting celebrated his 60th birthday in 2011 by throwing himself a party at the Beacon Theater in New York City (a benefit for the Rainforest Fund). Bruce was in attendance to celebrate his old friend, and he paid tribute by covering Sting’s classic, “Fields of Gold.”

Bruce gave a lovely performance, but it’s hard to top the original.
