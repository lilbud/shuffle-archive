Shhh…. I’ll let you in on a secret, but you can’t tell anyone.

*Cover Me* is my favorite.

I know, I know. Parents aren’t supposed to have favorites, so please don’t tell the others. But while I’m most proud of *Roll of the Dice*, and even though *Kingdom of Days* is the most popular, *Cover Me* was the most delightful blog series to write.

It didn’t start out that way, though. For the first few months, it was almost an afterthought.

I was determined to work my way through every song Bruce Springsteen had written, performed, gifted, etc. and that included a ton of covers. I knew there would be some that warranted close attention and analysis, but others… well, I thought if I could at least catalog Bruce’s cover performances and compare them with the original, I’d have some kind of reference site like I hoped *Kingdom of Days* would become.

When I reviewed the hundreds of *Cover Me* entries to select the ones for this inaugural volume, I couldn’t help cringing at some of the earliest entries. They’re not worth collecting in print, and if I ever decide to, I’ll likely re-write them first. Even a couple of the early essays I did include in these pages are formulaic in a way I would thankfully soon abandon.

It was inevitable that I’d eventually start investing my *Cover Me* subjects with the same research effort I was putting into *Roll of the Dice* and *Kingdom of Days*. I can’t help it: I’m a historian. When I encounter a historical artifact, I want to learn more about it.

I’m not sure exactly when the inflection point was, but whenever it was, it almost certainly coincided with my discovery of Andrew Hickey’s brand new (at the time) podcast series, *A History of Rock Music* *in 500 Songs*.

If you’re reading these words and are not familiar with Hickey’s work, please put this book down right now and go find it, subscribe, and nourish yourself with a unrivaled and unequaled body of rock and roll scholarship.

Wherever the bar had been previously set, it was immediately clear to me that Hickey had raised it so much higher–and way, way, *way* higher than I could ever hope to achieve.

I was (and still am) particularly impressed by Hickey’s ability to find a hook or an angle from which to approach a subject that made it more interesting to the listener than a more direct approach might have. I soon adopted his technique, and I think my essays become more engaging as a result.

I became more curious about the original artists I was less familiar with, and I started listening and researching with more depth and interest.

I found myself learning about and developing a greater appreciation for artists and songs I’d never given enough consideration to, and I can see it reflected in my writing starting in early 2019. I started looking forward to each new *Cover Me* “assignment” with excitement, knowing I would forevermore hear the original song with greater attention and deeper appreciation.

(Fun fact: To keep the blog fresh and unpredictable, I let a Google randomizer choose each next *Cover Me* assignment the same way I did for *Roll of the Dice.* There were exceptions, though, and the publication dates are often giveaways for them.)

Most of my favorite entries in this series are earmarked for future volumes, but I think there are some strong ones in these pages.

I’m particularly fond of “Detroit Medley.” It traverses a lot of back-and-forth musical history in three-and-a-half pages with an economy of language for which I’m not typically known. “Quarter to Three” is an example of where a little extra curiosity led me down a rabbit hole that ended up providing the essay with an unexpected hook. And “Jersey Girl” feels like a *Cover Me/Roll of the Dice* mash-up, which I believe is how I categorized it when I first published it.

A note about the QR codes throughout this book: I *highly* recommend scanning each one with your mobile device as you encounter them, because they bring this book to life in ways the text alone can’t. However, the video and audio links are hosted by a variety of channels and posters, so I can’t guarantee that every QR code will work as time goes on. In fact, I pretty much *can* guarantee that someday they won’t. Every year, I’ve had to repair around ten percent of the links, so that’s probably a pretty good benchmark for the “QR decay” over time. I hope you’re able to enjoy the full experience now, and that the essays hold up as good reading even when the media someday expires.

As with every volume in the *E Street Shuffle Bookshelf Collection*, I’m grateful beyond measure to Lori Pierce and Robyn Sherer. To call them my volunteer editors would imply that they offered their services to me, when in reality they simply started correcting and suggesting whether I liked it or not (I always did) and never stopped. My published work is stronger for their contributions. I’m sure they have both already compiled a list of typos and run-on sentences in this introduction.

I chose the “Encore!” theme for this first volume because I knew it would encompass some of Bruce’s most well-known and best-loved covers, because it provided an umbrella for including some lesser-known ones as well, and because it allowed me to choose a sampling from each of Bruce’s tours over the years. And also, because I just liked the irony of kicking of a series with an “encore.”

Future volumes will be themed as well, in a way that I hope makes them interesting tours through both music history and Bruce’s career. For now, though, I hope you enjoy this group of songs that thrilled us, galvanized us, or made us reflect as Bruce sent us home, ears ringing and feet aching, into the night.
