It&#8217;s a poppy, treacly, light-on-its-feet smile of a song that defies any attempts at analysis by dint of its unabashed\u00a0 newly-in-love lyrics.</p>\n<p>If we pay attention though, Bruce gives us just enough context clues to establish that the link to Sirk&#8217;s 1955 film is more than just titular.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I got a dollar in my pocket, there ain&#8217;t a cloud up above</em><br />\n<em>I got a picture in a locket that says baby I love you</em><br />\n<em>Well if you didn&#8217;t look then boys then fellas don&#8217;t go looking now</em><br />\n<em>Well here she comes a-walking, yeah all that heaven will allow</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Say hey there mister bouncer now all I wanna do is dance</em><br />\n<em>But I swear I left my wallet back home in my working pants</em><br />\n<em>C&#8217;mon Slim slip me in, man, I&#8217;ll make it up to you somehow</em><br />\n<em>I can&#8217;t be late I got a date with all that heaven will allow</em></p>\n<p>Our narrator has a dollar in his pocket&#8211;a modest sum signifying a man of modest means. Whatever other money he may have is in his working pants, a detail meant to paint him as a laborer like Hudson&#8217;s character in <em>All That Heaven Allows</em>.</p>\n<p>Bruce&#8217;s character is a bit more carefree, though. He&#8217;s in love, and while there&#8217;s nothing explicitly stated in Bruce&#8217;s lyrics that establishes his love interest in a higher social stratum, he certainly signals his awareness that the road ahead for them is not a smooth one:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Rain and storm and dark skies, well now they don&#8217;t mean a thing</em><br />\n<em>If you got a girl that loves you and who wants to wear your ring</em><br />\n<em>So c&#8217;mon Mister Trouble, we&#8217;ll make it through you somehow</em><br />\n<em>We&#8217;ll fill this house with all the love and all that heaven will allow</em></p>\n<p>If it was just the bridge&#8217;s reference to dark skies and Mister Trouble, we might assume that Bruce is simply referring to the inevitable travails that life throws any couple&#8217;s way, but the last verse takes a strange turn.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Now some may wanna die young, man, young and gloriously</em><br />\n<em>Get it straight now, mister, hey buddy that ain&#8217;t me</em><br />\n<em>&#8216;Cause I got something on my mind, yeah, that sets me straight and walking proud</em><br />\n<em>And I want all the time, yeah all that heaven will allow</em></p>\n<p>Bruce swiped that first couplet from his\u00a0<em>Darkness\u00a0</em>outtake &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/06/28/roll-of-the-dice-city-of-night/\">City of Night</a>.&#8221; He certainly could have written new lyrics if he&#8217;d wanted to, so we have to assume he raided his notebook for those specific lines for a reason.</p>\n<p>It might be another hat tip to the movie, as Hudson&#8217;s character faces mortal peril towards the film&#8217;s conclusion. (No spoilers!) More likely, though, it&#8217;s a deliberate page turn from Bruce&#8217;s earlier live-hard, drive-fast, take-your-stand songwriting to a more mature protagonist who leaves that life behind and looks forward to a life of love and companionship.</p>\n<p>Musically, &#8220;All That Heaven Will Allow&#8221; is a solo number. With the exception of Max Weinberg on drums (although it sounds more like he&#8217;s playing the drumsticks), Bruce plays every instrument on the track. In concert, though, the feel-good song came alive in a full-band arrangement that stretched more than ten minutes, although most of that time belonged to a charming scene between Bruce and the Big Man (who gets some fine solo time), and a brief snippet of &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/06/28/roll-of-the-dice-city-of-night/\">Here She Comes Walking.</a>&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"All That Heaven Will Allow  (Bruce Springsteen)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kerAh8FGtvQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;All That Heaven Will Allow&#8221; was a nightly staple throughout the Tunnel of Love Tour but promptly disappeared when the tour ended, save for a unique Asbury Park cameo in 1996, when Bruce performed it acoustically accompanied only by Soozie Tyrell on violin and Richard Blackwell on percussion.
