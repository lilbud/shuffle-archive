<p>Start spreading the news: I’m leaving today!</p>
<p>Actually, that’s not true. I left last night, and by the time you read this, I’ll have landed at JFK and am probably in an Uber headed toward New York, New York.</p>
<p>You know, The Big Apple. The City That Never Sleeps. The City So Nice They Named It Twice.</p>
<p>I’m talking about the city immortalized by the song named after it, from the movie named after it.</p>

<p>“New York, New York” was originally performed by Liza Minelli in Martin Scorsese’s film by the same name. Minelli’s original version never became a hit–it peaked at only #104 upon its release in 1977–but her live performances became legendary, like this one from 1986.</p>

<p>Still, it took The Chairman of the Board to make a hit single out of “New York, New York.” Frank Sinatra scored his last-ever Top 40 hit with it when his studio recording peaked at #32 in 1980.</p>

<p>It didn’t take long for “New York, New York” to establish itself as an unofficial theme song for the city, a fact tacitly acknowledged by Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band when they played New York’s Madison Square Garden on the Tunnel of Love Tour in 1988.</p>
<p>At the first two of a five-show stand, the E Street Band played Bruce off stage at the end of the night with a brief instrumental coda of “New York, New York.”</p>

<p>Okay, maybe that was too short to count as a true cover, but there was also the time that Bruce joined Sinatra himself at a tribute concert in 1995, in what may very well be Bruce’s stiffest, most awkward television appearance ever.</p>

<p>Okay, maybe that doesn’t really count as a cover either. I’m not even certain Bruce sings at any point during that performance. I don’t know <em>what</em> he was doing exactly, and I’m not sure Bruce knew either.</p>
<p>But none of that matters, because if you haven’t figured it out by now, this whole article is just a pretext because <span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>I’m seeing Springsteen on Broadway tonight!</strong></span></p>
<p>I’m excited to hear <em>any</em> live music again after a year-and-a-half, let alone an up-close-and-personal performance by Bruce.</p>
<p>I’m way too excited to blog coherently, so instead of an analytical roll of the dice or a trip through rock and roll history, today you just get my fanboy babbling.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for my report from Re-Opening Night coming on Monday, though… pretty sure I can collect myself by then.</p>
<p>I think.</p>
