Steel Mill was many things, but a dance band wasn&#8217;t one of them.</p>\n<p>Steel Mill was, however, a pretty darn impressive jam band, which is why any individual song performance (&#8220;Dancing in the Street&#8221; included) could easily and often did stretch well beyond ten minutes.</p>\n<p>Shortly after that parking deck performance, Bruce invited local singer Robbin Thompson to join the band as a co-vocalist. Steel Mill would only last a few more months, though, and during those final gigs, the band would often mash up &#8220;Dancing in the Street&#8221; with\u00a0 &#8220;Honky Tonk Women&#8221; and &#8220;Proud Mary.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In the clips below (much clearer than the one above), you&#8217;ll hear Bruce and Robbin trading lead vocals in an almost thirteen-minute epic jam, featuring some terrific (but not very danceable) lead guitar by Bruce.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen and Steel Mill: Dancing in the Street with Honky Tonk Women 1971 South Amboy, NJ\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ChmsOg816d0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-20932-2\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/01-Dancin_-In-The-Street.mp3?_=2\" /><a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/01-Dancin_-In-The-Street.mp3\">https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/01-Dancin_-In-The-Street.mp3</a></audio>\n<p>When Steel Mill folded in January 1971, &#8220;Dancing in the Street&#8221; vanished from Bruce&#8217;s set lists as well.</p>\n<p>Well, <em>almost</em> completely.
