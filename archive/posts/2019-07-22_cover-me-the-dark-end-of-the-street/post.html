<p>Every once in a while, a fan brings a seriously great request sign to a show. One that would never even occur to me to ask for, but one that makes me immediately think “oooooh yeah, that’s a great choice.”</p>
<p>One of my favorite examples is the fan who requested James Carr’s “The Dark End of the Street” in (of all places) Tampere, Finland, on June 2, 2009.</p>
<p>“The Dark End of the Street” is (as co-songwriter Dan Penn confessed was his aspiration) “the best cheatin’ song. Ever.” I’ve also always believed it to be an inspiration for Bruce’s own “Hearts of Stone.”</p>

<p>Carr’s original 1966 recording was a hit, peaking at #10 on Billboard’s Black Singles chart, and #77 on the Pop chart.</p>
<p>But it was Clarence Carter’s 1969 version that lodged itself in Bruce’s memory, primarily because of Carter’s spoken introduction (far longer than the song itself) that any fan who’s seen Bruce perform “<a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/11/10/roll-of-the-dice-back-in-your-arms/">Back in Your Arms</a>” live will immediately recognize as an inspiration.</p>

<p>Bruce referenced that speech when he honored that request in Tampere, pausing mid-song to pay homage to Carter with a story of his own.</p>
<p>Bruce acknowledged the song’s theme as one he was personally very familiar with… but not for many, many, <em>many </em> years. Take a listen below.</p>

<p>Bruce’s soulful performance that day was perfectly suited for both his vocal and patter style; serious kudos to the fan who requested it.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> Although several fans recorded snippets of the song, it doesn’t seem like anyone caught the full song. Here’s the closest thing to a complete version–it’s only missing the first minute or so, and it includes the entire Carter-esque story.</p>
