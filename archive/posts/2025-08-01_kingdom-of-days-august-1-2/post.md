**1976:** A big night in Red Bank: unable to record due to Mike Appel’s legal injunction, Bruce prepares for what will come to be known as “The Lawsuit Tour” with a week of shows (six days out of seven) at the Monmouth Arts Center. This show features the debut of The Miami Horns, borrowed for this tour from Southside Johnny. Because Bruce is unable to go into the studio, he works out new material on-stage as the tour progresses, starting with this show: “[Rendezvous](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/05/08/roll-of-the-dice-rendezvous/)” is played for the very first time, as is an early work-in-progress version of “[Something in the Night](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/05/28/roll-of-the-dice-something-in-the-night/).” Bruce also covers “[You Can’t Sit Down](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/06/21/cover-me-you-cant-sit-down/)” for the first time, as well as a one-time-only “[She’s Sure the Girl I Love](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/08/27/cover-me-shes-sure-the-girl-i-love/).” Whew!
