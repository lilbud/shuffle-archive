Bring it on, Bruce&#8211;what are we getting? A brand-new unreleased song? A cool tribute cover? A missing-in-action classic, perhaps?</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s what I imagine was going through the minds of Bruce&#8217;s Swedish audience that night of June 17, 1992. But what they got was the world premiere of a serious contender for Bruce Springsteen&#8217;s worst song ever:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Real Man Bruce Springsteen June 17, 1992 Stockholm, Sweeden\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/70nhL9xEvw8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>I cringe every time I watch that clip. Bruce tries <em>so</em> hard to sell the song, delivering an over-the-top performance for a song that started out that way.</p>\n<p>As for the studio track, <em>Ultimate Classic Rock</em> called it &#8220;an embarrassment.&#8221; <em>Rolling Stone</em> cited it as one of 22 Terrible Songs by Great Artists. When Backstreets.com wanted to punk readers on April Fools Day a couple of years back, they announced a promotional release of &#8220;the legendary &#8216;Real Man&#8217; single, initially planned as a U.S. follow-up to the &#8216;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/05/17/roll-of-the-dice-57-channels-and-nothin-on/\">57 Channels (And Nothin&#8217; On)</a>&#8216; single in 1992 but never released.&#8221;</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s how dismissively &#8220;Real Man&#8221; is considered by most critics and fans, to the degree it&#8217;s considered at all. (As for me, I&#8217;d rank it third from the bottom, just above &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/08/09/roll-of-the-dice-ill-stand-by-you-always/\">I&#8217;ll Stand By You</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/01/13/roll-of-the-dice-cover-me/\">Cover Me</a>.&#8221;)</p>\n<p>But we must ask ourselves: does &#8220;Real Man&#8221; really deserve all that scorn? Let&#8217;s do the right thing and take a close listen with an open mind:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Real Man (Audio)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LRH2Z8Ixy5Q?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Oh yeah, that track sucks.</p>\n<p>What a waste of some serious talent. (That&#8217;s David Sancious playing the organ and Randy Jackson on bass, although I suspect they might both prefer that information to stay under the radar.)</p>\n<p>As for the lyrics, well even Bruce felt the need to issue a disclaimer before performing it each night: &#8220;This next song is a very corny song, so corny I almost threw it off the damn record&#8230; but uh, but I guess I&#8217;m gonna do it here tonight.&#8221;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Took my baby to a picture show</em><br />\n<em>Found a seat in the back row</em><br />\n<em>Sound came up, lights went down</em><br />\n<em>And Rambo he was blowing &#8217;em down</em><br />\n<em>I don&#8217;t need no gun in my fist baby</em><br />\n<em>All I need is your sweet kiss</em><br />\n<em>To get me feeling like a real man</em></p>\n<p>You know, one would think that Bruce would have learned after &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/09/18/roll-of-the-dice-im-a-rocker/\">I&#8217;m a Rocker</a>&#8221; that pop culture references rarely age well.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Feeling like a real man</em><br />\n<em>Well you can beat on your chest</em><br />\n<em>Hell any monkey can</em><br />\n<em>But you got me feeling like a real man</em><br />\n<em>Oh feeling like a real man</em></p>\n<p>As choruses go, this one&#8217;s pretty, um, primitive&#8211;maybe a cut above &#8220;Ooh ooh I got a crush on you.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Speaking of &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/02/02/roll-of-the-dice-crush-on-you/\">Crush on You</a>,&#8221; if our first exposure to the next two verses was on paper without the music playing, we might wonder if they were deleted scenes from it&#8211;they have virtually the same cadence and construction.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Me and my girl Saturday night</em><br />\n<em>It&#8217;s a late movie on Channel Five</em><br />\n<em>The girls were dropping, they&#8217;re dropping like flies</em><br />\n<em>To some smooth-talking cool-walking private eye</em><br />\n<em>I ain&#8217;t got no nerves of steel</em><br />\n<em>But all I got to know is if your love is real</em><br />\n<em>To get me feeling like a real man</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well now I ain&#8217;t no fighter that&#8217;s easy to see</em><br />\n<em>And as a lover I ain&#8217;t going down in history</em><br />\n<em>But when the lights go down and you pull me close</em><br />\n<em>Well I look in your eyes and there&#8217;s one thing I know</em><br />\n<em>Baby I&#8217;ll be tough enough</em><br />\n<em>If I can find the guts to give you all my love</em><br />\n<em>Then I&#8217;ll be feeling like a real man</em></p>\n<p>In fact, the similarities don&#8217;t stop there. Both &#8220;Crush on You&#8221; and &#8220;Real Man&#8221; contain dated pop culture references, and they both have <em>super-</em>corny lyrics. So why does one work while the other one doesn&#8217;t?</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll argue that it&#8217;s the arrangement and the production. Yes, &#8220;Crush on You&#8221; is as corny as they come, but the arrangement crunches and rocks&#8211;it&#8217;s aggressive, almost dangerous.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Real Man&#8221; on the other hand&#8230; well, let&#8217;s just say there&#8217;s nothing dangerous about that track. The backing track suits the lyrics to a tee, and in this case that is <em>not</em> a good thing.</p>\n<p>Now I know I&#8217;ve been hating on &#8220;Real Man&#8221; throughout this post, so let me end by saying two things in its defense:</p>\n<p>First, Bruce wrote it when he had finally found real love, happiness, and satisfaction. If you write what you know, that&#8217;s what&#8217;s going to come out in song. Over time, I think Bruce learned how to write happy songs without tipping over into diabetic territory, but in 1990 just being happy and satisfied was a new experience for Bruce.</p>\n<p>So when I hear &#8220;Real Man&#8221; I hear my hero&#8211;a man who has battled against depression his entire adult life&#8211;absolutely joyful and giddy. I may not like the song, but I love knowing that he felt the way he did when he wrote it.</p>\n<p>Second: I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m writing these words, but I&#8217;d actually kinda like to see Bruce try a harder arrangement of &#8220;Real Man&#8221; in concert some time. (He hasn&#8217;t touched it in 28 years.) It may never be a great song, but I suspect there&#8217;s campy potential a la &#8220;Crush on You&#8221; if he can figure out the right way to unlock it.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d recommend starting by ditching those synths.</p>\n<p><strong>Real Man<br />\nRecorded:</strong> January-February 1990<br />\n<strong>Released:\u00a0</strong><em>Human Touch\u00a0</em>(1992)<br />\n<strong>First performed:</strong> June 17, 1992 (Stockholm, Sweden)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> July 25, 1992 (East Rutherford, NJ)</p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
