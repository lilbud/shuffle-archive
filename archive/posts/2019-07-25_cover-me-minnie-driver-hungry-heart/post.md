She’s much better known as an actress, but Minnie Driver’s also a singer-songwriter with three albums under her belt.

Minnie released her first album, *Everything I’ve Got in My Pocket,* in 2004. Accompanying the ten original compositions on that album is a lovely cover of Bruce’s “[Hungry Heart.](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/12/21/roll-of-the-dice-hungry-heart/)”

The arrangement is lovely: all slow, soft piano and drum brush. I can’t honestly say it suits the lyrics, but then again, neither does Bruce’s original arrangement, so no stones thrown from where I sit.

Take a listen below.
