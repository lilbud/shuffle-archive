<p>Minnie released her first album, <em>Everything I’ve Got in My Pocket,</em> in 2004. Accompanying the ten original compositions on that album is a lovely cover of Bruce’s “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/12/21/roll-of-the-dice-hungry-heart/">Hungry Heart.</a>”</p>
<p>The arrangement is lovely: all slow, soft piano and drum brush. I can’t honestly say it suits the lyrics, but then again, neither does Bruce’s original arrangement, so no stones thrown from where I sit.</p>
<p>Take a listen below.</p>
