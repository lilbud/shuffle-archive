<p>I try to steer clear of current events on this blog, even Bruce-related ones–the vault of past treasures is deep enough to keep me busy for years.</p>
<p>But I’m a sucker for a good cover of an obscure Bruce song, and this one from three weeks ago is as obscure as it gets:</p>
<p>Never released, never performed: Bruce Springsteen’s “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/09/12/roll-of-the-dice-unsatisfied-heart/">Unsatisfied Heart</a>,” performed in San Diego by The War on Drugs on April 15, 2018. Looks like they know where to find the great bootlegs!</p>
