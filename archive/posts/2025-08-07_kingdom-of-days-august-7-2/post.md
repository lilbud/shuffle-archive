**2002:** The Rising Tour officially kicks off and Soozie Tyrell makes her official E Street Band debut at the Continental Airlines Arena in East Rutherford, with essentially the same set as the rehearsal show in the same venue. Early shows on the "barnstorming" leg would be atypically rigid, with little variation from night to night.
