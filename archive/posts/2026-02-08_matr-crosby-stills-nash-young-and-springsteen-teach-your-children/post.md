One time only: At Neil Young’s inaugural Bridge School Benefit in 1986, Bruce joined Crosby, Still, Nash and Young for a beautifully loose rendition of “Teach Your Children.”

Don Henley, Tom Petty, and Robin Williams(!) join in as well, and while Danny and Nils are only visible for a moment, you can hear them throughout.

The original, of course, can’t be topped. In his autobiography, Graham Nash recalled:

*The origin of the song came from my recent infatuation with art. I had begun collecting photographs around that time, powerful images that had an emotional effect on me. One, in particular, was a Diane Arbus image of a boy in Central Park. It spoke volumes to me. The kid was only about nine or ten years old, but his expression bristled with intense anger. He had a plastic grenade clenched in a fist, but it seemed to me that if it were real the kid would have thrown it. The consequences it implied startled me. I thought, “If we don’t start teaching our kids a better way of dealing with each other, humanity will never succeed.”*

Although first written it while Nash was a member of The Hollies, it was Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young who first recorded and charted with it in 1970. It only reached #16 on the Billboard Hot 100, but it’s remained a timeless classic thanks to its important message.

35 years later, Bruce reprised “Teach Your Children” with Steve Earle, Willie Nile, and Rosanne Cash at Earle’s benefit show in New Yor City.
