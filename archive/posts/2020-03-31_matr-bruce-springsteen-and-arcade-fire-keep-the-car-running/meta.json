Art does allow you to do that, to go right up to the abyss and look in, hopefully without falling in. On any given day. I feel like that\u2019s what <strong>Arcade Fire</strong> was built to hold off, that falling in. There\u2019s a furious aspect to the performance, and that\u2019s why people come out \u2014 you\u2019re recognizing the realities of people\u2019s emotional lives and their difficulties, you\u2019re presenting these problems, and you\u2019re bringing a survival kit. The bands that do that forge intense, intense relationships with their audience, and to me, that was always the core of the best rock\u2019n\u2019roll.&#8221;\u00a0 <em>&#8211;Bruce Springsteen to Steve Kandell, Spin, December 2007</em></span></p></blockquote>\n<p>Bruce lavished that praise on Arcade Fire in the presence of the band&#8217;s lead vocalists, Win Butler and R\u00e9gine Chassagne, just hours before Bruce&#8217;s Magic show at the Meadowlands in early October 2007.</p>\n<p>Just days later, Win and R\u00e9gine would join Bruce and the E Street Band on stage in Ottawa for two songs. First they played &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/12/22/roll-of-the-dice-state-trooper/\">State Trooper</a>,&#8221; an obvious choice, given that Arcade Fire had covered it in concert several times by that point.</p>\n<p>But as we can tell from the pull quote at the top of the article, Bruce is too much of an Arcade Fire fan not to play one of their songs, too&#8211;and that one turned to be an obvious choice also.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Keep the Car Running&#8221; (a Springsteenian title if ever there was one) was the second single off of the band&#8217;s second album,\u00a0<em>Neon Bible</em>. It peaked at #32 on the Billboard Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart, and\u00a0<em>Rolling Stone\u00a0</em>ranked it as the 22nd best song of 2007.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Keep the Car Running\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jvrp2bM4FpE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Featuring an automobile theme, a driving backing track, and\u00a0<em>Nebraska-</em>esque lyrics, &#8220;Keep the Car Running&#8221; invited countless comparisons of the two bands, which didn&#8217;t seem to faze either of them. Bruce and Win both considered the other as an influence, and both were eager to gush about it when given the chance.</p>\n<p>And yet, that early Magic Tour appearance in Ottawa was the first time the two men played together, so it was an open question how well the Arcade Fire sound would translate to the E Street stage.</p>\n<p>As it turned out, it translated pretty darn well. See for yourself: the clip below isn&#8217;t the best quality, but it&#8217;s more than watchable, and it&#8217;s easy to feel the energy of the combined band and avid fans feeding off each other.</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsukSiGcUng</p>\n<p>Bruce would perform with Win and R\u00e9gine once more, five years down the road, but that 2007 night in Ottawa remains the only time to date Bruce has played &#8220;Keep the Car Running.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Keep the Car Running<br />\nFirst performed:</strong> October 14, 2007 (Ottawa, ON)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> October 14, 2007 (Ottawa, ON)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>One time only: Win Butler and R\u00e9gine Chassagne join Bruce on stage in Ottawa for one of Arcade Fire&#8217;s greatest hits.</p>\n", "protected": false}, "author": 1, "featured_media": 17328, "comment_status": "open", "ping_status": "open", "sticky": false, "template": "", "format": "standard", "meta": {"_monsterinsights_skip_tracking": false, "_monsterinsights_sitenote_active": false, "_monsterinsights_sitenote_note": "", "_monsterinsights_sitenote_category": 0, "jetpack_post_was_ever_published": false, "_jetpack_newsletter_access": "", "_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs": false, "_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id": 0, "_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content": false, "_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content": false, "footnotes": "", "jetpack_publicize_message": "", "jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled": true, "jetpack_social_post_already_shared": true, "jetpack_social_options": {"image_generator_settings": {"template": "highway", "default_image_id": 0, "font": "", "enabled": false}, "version": 2}}, "categories": [4, 5], "tags": [1689, 1690], "class_list": ["post-17117", "post", "type-post", "status-publish", "format-standard", "has-post-thumbnail", "hentry", "category-cover-me", "category-meeting-across-the-river", "tag-arcade-fire", "tag-keep-the-car-running"], "aioseo_notices": [], "jetpack_publicize_connections": [], "jetpack_featured_media_url": "https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/keepcar.jpg?fit=1080%2C1080&ssl=1", "jetpack_sharing_enabled": true, "jetpack_shortlink": "https://wp.me/p9w3Lk-4s5", "jetpack_likes_enabled": true, "jetpack-related-posts": [{"id": 61113, "url": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2025/10/14/kingdom-of-days-october-14-2/", "url_meta": {"origin": 17117, "position": 0}, "title": "Kingdom of Days: October 14", "author": "Ken", "date": "October 14, 2025", "format": false, "excerpt": "On this date: Arcade Fire makes a memorable guest appearance, Bruce plays his first-ever show in Argentina, and the European Rising Tour kicks off.
