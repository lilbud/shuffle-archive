Fred the Bear is an alt-rock/country band out of Minnesota, but they've got a lot of New Jersey in them, too–their sets have featured several Springsteen covers (check out their YouTube page [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWj_8lNNjrqi3xTTrIM0WOg)).

One of the many, many bands to take to the Internet during the great pandemic of 2020, Fred the Bear recently offered up a new streaming performance of one of their best covers: Bruce's "[Atlantic City,](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/06/04/roll-of-the-dice-atlantic-city/)" performed acoustically on guitar, mandolin and upright bass.

The guys do a terrific job honoring the original *Nebraska* arrangement of "Atlantic City" while making it their own. I'll be keeping an eye out for future covers.
