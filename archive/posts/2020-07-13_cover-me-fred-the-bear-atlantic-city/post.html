<p>One of the many, many bands to take to the Internet during the great pandemic of 2020, Fred the Bear recently offered up a new streaming performance of one of their best covers: Bruce’s “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/06/04/roll-of-the-dice-atlantic-city/">Atlantic City,</a>” performed acoustically on guitar, mandolin and upright bass.</p>

<p>The guys do a terrific job honoring the original <em>Nebraska </em>arrangement of “Atlantic City” while making it their own. I’ll be keeping an eye out for future covers.</p>
