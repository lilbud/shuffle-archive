<p><strong>1973</strong>: Bruce (and the band that was still more than a year away from being known as “E Street”) drop by Boston’s WBCN-FM for an in-studio interview (Bruce’s very first) to promote their week-long gig at Paul’s Mall. The boys perform six songs, including the ultra-rare “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/05/18/roll-of-the-dice-bishop-danced/">Bishop Danced</a>” and “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/04/10/roll-of-the-dice-song-for-orphans/">Song for Orphans</a>.” They also perform an early version of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/03/14/roll-of-the-dice-wild-billys-circus-story/">Wild Billy’s Circus Story</a>,” which wouldn’t be recorded and released until later that year. Here it’s called simply “Circus Song.” The first half is in pretty final form; the second half, however, features some very different lyrics. Take a listen to the audio below–it’s the earliest known live recording of Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band.</p>

<p><strong>1980: </strong>Bruce Springsteen joins very young cover band Atlantic City Expressway on stage at The Fast Lane in Asbury Park. The band’s front man: seventeen-year-old Jon Bon Jovi. Jon is still two years from recording his first hit, three years from forming his own band, and four years from releasing his first album. Atlantic City Expressway is quite familiar with Bruce’s work–his songs often appeared on the band’s set lists. Tonight, Bruce and the band perform “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/07/04/roll-of-the-dice-the-promised-land/">The Promised Land</a>” together.</p>
