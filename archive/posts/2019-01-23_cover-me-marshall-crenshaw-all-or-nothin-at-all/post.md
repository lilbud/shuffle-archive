Dare I say it? Dare I do:

In my humble opinion, Marshall Crenshaw’s cover of “[All or Nothin’ at All](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/01/30/roll-of-the-dice-all-or-nothing-at-all/)” is stronger than Bruce’s tragically overlooked *Human Touch* track.

Crenshaw wisely hews closely to the album arrangement–it’s perfectly suited for his style–but if he doesn’t bring anything new to the table, he definitely brings his A-game. Turn it up!

You can find Crenshaw’s cover of “All or Nothin’ at All” on the Springsteen tribute album *One Step Up* or on the Crenshaw bootleg *B-Sides and Unreleased*.
