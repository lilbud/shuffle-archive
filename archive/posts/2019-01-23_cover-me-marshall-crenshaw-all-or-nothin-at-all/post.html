<p>Dare I say it? Dare I do:</p>
<p>In my humble opinion, Marshall Crenshaw’s cover of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/01/30/roll-of-the-dice-all-or-nothing-at-all/">All or Nothin’ at All</a>” is stronger than Bruce’s tragically overlooked <em>Human Touch </em>track.</p>
<p>Crenshaw wisely hews closely to the album arrangement–it’s perfectly suited for his style–but if he doesn’t bring anything new to the table, he definitely brings his A-game. Turn it up!</p>

<p>You can find Crenshaw’s cover of “All or Nothin’ at All” on the Springsteen tribute album <em>One Step Up</em> or on the Crenshaw bootleg <em>B-Sides and Unreleased</em>.</p>
