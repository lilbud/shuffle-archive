We’ve met Martin Ekman before. [His cover](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/08/12/cover-me-martin-ekman-and-daniel-falcone-borg-the-river/) of “[The River](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/03/04/roll-of-the-dice-the-river/)” with Daniel Falcone Borg was one of my personal favorites from our *Cover Me* spotlights last year

Martin’s quite the cover artist on his own, though. For the past year or so, he’s been on a mission to arrange and record 100 of his favorite songs, all performed entirely by himself on multiple instruments.

This week’s entry (#63) was another of Bruce’s songs, and as usual, it’s a wonderful interpretation.

Martin’s version of “[Secret Garden](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/05/30/roll-of-the-dice-secret-garden/)” starts out in a relatively faithful solo acoustic guitar arrangement, but by the end of the first verse he takes liberties with the melody and gently layers on instrumentation (including a subtle accordion that adds a nostalgic note to the song). The result is a beautiful and nuanced recording.
