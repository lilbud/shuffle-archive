<p>Martin’s quite the cover artist on his own, though. For the past year or so, he’s been on a mission to arrange and record 100 of his favorite songs, all performed entirely by himself on multiple instruments.</p>
<p>This week’s entry (#63) was another of Bruce’s songs, and as usual, it’s a wonderful interpretation.</p>

<p>Martin’s version of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/05/30/roll-of-the-dice-secret-garden/">Secret Garden</a>” starts out in a relatively faithful solo acoustic guitar arrangement, but by the end of the first verse he takes liberties with the melody and gently layers on instrumentation (including a subtle accordion that adds a nostalgic note to the song). The result is a beautiful and nuanced recording.</p>
