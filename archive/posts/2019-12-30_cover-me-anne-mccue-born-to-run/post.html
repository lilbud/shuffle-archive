<p>It’s <em>really</em> hard to cover “Born to Run.”</p>
<p>It’s Bruce’s signature song; the track is so painstakingly crafted and layered, and Bruce’s vocals are so passionate that “Born to Run” seems to stare anyone down who even considers covering it.</p>
<p>There are a few notable exceptions, of course: <a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/09/13/cover-me-roger-daltrey-born-to-run/">Roger Daltry</a> gave it his all, and <a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/03/16/cover-me-suzi-quatro-born-to-run/">Suzi Quatro</a> gave it even more than that.</p>
<p>But singer-songwriter Anne McCue took a different approach with her 2013 cover, eschewing the original’s frenetic energy and escapist drive and finding instead an Americana arrangement that would have been right at home on the Seeger Sessions Tour.</p>

<p>McCue’s version does exactly what a cover should: bring something new to the song while still adhering to its spirit and meaning. When McCue sings “Born to Run,” we don’t hear someone desperate to escape so much as we hear someone destined to always wander. There’s a hint of sadness in her performance, but mostly what I hear in her voice is acceptance–and it changes and breathes new life into Bruce’s song.</p>
<p>And that fiddle solo during the bridge–who would have thought that would work?</p>
<p>This is a fine, daring interpretation by a talented performer.</p>
