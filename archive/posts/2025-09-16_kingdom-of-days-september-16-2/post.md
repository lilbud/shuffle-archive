***New for 2025:** New entry for 1977, 1983, and 2002*

**1967:** The Castiles play two cover sets at the grand opening of The Left Foot, a short-lived teen club based in the rec center of St. Peter’s Episcopal Church in Freehold. One of the songs played tonight–a cover of Willie Dixon’s “[You Can’t Judge a Book by the Cover](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/12/02/cover-me-you-cant-judge-a-book-by-the-cover/)” will eventually become an official release on *Chapter and Verse* almost 50 years later. The set also includes covers of Jimi Hendrix’s “[Purple Haze](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/02/19/cover-me-purple-haze/)” and The Yardbirds’ “[Jeff’s Boogie](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/04/21/cover-me-jeffs-boogie/)” that showcases just how accomplished on the guitar Bruce had already become by age eighteen.

**1978:** Bruce and the E Street Band continue their three-night Darkness Tour stand at the Palladium in New York City. This show features the first full-band “[Independence Day](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/03/14/roll-of-the-dice-independence-day/),” a work-in-progress “[Point Blank,](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/12/19/roll-of-the-dice-point-blank/)” and the tour debut of “[Incident on 57th Street](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/12/14/roll-of-the-dice-incident-on-57th-street/)” — a pretty great combination for those lucky enough to be there. After the show, the band sits down for an interview with local WNEW DJ Vin Scelsa, which will be broadcast three days later.

**2002:** Bruce attends an Asbury Park memorial service for Mark McGarril and performs two songs on his acoustic guitar.

Jay Weinberg helms the drums for the entire show–the last time he’ll do that on this tour.

**2013:** While Bruce was in Buenos Aires for a show a few days earlier, he learned a Spanish language song that he’d intended to perform there: León Gieco’s “[Sólo le Pido a Dios](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/11/03/cover-me/).” He didn’t quite get it down in time, so instead he had himself filmed and uploads it to YouTube today.
