One of rock's greatest riffs was based on another one of rock's greatest riffs, and Bruce has played them both.

"[Little Queenie](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/12/11/cover-me-little-queenie/)" is the more common of the two (forever associated by fans with the infamous "bomb scare show" of 1975); Bruce's version of "Get It On" is a lot more obscure.

The original, of course, is well-known and instantly recognizable. T. Rex released it as a single in 1971, and it went all the way to #10 in the U.S. and to the top spot in the U.K.

Supergroup The Power Station covered it in 1985, and their version (slightly retitled) charted as well, outperforming the original in the U.S.

When Bruce tackled it for the one and only time, it was with a supergroup of sorts, too. On the night of October 21, 1994, Bruce joined an all-star line-up at The Playpen in Sayreville, New Jersey.

Together with John Eddie, Greg Kihn, Marshall Crenshaw, and Elliott Murphy, Bruce tackled an impromptu "Bang a Gong (Get It On)" before seguing seamlessly into "[(Get Your Kicks on) Route 66](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/08/15/cover-me-get-your-kicks-on-route-66/)." Listen to that one-time-only performance below.
