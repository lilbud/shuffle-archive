<p>“<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/12/11/cover-me-little-queenie/">Little Queenie</a>” is the more common of the two (forever associated by fans with the infamous “bomb scare show” of 1975); Bruce’s version of “Get It On” is a lot more obscure.</p>
<p>The original, of course, is well-known and instantly recognizable. T. Rex released it as a single in 1971, and it went all the way to #10 in the U.S. and to the top spot in the U.K.</p>

<p>Supergroup The Power Station covered it in 1985, and their version (slightly retitled) charted as well, outperforming the original in the U.S.</p>

<p>When Bruce tackled it for the one and only time, it was with a supergroup of sorts, too. On the night of October 21, 1994, Bruce joined an all-star line-up at The Playpen in Sayreville, New Jersey.</p>
<p>Together with John Eddie, Greg Kihn, Marshall Crenshaw, and Elliott Murphy, Bruce tackled an impromptu “Bang a Gong (Get It On)” before seguing seamlessly into “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/08/15/cover-me-get-your-kicks-on-route-66/">(Get Your Kicks on) Route 66</a>.” Listen to that one-time-only performance below.</p>
