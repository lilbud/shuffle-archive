<p>All three are masters at creating memorable songs for movies, but none of them could figure out how to write a song with rhymes for “Ghostbusters.”</p>
<p>Ray Parker Jr. was not the studio’s fourth choice. Heck, he wasn’t even their fiftieth choice.</p>
<p>But time was running out. Columbia’s destined-to-be-a-classic summer blockbuster was only days away from release, and it <em>still</em> didn’t have a title song.</p>
<p>Parker was a big name, but he was known for writing R&amp;B love songs, not motion picture theme songs. But he was in the rolodex of Columbia SVP Gary LeMel, who reached out in desperation with offer equally desperate: a $50,000 advance for two days’ work (that’s all the time that was left in the schedule), and Parker could keep the money even if the song was unusable.</p>
<p>Even so, Parker was reluctant. “[Ghostbusters]… that’s a really terrible word to try and sing,” he recalled in a recent interview. But the film’s director was insistent: the title needed to be in the song.</p>
<p>Parker took the job, and the studio gave him the movie’s montage scene (where the song was meant to play) temporarily backed with “I Want a New Drug” by Huey Lewis and the News, a decision that proved fateful.</p>

<p>Parker’s a-ha moment came just as time was running out. Forcing himself to stay awake on the final evening, he saw a late-night commercial for an exterminator that inspired the song’s classic call-and response tagline.</p>
<p>Parker was right: <em>Ghostbusters</em> is a terrible song to sing, let alone rhyme. His epiphany was realizing he didn’t have to do either.</p>
<p>Completing the song at the eleventh hour, he sent it off to the studio, and the rest is pop culture history (undoubtedly helped by a memorable music video packed with pop star cameos).</p>

<p>Huey Lewis was not amused, however. He noticed that Parker’s song had a <em>lot</em> of similarities to “I Want a New Drug” and filed suit.</p>

<p>Whether reasonable coincidence or not, the parties eventually settled out of court,</p>
<p>Lewis ended up with the movie song of the summer the following year, and Parker… well, “Who you gonna call?” became a global pop culture phrase still recognized to this day.</p>
<p>Which is why when Bruce Springsteen opened his Halloween 2024 show in Montreal with it, every fan in the arena immediately understood their assignment.</p>

<p>Bruce has been known to feature one-time-only performances in his Halloween shows. (There are a couple in this book, in fact.) But even so, “Ghostbusters” was a surprise–a fun one that kicked off a great show.</p>
