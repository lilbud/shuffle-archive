***New for 2025:** No updates*

**1975:** Bruce plays his first-ever show in Europe, a historic concert at the Hammersmith Odeon in London. The hype precedes him. Bruce famously reacts to it by tearing down posters that read “Finally, London is ready for Bruce Springsteen and The E Street Band,” but despite later reports that he considered the show itself to be substandard, for those there (and for those who hear and watch it decades later via an official release) the show is intense and electric.
