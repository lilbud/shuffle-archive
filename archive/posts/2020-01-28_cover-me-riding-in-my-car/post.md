Bruce Springsteen his covered the work of Woody Guthrie time and again.

"[This Land Is Your Land](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2023/07/04/cover-me-this-land-is-your-land/)" was a River Tour staple; "[Hard Times (Come Again No More)](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/01/21/cover-me-hard-times-come-again-no-more/)" was a featured encore throughout the Working on a Dream Tour.

Bruce has covered folk classics like "[Lonesome Valley](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/02/08/cover-me-woody-guthries-lonesome-valley/)" and "[Deportee (Plane Wreck at Los Gatos)](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/01/05/cover-me-deportee-plane-wreck-at-los-gatos/)" in concert, and he's released a studio recording of "[I Ain't Got No Home](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/02/10/cover-me-rotd-i-aint-got-no-home/)."

But as soon as Bruce became a parent, we knew it was only a matter of time before Guthrie's children's songs showed up in Bruce's set list, too. And really: was there ever any doubt that Woody's "Riding in My Car" (also known as "Car Song") would be the one that grabbed Bruce's attention?

Like Bruce would remark when he debuted it at a 1996 Guthrie tribute concert, "Automobiles: that's my business. Mr. Guthrie, no disrespect but that's *my* business."

"Riding in My Car" was a natural choice for Bruce to cover; the only question for those in attendance as he introduced it was: could Bruce nail the car noises?

Of course he could.

Believe it or not, Bruce's cover of "Riding in My Car" has been officially released–you can find it on *'Til We Outnumber Them*, which documents that 1996 tribute concert.

For fans of Woody and Bruce, that's great news, because we're highly unlikely to hear Bruce cover it in concert again.
