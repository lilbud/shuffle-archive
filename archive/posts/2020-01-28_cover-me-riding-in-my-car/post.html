<p>Bruce Springsteen his covered the work of Woody Guthrie time and again.</p>
<p>“<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2023/07/04/cover-me-this-land-is-your-land/">This Land Is Your Land</a>” was a River Tour staple; “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/01/21/cover-me-hard-times-come-again-no-more/">Hard Times (Come Again No More)</a>” was a featured encore throughout the Working on a Dream Tour.</p>
<p>Bruce has covered folk classics like “<a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/02/08/cover-me-woody-guthries-lonesome-valley/">Lonesome Valley</a>” and “<a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/01/05/cover-me-deportee-plane-wreck-at-los-gatos/">Deportee (Plane Wreck at Los Gatos)</a>” in concert, and he’s released a studio recording of “<a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/02/10/cover-me-rotd-i-aint-got-no-home/">I Ain’t Got No Home</a>.”</p>
<p>But as soon as Bruce became a parent, we knew it was only a matter of time before Guthrie’s children’s songs showed up in Bruce’s set list, too. And really: was there ever any doubt that Woody’s “Riding in My Car” (also known as “Car Song”) would be the one that grabbed Bruce’s attention?</p>

<p>Like Bruce would remark when he debuted it at a 1996 Guthrie tribute concert, “Automobiles: that’s my business. Mr. Guthrie, no disrespect but that’s <em>my </em>business.”</p>
<p>“Riding in My Car” was a natural choice for Bruce to cover; the only question for those in attendance as he introduced it was: could Bruce nail the car noises?</p>
<p>Of course he could.</p>

<p>Believe it or not, Bruce’s cover of “Riding in My Car” has been officially released–you can find it on <em>‘Til We Outnumber Them</em>, which documents that 1996 tribute concert.</p>
<p>For fans of Woody and Bruce, that’s great news, because we’re highly unlikely to hear Bruce cover it in concert again.</p>
