<p>Michelle Moore is certainly qualified to cover Bruce’s “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2023/03/20/roll-of-the-dice-rocky-ground/">Rocky Ground</a>” — she sings and raps on the studio track, after all, and she was a featured vocalist throughout the Wrecking Ball tour whenever this song  was in the setlist.</p>
<p>So it’s great to see and hear her take the reins on the full song, supported by The Alliance Singers (who together with Michelle, provide backing vocals on tracks from <em>The Rising </em>and <em>The Promise</em> as well).</p>
<p>Enjoy this performance from “Thunder Road Thursday,” a Bruce birthday celebration at the Freehold Acoustic Lounge on September 26, 2013.</p>
