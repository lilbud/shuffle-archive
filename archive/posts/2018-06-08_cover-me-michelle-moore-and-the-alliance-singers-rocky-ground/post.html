<p>So it’s great to see and hear her take the reins on the full song, supported by The Alliance Singers (who together with Michelle, provide backing vocals on tracks from <em>The Rising </em>and <em>The Promise</em> as well).</p>
<p>Enjoy this performance from “Thunder Road Thursday,” a Bruce birthday celebration at the Freehold Acoustic Lounge on September 26, 2013.</p>
