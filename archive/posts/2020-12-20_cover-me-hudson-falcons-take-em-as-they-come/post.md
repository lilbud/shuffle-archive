Take Bruce’s 1980 power pop outtake, pass directly through garage rock, and stop just an inch shy of punk, and what do you get?

You get this fantastic cover of “” from New Jersey legends the Hudson Falcons. Take a listen, but first turn the volume up

This isn’t the only time the Falcons have covered Bruce (check out of ““)–but it’s arguably their most successful attempt at blending the spirit of the original with their own sound.

It’s a great rendition of a vastly underappreciated song.
