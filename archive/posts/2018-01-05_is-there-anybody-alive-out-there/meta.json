Probably not.</p>\n<p>So why am I writing this one?\u00a0 Mostly as an outlet for my own views and an opportunity to do some writing. I&#8217;m a historian, and I delve deep into any topic that fascinates me, so I&#8217;m hoping to use this platform as an opportunity to occasionally dig a little more deeply than most Springsteen books or articles.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also an opportunity to open up my vault of rare Springsteen recordings, videos, photos, articles, and more. Once upon a time they seemed like currency in an underground trading community. But in the age of cell phones and torrents and &#8220;official bootlegs&#8221; streaming media, it&#8217;s easier to come by new shows, and I&#8217;d rather focus on sharing my collection and providing some context along with it.</p>\n<p>So what should you expect to see here? To start, there will be three different series of postings:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Kingdom of Days</strong>: Published daily, these are brief &#8220;On this Day in Bruce History&#8221; articles. More than anything else, it&#8217;s how I&#8217;ll open up my archives and share some really cool nuggets. Look for rare audio, photos, and articles here.</li>\n<li><strong>Roll of the Dice</strong>: Published once or twice weekly (I&#8217;ll settle on a cadence once I see how much time they take), these are longer history and/or analysis pieces, each dedicated to a single Bruce Springsteen song. Why &#8220;Roll of the Dice?&#8221; Because after the first one, which I&#8217;ll post later today, I&#8217;ll be using a random generator to pick the song. (I&#8217;ll also entertain requests!)</li>\n<li><strong>Cover Me</strong>: Published whenever I feel like it, these are notable covers of Bruce Springsteen songs by other artists, or of other artists by Bruce.</li>\n<li><strong>Meeting Across the River:</strong> Published whenever I feel like it, these are rare duets and guest performances with other artists.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#8230;and I suspect that as things get rolling, other series ideas may come to mind.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, please check out the first two posts (probably already live by the time you read this)&#8211;you&#8217;ll find, among other things, a recording of the very first performance of &#8220;Land of Hope and Dreams&#8221;&#8211;and come back tomorrow for another Kingdom of Days mini-archive.</p>\n<p>And please share your comments, suggestions and feedback!</p>\n<p>See you further on up the road!</p>\n<p>Ken</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>Welcome!
