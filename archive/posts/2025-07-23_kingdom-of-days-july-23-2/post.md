***New for 2025:** Audio for 1982; video for 2009 and 2016*

**1971:** The Bruce Springsteen Band opens for The Richard Goldman Band in Damrosch Park in New York City, delivering a fantastic, jazzy, horn-fueled hour-long set. The show was recorded from the soundboard in absolutely *outstanding* quality, perhaps the best recording from this period. If you haven’t given it a listen before, trust me: do so now.

**1988:** Another installment of *Legends of Springsteen* — Bruce encounters John Magnusson, a Danish street musician, playing on the streets of Copenhagen and stops to play a few songs with him. A crowd quickly gathers, one of whom has the presence of mind to film the impromptu mini-concert.
