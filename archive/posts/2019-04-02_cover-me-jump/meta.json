The song remains Van Halen&#8217;s greatest hit, and it&#8217;s enshrined in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as one of the <em>500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll</em>.</p>\n<p>Still, Bruce never showed any interest in covering it until he played a special free concert at the NCAA&#8217;s March Madness Music Festival. Never one to resist a theme-appropriate opener, Bruce and Nils faced off at center court (c&#8217;mon, Bruce, was that really a fair match-up? You had to pick the shortest member of the band?) in a moment that was only a little bit awkward.</p>\n<p>When the signature keyboards kicked in, it only took a moment for the crowd to recognize the song, and by the time Max&#8217;s drums kicked in, you can feel the crowd realizing, &#8220;this is for real!&#8221;</p>\n<p>The E Street Band proved remarkably well-suited for the song, particularly with guest-member Tom Morello handling the guitar solo.
