The Revue performed only one show on <a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/05/12/kingdom-of-days-may-12/\">May 12th</a> and two shows on <a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/05/13/kingdom-of-days-may-13/\">the 13th</a>, but while it lasted it was a glorious concert experience.</p>\n<p>For most of the shows&#8211;including &#8220;Got to Get You Off My Mind,&#8221; which the Revue played as the second song for each show, Steve performed lead vocals, with Bruce on guitar and backing vocals.
