Bruce cancels a sold-out show at the University of Maryland when he learns that the venue holds 10,000 people. (At this point in his career, Bruce is violently opposed to playing large venues.) Instead, the Born to Run Tour moves on to Michigan Palace in Detroit, and the hype and emerging backlash is starting to get to Bruce. Bruce will recall this as a night on which he didn’t want to perform, but with his band around him and a set list constructed to keep the energy level high, he nevertheless delivers a great show that features his live debut of “”
