It’s hard to find a more perfectly suited pairing for Bruce than the very-Springsteen-influenced Gaslight Anthem. It’s hard to tell who’s having more fun in this 2009 HD clip–Brian and Bruce are clearly both having a ball.

“The ’59 Sound” was the title track and lead single from The Gaslight Anthem’s second album. Released in the summer of 2008, it became a critical hit if not a popular one. (It peaked at #35 on the Billboard Alternative chart.)
