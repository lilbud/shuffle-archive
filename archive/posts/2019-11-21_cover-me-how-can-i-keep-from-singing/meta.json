Seeger&#8217;s version of &#8220;How Can I Keep From Singing&#8221; updates the song with a modern verse that refers to persecution that&#8217;s more political than religious:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>When tyrants tremble, sick with fear, and hear their death-knell ringing</em><br />\n<em>When friends rejoice both far and near, how can I keep from singing?</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>In prison cell and dungeon vile, our thoughts to them go winging</em><br />\n<em>When friends by shame are undefiled, how can I keep from singing?</em></p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"How Can I Keep from Singing (Live)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SRIY2SrYq98?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Bruce&#8217;s version keeps the first half of that verse but otherwise keeps his cover trim and taut, clocking in at 2:18 and letting the singers&#8217; harmonies communicate the faith and solidarity at the heart of the song better than the lyrics can.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"How Can I Keep from Singing\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3qQ6rvBaQJ8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>In the recording above, Bruce is just another member of the choir, his voice at equal power with the rest of the singers.
