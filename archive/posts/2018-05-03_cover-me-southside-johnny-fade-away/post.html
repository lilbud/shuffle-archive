<p>Last week, I wrote about Bruce’s sublime “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/04/28/roll-of-the-dice-fade-away/">Fade Away.</a>” It takes a lot of guts to cover it–there’s not much room (if any) for improvement.</p>
<p>But if anyone can do it justice, it’s Southside Johnny. His voice and style are perfectly suited for it, and he hits it out of the park. Just a beautiful, beautiful cover, from his 1997 <em>Spittin Fire</em> live album.</p>
