So it&#8217;s remarkable that in early 1982 (with <em>Nebraska </em> likely very much on his mind), he sat down at home in Colt&#8217;s Neck, pressed the record button on a cassette recorder, and played this:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen Baby I&#039;m So Cold Turn The Lights Down Low\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZRt53xaHyYQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Since the lyrics are so close to those of &#8220;Loose Ends,&#8221; I&#8217;ll save my detailed analysis for when I someday profile that classic from\u00a0<em>Tracks.</em> But even though the lyrics are strikingly similar, the subtle differences make for an entirely different song.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Loose Ends&#8221; is the retelling of a break-up; &#8220;Baby, I&#8217;m So Cold&#8221; foreshadows one.</p>\n<p>Because &#8220;Baby, I&#8217;m So Cold&#8221; takes place after the love has gone but before the lovers have, it is (in my opinion, at least) a more intimate and emotionally powerful song.</p>\n<p>The chorus&#8211;unique to this song&#8211;simply finds the lovers estranged from each other but clinging to each other, as if huddling around the embers of their former passion could ease the chill they feel inside.</p>\n<p>Listen again, and marvel at how Bruce is able to craft an entirely difference song with only small changes to existing elements.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>We met on open streets</em><br />\n<em>We had no place to go</em><br />\n<em>I remember how my heart beat</em><br />\n<em>When you said &#8220;Bobby, I love you so&#8221;</em><br />\n<em>Then little by little, baby, now I don&#8217;t know</em><br />\n<em>We lost the love, so long ago</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Now I&#8217;m so cold, and we turn the lights down low</em><br />\n<em>So cold, baby, I&#8217;m so cold, and we turn the lights down low</em><br />\n<em>So cold, baby, I&#8217;m cold</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>We both made promises we couldn&#8217;t keep</em><br />\n<em>Now last night, my girl, you were crying in your sleep</em><br />\n<em>Baby, we used to walk on nights just like this</em><br />\n<em>I would hold you in my arms, fill you with my kiss</em><br />\n<em>(Hold you in my arms, protect you with my kiss)</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Now I&#8217;m so cold, and we turn the lights down low</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;m so cold, baby, I&#8217;m so cold, we turn the lights down low</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Our love has fallen around us</em><br />\n<em>Like we said it never could</em><br />\n<em>It happened to us, we said it never would</em><br />\n<em>How could something so bad, baby, happen to something so good</em><br />\n<em>I don&#8217;t know, I don&#8217;t know</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>We got no new dreams, baby, left to touch</em><br />\n<em>We&#8217;re lost like strangers who know too much</em><br />\n<em>About each other, it was ???</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;m scared but I fear the cold coming in the night</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Now I&#8217;m so cold, and we turn the lights down low</em><br />\n<em>So cold, baby, I&#8217;m so cold, and we turn the lights down low</em><br />\n<em>And we turn the lights down low</em><br />\n<em>And we turn the lights down low</em><br />\n<em>And we turn the lights down low</em></p>\n<p>(Yes, those are lyrics that would someday end up in &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/04/06/roll-of-the-dice-janey-dont-you-lose-heart/\">Janey, Don&#8217;t You Lose Heart</a>&#8221; in that final verse.)</p>\n<p>&#8220;Baby I&#8217;m So Cold&#8221; never made it to an official release, but it certainly wasn&#8217;t a passing flight of fancy; Bruce felt strongly enough about this new song to take it into the studio with E Street Band in May 1982 during the <em>Born in the U.S.A.</em> sessions.</p>\n<p>That recording likely resides in the vault, a strong candidate (we can only hope) for eventual release on a <em>Born in the U.S.A.\u00a0</em>box set).</p>\n<p><strong>Baby, I&#8217;m So Cold</strong><br />\n<strong>Recorded:</strong> Early 1982 (acoustic demo), May 11, 1982 (studio)<br />\n<strong>Never released</strong><br />\n<strong>Never performed</strong></p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
