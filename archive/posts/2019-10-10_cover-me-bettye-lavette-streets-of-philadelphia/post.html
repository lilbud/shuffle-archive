<p>Just… wow.</p>
<p>I’ve been familiar with Bettye LaVette’s incredibly powerful cover of Bruce’s elegiac “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/06/30/roll-of-the-dice-streets-of-philadelphia/">Streets of Philadelphia</a>” since it was released on the outstanding <em>Song of America </em>triple CD collection back in 2007. (Thank you, Janet Reno!)</p>
<p>But as I searched for the video to include with this post, I came across a live performance from December 2017, and like I said… wow.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sg0Gj6EAYM">Watch on Youtube: Bettye LaVette @ Outpost in the Burbs - "Streets of Philadelphia"</a></p>
<p>LaVette absolutely <em>owns</em> Bruce’s award-winning song, both on stage and in the studio.</p>
<p>The live video is the more powerful of the two, but the studio version benefits from a fuller sound and the addition of a subtle bass:</p>

<p>I honestly don’t know which version I prefer, but both mesmerize me.</p>
<p>These are performances that will stick with you long after you first listen.</p>
