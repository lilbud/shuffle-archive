Yet, Bruce still managed to score two Top Ten singles in 1986: &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/04/09/roll-of-the-dice-my-hometown/\">My Hometown,</a>&#8221; which peaked at #6 in the early weeks of the year, and &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/05/27/cover-me-war/\">War</a>,&#8221; which notched a #9 berth at the tail end of it.</p>\n<p>Escaping most of his fans&#8217; notice at the time, however, was a\u00a0<em>third</em> hit single in 1986 with a Springsteen credit.</p>\n<p>In the waning days of summer, the late country star Mel McDaniel released a cover of Bruce&#8217;s obscure B-side &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/10/08/roll-of-the-dice-stand-on-it/\">Stand On It</a>&#8221; as the lead single for his upcoming album, <em>Just Can&#8217;t Sit Down Music.</em></p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Mel McDaniel -- Stand On It\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vbdWX1Sf-74?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>McDaniel tended to go against the grain of country music tropes, eschewing tales of broken hearts and sorrows in favor of upbeat happy songs. &#8220;Stand On It&#8221; fit the bill nicely.</p>\n<p>That may be why Bruce reportedly sent McDaniel the song to record. &#8220;I&#8217;ve never met Bruce Springsteen,&#8221; McDaniel said in a 1987 interview. &#8220;I guess they heard &#8216;Stand Up&#8217; [McDaniel&#8217;s previous hit] and sent us &#8216;Stand On It.'&#8221;</p>\n<p>Already a rockabilly song in its original arrangement, it was easy for McDaniel to adapt, and he took it all the way to #12 on the Hot Country Singles chart in the U.S. and to #5 in Canada.</p>\n<p>The song&#8217;s popularity earned McDaniel an array of television performances, including this live appearance on <em>Nashville Now</em>.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Mel McDaniel  Stand on it Live  Nashville Now\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-36wxEmJYMs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;Stand On It&#8221; remained a fan favorite for the rest of McDaniel&#8217;s career, which unfortunately ended abruptly, tragically, and prematurely in 1996 when he fell into the pit while performing and nearly died.
