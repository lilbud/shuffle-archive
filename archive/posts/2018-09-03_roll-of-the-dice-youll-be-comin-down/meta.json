Whereas &#8220;Lucky Town&#8221; is optimistic, fueled by idealism tempered with life experience, &#8220;You&#8217;ll Be Comin&#8217; Down&#8221; is downright cynical.</p>\n<p>Something about Bruce&#8217;s vocal delivery keeps it from tipping over into outright bitterness, however. Instead, the singer seems at peace rather than resigned, confident rather than angry. That&#8217;s all in the delivery, because the lyrics tell a different story:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>White roses and misty blue eyes</em><br />\n<em>Red mornings, then nothin&#8217; but gray skies</em><br />\n<em>A cup of coffee, a heart shot clean through</em><br />\n<em>The jacket you bought me gone daisy gray-blue</em></p>\n<p>Bruce has a sure hand with metaphor, but he mostly restrains it in this song. Instead, he relies on color as his dominant conceit: the girl he sings about is vividly lit in vibrant colors, but everything she touches fades, from the skies above her to the gifts she bestowed.\u00a0 (It&#8217;s a little lazy to use gray twice&#8211;even modified as gray-blue&#8211;but we&#8217;ll let that slide.)</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>You&#8217;re smiling now but you&#8217;ll find out</em><br />\n<em>They&#8217;ll use you up and spit you out now</em><br />\n<em>Your head&#8217;s spinnin&#8217; in diamonds and clouds</em><br />\n<em>But pretty soon it turns out</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>You&#8217;ll be comin&#8217; down now baby</em><br />\n<em>You&#8217;ll be coming down</em><br />\n<em>What goes around, it comes around and</em><br />\n<em>You&#8217;ll be comin&#8217; down</em></p>\n<p>Reading those lines, it would be easy to hear spite and bitterness, but Bruce&#8217;s delivery is that of someone who&#8217;s lived a long life and is secure in the knowledge that life is full of ups and downs&#8211;and if you don&#8217;t live the life of someone who&#8217;s going to eventually have downs, you won&#8217;t be prepared for them when they come.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Easy street, a quick buck and true lies</em><br />\n<em>Smiles as thin as those dusky blue skies</em><br />\n<em>A silver plate of pearls my golden child</em><br />\n<em>It&#8217;s all yours at least for a little while</em></p>\n<p>Back to the color wheel we go, although this time it&#8217;s in service of a monetary metaphor, &#8220;golden child&#8221; serving in both senses. And then, as is often the case with Bruce&#8217;s songs, we arrive at the one sentence that captures the essence of the entire song:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>You&#8217;ll be fine long as your pretty face holds out</em><br />\n<em>Then it&#8217;s gonna get pretty cold out</em></p>\n<p>That&#8217;s it right there: a prediction and a warning delivered with sadness and affection. The end of the verse and the bridge are basically identical in meaning, driving home the singer&#8217;s message (in case it&#8217;s been too subtle):</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>An empty stream of stars shooting by</em><br />\n<em>You got your hopes on high</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>For a while you&#8217;ll go sparklin&#8217; by</em><br />\n<em>Just another pretty thing on high</em></p>\n<p>The last verse ends the song on a weak note, in my opinion:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Like a thief on a Sunday morning</em><br />\n<em>It all falls apart with no warning</em><br />\n<em>Your cinnamon sky&#8217;s gone candy-apple green</em><br />\n<em>The crushed metal of your little flying machine</em></p>\n<p>These are odd metaphors: maybe I&#8217;m just unfamiliar with a life of crime, but exactly is it about Sundays that poses a danger to thieves? And I&#8217;m not sure why a green sky would be any less alarming, concerning, or foreboding than a red one.</p>\n<p>But with preceding context, it&#8217;s pretty clear that Bruce is saying that someday this woman will lose her beauty and vivacity, and it may happen suddenly and to severe and immediate effect. There&#8217;s no indication that the object of the song is listening or will ever hear it, however, so we&#8217;re left to just consider it a message to heed ourselves.</p>\n<p>IMHO, &#8220;You&#8217;ll Be Comin&#8217; Down&#8221; is the weakest song on\u00a0<em>Magic,\u00a0</em>and perhaps that&#8217;s why Bruce has only ever played it live once, in the heart of that album&#8217;s tour in Columbus. Here&#8217;s a pro-shot snippet and an audio clip of the performance in its entirety.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"You&#039;ll be coming down Bruce Springsteen\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/w6jctYNR8Ds?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - You&#039;ll Be Comin&#039; Down (Live 24-3-2008)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZhcOV4f3xho?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>It&#8217;s actually a solid performance, both on stage and on record, and the song itself isn&#8217;t\u00a0 bad either.
