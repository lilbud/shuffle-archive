Those B-sides included two songs Bruce would eventually debut during the Born in the U.S.A. Tour (&#8220;Sugarland&#8221; and &#8220;Follow That Dream&#8221;), along with three others that still have yet to see the light of day: &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/01/06/roll-of-the-dice-dont-back-down/\">Don&#8217;t Back Down</a>,&#8221; &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/06/15/roll-of-the-dice-little-girl-like-you/\">Little Girl (Like You)</a>,&#8221; and &#8220;One Love.&#8221;</p>\n<p>When I wrote about &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/06/15/roll-of-the-dice-little-girl-like-you/\">Little Girl (Like You)</a>&#8221; last spring, I wasn&#8217;t very kind in my assessment. &#8220;One Love&#8221; is better (faint praise that may be), but it still suffers from an overly simple conceit, a lack of imagination, and Bruce&#8217;s newfound fascination with drum machines.
