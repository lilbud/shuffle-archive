Bruce uses current events as a jump-off point for the song, but it quickly&#8211;everything about this song is quick&#8211;establishes a more timeless theme.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I was out driving, just a-taking it slow</em><br />\n<em>Looked at my tank, it was reading low</em><br />\n<em>Pulled in an Exxon station out on Highway One</em><br />\n<em>Held up without a gun</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Some damn fool with a guitar walks in off the street</em><br />\n<em>Ain&#8217;t got nowhere to go, ain&#8217;t got nothing to eat</em><br />\n<em>Man with a cigar says &#8220;sign here, son&#8221;</em><br />\n<em>Held up without a gun</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Now it&#8217;s a sin and it oughta be a crime</em><br />\n<em>You know it happens buddy all the time</em><br />\n<em>Trying to make a living, trying to have a little fun</em><br />\n<em>Held up without a gun</em></p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t let that second verse fly past you&#8211;it&#8217;s the key to the song.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also a ten-second synopsis of &#8220;The Promise.&#8221; A few years down the road from his lawsuit settlement with former manager Mike Appel, Bruce obviously still carried a little bit of baggage with him.\u00a0The third verse ties a bow on it: can&#8217;t a guy just do his job and enjoy it without someone trying to swindle him?</p>\n<p>&#8220;Held Up Without a Gun&#8221; had only a single live outing following its B-side release, on New Year&#8217;s Eve 1980, but that live performance (as brief as the studio track) got not one but two official releases: one on\u00a0<em>The Essential Bruce Springsteen\u00a0</em>in 2003, and one when Bruce&#8217;s official archive series released the entire show.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Held Up Without a Gun (Live at Nassau Coliseum, Uniondale, NY - December 1980)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SZDRGo3euZo?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>It would be more than 27 years before Bruce performed it again in concert, but when gas prices spiked in 2008 during the Magic Tour, he brought it back for three encore performances that summer.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen Held Up Without A Gun Giants Stadium New Jersey 28/07/2008\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mIbVndmUJ-E?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;Held Up Without a Gun&#8221; made one more appearance, on the Wrecking Ball Tour in 2012.

If you&#8217;re lucky enough to catch it, pay attention&#8211;because if you blink, you might miss it.</p>\n<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> Like much of Bruce&#8217;s River-era material &#8220;Held Up Without a Gun&#8221; started out as an acoustic home demo. In this recording (slower than but just as brief as the final electric version), we can hear Bruce working on his lyrics. Although there are some notable detail differences, the verses are remarkably close to their final form.</p>\n<audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-29687-2\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/114-Held-Up-Without-A-Gun.mp3?_=2\" /><a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/114-Held-Up-Without-A-Gun.mp3\">https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/114-Held-Up-Without-A-Gun.mp3</a></audio>\n<p><strong>Held Up Without a Gun<br />\nRecorded:</strong> February 23 &#8211; April 1, 1980<br />\n<strong>Released:</strong>\u00a0<em>The River: Outtakes</em> (2015)<br />\n<strong>First performed:</strong> December 31, 1980 (Uniondale, NY)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> October 25, 2012 (Hartford, CT)</p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
