<p>Even today, he’s likely to feature songs like “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/10/31/roll-of-the-dice-factory/">Factory</a>” and “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2023/05/01/roll-of-the-dice-youngstown/">Youngstown</a>” in his acoustic sets.</p>

<p>His high-water mark, though, is undoubtedly his band’s joyously rollicking cover of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/11/18/roll-of-the-dice-no-surrender/">No Surrender</a>” from his <em>Mandorock 2000 Live </em>album.</p>

<p>Beer’s version of “No Surrender” leans heavily on Gareth Turner’s melodeon, infusing Bruce’s song with a zydeco spirit that’s impossible to resist.</p>
<p>Introduced as a one-off cover, “No Surrender” immediately became a fan favorite and has remained a consistent encore number ever since.</p>
