Bruce’s penchant for tinkering with old recordings and grafting modern elements has accelerated in recent years, and sometimes the seams are more noticeable than others. (I’m looking at you, “[The Brokenhearted](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/08/20/roll-of-the-dice-the-brokenhearted/).”)

*The Promise* is full of such hybrid creations, but “Wrong Side of the Street” is one of the subtler ones: a vintage 1977 backing track paired with modern 2010-ish vocals.

Originally and mystifyingly recorded under the title “English Song” on October 14, 1977, the song escaped into the wild via enterprising bootleggers. Unfortunately, though, the version that circulated for years had lyrics that were somewhat bluffed and largely incoherent. Take a listen:

It’s not at all clear that Bruce intended the song to be called “Wrong Side of the Street,” and in fact the phrase only appears a couple of times (as does the phrase, “Endless Night,” which is the title the bootleg version often circulated under).

But when Bruce decided to spruce up the song for release on his 2010 *[Darkness on the Edge of Town](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/07/05/album-companion-darkness-on-the-edge-of-town/)*companion album, *The Promise*, that’s the phrase that Bruce seemed to glom on to.

And it works, because “Wrong Side of the Street” is a light, straightforward rocker that’s about the late-night rendezvous of a couple from opposite sides of the metaphorical tracks–or, I suppose, the street.

Lyrically, “Wrong Side of the Street” is far from Bruce’s best work–there’s nothing objectionable, but neither is there anything of brilliance.

*Turn on the radio, turn off the lights*  
*We’ll bring an end, darling, to your endless night*  
*You’re on the wrong side of the street*

*I see your fortune in the lines in your face*  
*I knew you’re looking for your saving grace*  
*You’re on the wrong side of the street*

*Fear and desire such a sweet confusion*  
*Well, open your eyes and throw down your illusions*  
*And see you never belonged here with me*

*You and your poetry and your cool, cool world*  
*You been working hard on that face of a martyr girl*  
*You’re on the wrong side of the street*

*You got the look and you own your world*  
*But here you better check your diamonds and your pearls*  
*You’re on the wrong side of the street*

*You get bored of every day bringing the same*  
*So you go out looking for some strange new games*  
*But pretty soon you don’t know the score or what you’re looking for*

*You get bored of every day bringing the same*  
*So you go out looking for some strange new games*  
*But pretty soon you don’t know the score or what you came here for*

*Turn on the radio, turn off the lights*  
*We’ll bring an end, darling, to this endless night*  
*Here on the wrong side of the street*

*Fear and desire such a sweet confusion*  
*Well, open your eyes and throw down your illusions*  
*And see tonight there’s no one here but you and me*

Nothing really happens in “Wrong Side of the Street.” The lovers appear to be suspended in time, which is perhaps the point: they hide away in the night because neither belongs in the other’s world.

Like several of the songs on *The Promise*, I can’t help but suspect that the modern lyrics for “Wrong Side of the Street” were more in service of rescuing and releasing the backing track than in any true storytelling inspiration.

It’s hard to blame Bruce, though, because it’s a great backing track with terrific tandem solos from Bruce and Clarence. Still, “Wrong Side of the Street” is a lyrical lightweight, likely to remain unperformed for the foreseeable future.
