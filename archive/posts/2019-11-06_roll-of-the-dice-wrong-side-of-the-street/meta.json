(I&#8217;m looking at you, &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/08/20/roll-of-the-dice-the-brokenhearted/\">The Brokenhearted</a>.&#8221;)</p>\n<p><em>The Promise\u00a0</em>is full of such hybrid creations, but &#8220;Wrong Side of the Street&#8221; is one of the subtler ones: a vintage 1977 backing track paired with modern 2010-ish vocals.</p>\n<p>Originally and mystifyingly recorded under the title &#8220;English Song&#8221; on October 14, 1977, the song escaped into the wild via enterprising bootleggers. Unfortunately, though, the version that circulated for years had lyrics that were somewhat bluffed and largely incoherent. Take a listen:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN - Endless Night (English Sons) - remast. outtake, 1978\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zEYtyVdY7Rc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>It&#8217;s not at all clear that Bruce intended the song to be called &#8220;Wrong Side of the Street,&#8221; and in fact the phrase only appears a couple of times (as does the phrase, &#8220;Endless Night,&#8221; which is the title the bootleg version often circulated under).</p>\n<p>But when Bruce decided to spruce up the song for release on his 2010\u00a0<em><a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/07/05/album-companion-darkness-on-the-edge-of-town/\">Darkness on the Edge of Town</a>\u00a0</em>companion album,\u00a0<em>The Promise</em>, that&#8217;s the phrase that Bruce seemed to glom on to.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Wrong Side of the Street\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gtxR_9j6kLg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>And it works, because &#8220;Wrong Side of the Street&#8221; is a light, straightforward rocker that&#8217;s about the late-night rendezvous of a couple from opposite sides of the metaphorical tracks&#8211;or, I suppose, the street.</p>\n<p>Lyrically, &#8220;Wrong Side of the Street&#8221; is far from Bruce&#8217;s best work&#8211;there&#8217;s nothing objectionable, but neither is there anything of brilliance.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Turn on the radio, turn off the lights</em><br />\n<em>We&#8217;ll bring an end, darling, to your endless night</em><br />\n<em>You&#8217;re on the wrong side of the street</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I see your fortune in the lines in your face</em><br />\n<em>I knew you&#8217;re looking for your saving grace</em><br />\n<em>You&#8217;re on the wrong side of the street</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Fear and desire such a sweet confusion</em><br />\n<em>Well, open your eyes and throw down your illusions</em><br />\n<em>And see you never belonged here with me</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>You and your poetry and your cool, cool world</em><br />\n<em>You been working hard on that face of a martyr girl</em><br />\n<em>You&#8217;re on the wrong side of the street</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>You got the look and you own your world</em><br />\n<em>But here you better check your diamonds and your pearls</em><br />\n<em>You&#8217;re on the wrong side of the street</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>You get bored of every day bringing the same</em><br />\n<em>So you go out looking for some strange new games</em><br />\n<em>But pretty soon you don&#8217;t know the score or what you&#8217;re looking for</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>You get bored of every day bringing the same</em><br />\n<em>So you go out looking for some strange new games</em><br />\n<em>But pretty soon you don&#8217;t know the score or what you came here for</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Turn on the radio, turn off the lights</em><br />\n<em>We&#8217;ll bring an end, darling, to this endless night</em><br />\n<em>Here on the wrong side of the street</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Fear and desire such a sweet confusion</em><br />\n<em>Well, open your eyes and throw down your illusions</em><br />\n<em>And see tonight there&#8217;s no one here but you and me</em></p>\n<p>Nothing really happens in &#8220;Wrong Side of the Street.&#8221; The lovers appear to be suspended in time, which is perhaps the point: they hide away in the night because neither belongs in the other&#8217;s world.</p>\n<p>Like several of the songs on <em>The Promise</em>, I can&#8217;t help but suspect that the modern lyrics for &#8220;Wrong Side of the Street&#8221; were more in service of rescuing and releasing the backing track than in any true storytelling inspiration.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s hard to blame Bruce, though, because it&#8217;s a great backing track with terrific tandem solos from Bruce and Clarence.
