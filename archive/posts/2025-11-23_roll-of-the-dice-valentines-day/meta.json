Bruce plays every instrument we hear from the ambling, primary guitar melody to the layers of keyboard, mandolin, bass, harmonica and percussion.</p>\n<p>The result is a carefully crafted song that gradually builds instrumental intensity that to match the lyrical desperation that&#8217;s there from the beginning. Take a listen before we dive in:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Valentine&#039;s Day\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/h5XgjPfL8KM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>I&#8217;m driving a big lazy car rushin&#8217; up the highway in the dark</em></p>\n<p>At first, it does indeed sound like we&#8217;re out for an evening drive&#8211;there&#8217;s a relaxing, ambling tempo that belies what Bruce sings next:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>I got one hand steady on the wheel and one hand&#8217;s tremblin&#8217; over my heart</em><br />\n<em>It&#8217;s pounding baby like it&#8217;s gonna bust right on through</em><br />\n<em>And it ain&#8217;t gonna stop till I&#8217;m alone again with you</em></p>\n<p>Now\u00a0<em>that&#8217;s\u00a0</em>how you set a scene.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re instantly plunged into the middle of a story. What happened right before we got here to make our protagonist so consumed by adrenaline?</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>A friend of mine became a father last night</em><br />\n<em>When we spoke in his voice I could hear the light</em><br />\n<em>Of the skies and the rivers, the timberwolf in the pines</em><br />\n<em>And that great jukebox out on Route 39<br />\n</em><em>They say he travels fastest who travels alone</em><br />\n<em>But tonight I miss my girl, mister tonight I miss my home</em></p>\n<p>Aha&#8211;we still don&#8217;t know where we was, but we do know that his encounter with a new father (in real life, Bruce was inspired by Jon Landau&#8217;s recent entry into fatherhood) has shaken him to his core. As any father knows, those first moments with your child are transformative: in a heartbeat, your life has a new purpose, and that first day as a parent&#8211;I remember mine well&#8211;is more vivid and indelible than any day prior or since.</p>\n<p>Our narrator picks up on that by osmosis. His friend is so altered, so heightened, that Bruce hears every indelible detail that is etched into his friend&#8217;s heart forevermore. (It&#8217;s worth noting that Bruce wrote this song years before he was a parent himself. This song is testament to Bruce&#8217;s legendary empathy in his songwriting.) He is shaken, and he is consumed by a primal fear and compulsion to race home to his love and to his home.</p>\n<p>He may be racing home, but he isn&#8217;t able to outrun his experience. His thoughts&#8211;still noticing every sight and sound&#8211;are counterpoint to the leisurely pace of the music.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Is it the sound of the leaves left blown by the wayside</em><br />\n<em>That&#8217;s got me out here on this spooky old highway tonight</em><br />\n<em>Is it the cry of the river with the moonlight shining through</em><br />\n<em>That ain&#8217;t what scares me baby, what scares me is losing you</em></p>\n<p>And there it is: he&#8217;s realized that while he doesn&#8217;t have a child, he does have someone who fills life with the same color, the same vividness as his friend&#8217;s new child, and the power of that tie, that bond, pulls him homeward. And that pull is irresistible.</p>\n<p>The final verse in this chorus-less song lays it all bare with a meta-wink from Bruce to his fans:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>They say if you die in your dreams, you really die in your bed</em><br />\n<em>But honey last night I dreamed my eyes rolled straight back in my head</em><br />\n<em>And God&#8217;s light came shinin&#8217; on through</em><br />\n<em>I woke up in the darkness scared and breathin&#8217; and born anew</em><br />\n<em>It wasn&#8217;t the cold river bottom I felt rushing over me</em><br />\n<em>It wasn&#8217;t the bitterness of a dream that didn&#8217;t come true</em><br />\n<em>It wasn&#8217;t the wind in the grey fields I felt rushing through my arms</em><br />\n<em>No no baby, baby it was you</em></p>\n<p>Could it be a coincidence that Bruce pairs imagery of a river with a callback (&#8220;the bitterness of a dream that didn&#8217;t come true&#8221;) to the very song of his that bears its name? I suppose it could be. But I doubt it&#8211;the contrast is too powerful to be accidental.</p>\n<p>Bruce has come far enough in his life to recognize both the danger and the necessity of love. He&#8217;s seen how succumbing to it rashly can chain you in place forever, and he&#8217;s seen how accepting it truly can lift you and inspire you to heights you&#8217;d never otherwise reach.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m absolutely convinced that &#8220;Valentine&#8217;s Day&#8221; is meant to be a counterpoint to &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/03/04/roll-of-the-dice-the-river/\">The River,</a>&#8221; and my appreciation for both songs is deepened because of it.</p>\n<p>In fact, the narrator&#8217;s last words, just before the car vanishes off into the horizon, almost make one wonder whether these are in fact the same characters from &#8220;The River.&#8221;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>So hold me close honey, say you&#8217;re forever mine</em><br />\n<em>And tell me you&#8217;ll be my lonely valentine</em></p>\n<p>Interesting choice of words, there: &#8220;my <em>lonely</em> valentine.&#8221; Perhaps these aren&#8217;t star-crossed lovers. Perhaps they&#8217;ve grown distant, their love cooler. But there&#8217;s clearly a bond between them, and it&#8217;s powerful&#8211;a different kind of power than the heat of young love, but a strong pull nonetheless.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s something of a mystery why Bruce didn&#8217;t play &#8220;Valentine&#8217;s Day&#8221; on the Tunnel of Love tour, or any of the tours that came after. He rehearsed it before the tour, though, and you can hear the only known E Street Band take below. Admirably restrained at first, the horns overpower it as the song progresses, and maybe that&#8217;s why Bruce dropped it from the set.</p>\n<div id=\"v-v4mjGEvF-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='426' src='https://videopress.com/embed/v4mjGEvF?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>For years, &#8220;Valentine&#8217;s Day&#8221; went unperformed, but then in the summer of 2005, Bruce rediscovered the song and premiered it on his solo acoustic tour.</p>\n<p>Performed entirely on the piano (and a harmonica coda), the music matches for the first time the power of the lyrics from start to finish.
