meta-description: "Bruce broke up the band on this date in 1989, but there are plenty of happy highlights too: the first-ever performances of “Drive All Night” and “Hungry Heart,” an adorable tape-recorded message to local schoolchildren, the premiere of Legends of Springsteen, Charlie’s first E Street appearance, and more.

Bruce and the boys play their second of two Lawsuit Tour shows at Georgetown University. “” features a strange one-off story interlude tonight, eerily incorporating “Tubular Bells” to underscore a (seasonal?) scary story.

**1976:** [Growin’ Up](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/09/29/roll-of-the-dice-growin-up/)

At Night Two in St. Louis on the River Tour, Bruce plays “,” “,” and ““– all for the very first time. Take a listen to “Hungry Heart” played without the audience sing-along–that tradition won’t start for another month.

**1980:** [Hungry Heart](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/12/21/roll-of-the-dice-hungry-heart/)[Drive All Night](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/02/27/roll-of-the-dice-drive-all-night/)[I’m a Rocker](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/09/18/roll-of-the-dice-im-a-rocker/)

Bruce postpones a scheduled Born in the U.S.A. show in Tacoma by a day due to illness. Local elementary school students send Bruce a care package with hand-drawn pictures and a get-well tape of them singing “Hungry Heart,” and Bruce responds in kind with a recording of him (accompanied by Roy) singing the song back to them.

**1984:**

Bruce decides its time for him to go it alone for a while. He calls up the members of the E Street Band, one by one, and breaks the news. In retrospect, it will seem like just a blip in a long, fraternal career, but at the time, and certainly at the beginning, it feels like forever.

**1989:**

The Rising Tour moves on to Bologna, where Bruce and the band tour premiere a “” one-off in the encores. My favorite highlight, however, is the final “Thunder Road.” The Italian crowd won’t let go of the coda, and Bruce eventually returns to the stage to accompany them on piano to bring the show to a close.

Sessions Band alumni Charlie Giordano, Lisa Lowell, Larry Eagle, Jeremy Chatzky, and Greg Liszt join the E Street Band for a show closing “” Although no one knows it at the time, Charlie will be back on the E Street stage a month later due to tragic circumstances.
