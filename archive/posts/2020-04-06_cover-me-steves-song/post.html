<p>In 1967, The Blues Project released their one and only studio album, <em>Projections</em>, featuring an eclectic collection of songs that spanned a spectrum of styles–appropriately so, for the impossible-to-classify group.</p>
<p>On that album was a lovely, lilting ballad called “Steve’s Song.” Written by Steve Katz (who would shortly go on to become a founding member of Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears), “Steve’s Song” is notable for its almost two-minute baroque-ish flute introduction before the song properly begins.</p>

<p>Although the band and the album had a devoted following, Katz’s first-ever song failed to set the charts on fire when it was released as a single.</p>
<p>But in central New Jersey, it caught at least one band’s attention. On September 16, 1967, at The Left Foot in Freehold, a band called The Castiles played “Steve’s Song” early in their set.</p>
<p>“Steve’s Song” was still new at the time–it had only been released on album ten months earlier–but that didn’t deter the young band from taking a run at it. Miraculously, that performance was captured on tape, in decent quality.</p>
<p>On lead vocals you’ll hear Castiles co-founder George Theiss, but on guitar you’ll hear <em>seventeen-year-old</em> Bruce Springsteen. (Bruce hadn’t yet moved into a permanent frontman role.)</p>

<p>That one recording from over a half-century ago remains the only time Bruce is known to have played Katz’s signature song.</p>
