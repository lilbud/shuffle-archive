In 1967, The Blues Project released their one and only studio album, *Projections*, featuring an eclectic collection of songs that spanned a spectrum of styles–appropriately so, for the impossible-to-classify group.

On that album was a lovely, lilting ballad called “Steve’s Song.” Written by Steve Katz (who would shortly go on to become a founding member of Blood, Sweat & Tears), “Steve’s Song” is notable for its almost two-minute baroque-ish flute introduction before the song properly begins.

Although the band and the album had a devoted following, Katz’s first-ever song failed to set the charts on fire when it was released as a single.

But in central New Jersey, it caught at least one band’s attention. On September 16, 1967, at The Left Foot in Freehold, a band called The Castiles played “Steve’s Song” early in their set.

“Steve’s Song” was still new at the time–it had only been released on album ten months earlier–but that didn’t deter the young band from taking a run at it. Miraculously, that performance was captured on tape, in decent quality.

On lead vocals you’ll hear Castiles co-founder George Theiss, but on guitar you’ll hear *seventeen-year-old* Bruce Springsteen. (Bruce hadn’t yet moved into a permanent frontman role.)

That one recording from over a half-century ago remains the only time Bruce is known to have played Katz’s signature song.
