**1978:** Bruce and the E Street Band wrap up their spectacular three-night Darkness Tour homecoming stand at Passaic's Capitol Theater. There won't be a birthday show this year, so the band and crew take the opportunity to present Bruce with an early on-stage "birthday cake."

**1979:** Bruce headlines the first of two famous "No Nukes" concerts at Madison Square Garden under the aegis of Musicians United for Safe Energy (MUSE), performing an abbreviated but well-documented set that features the very first performance of "[The River](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/03/04/roll-of-the-dice-the-river/)." That debut performance will become the song's official video, and audio recordings of "[Detroit Medley](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/12/27/cover-me-detroit-medley/)" and "[Stay](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/07/22/meeting-across-the-river-bruce-springsteen-and-jackson-browne-stay/)" (with Jackson Browne and Rosemary Butler) will be released on the official companion album released toward the end of the year. This show is available as part of Bruce's official archive series (get it [here](https://live.brucespringsteen.net/live-music/0,20918/Bruce-Springsteen---The-E-Street-Band-mp3-flac-download-9-21-1979-Madison-Square-Garden-New-York-NY.html)), and selections are available on video in the concert film, *The Legendary 1979 No Nukes Concerts*.

**1999:** Night Four (of six) in Philadelphia on the Reunion Tour starts with a surprise: the tour premiere and one-off performance of "[Little Queenie](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/12/11/cover-me-little-queenie/)" not seen at a proper concert since 1975. Rocketing from there into "[Take 'em as They Come](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/03/29/roll-of-the-dice-take-em-as-they-come/)," the show is off to a searing start.

**2001:** The world is still reeling from the effects of the 9/11 terror attacks on the U.S., nowhere more so than in the New York/New Jersey area. A national telethon is held to raise money for the victims and their families, and the show is broadcast live by every major American network. Bruce opens the event with a new song, "My City of Ruins," unplayed and unheard outside of its Asbury Park premiere the previous December. Bruce plays the song solo on acoustic guitar and harmonica, but he is surrounded by a choir of backing vocalists that include Patti, Steve, Clarence, Soozie, Lisa Lowell, Layonne Holmes, and Dee Holmes (backing vocalist for The Bruce Springsteen Band in Bruce's pre-E Street days).

**2003:** Two more "missing years" songs makes their tour (and E Street Band) debuts in the home stretch of the Rising Tour, when "[Local Hero](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/01/17/roll-of-the-dice-local-hero/)" and "[My Beautiful Reward](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2023/02/19/roll-of-the-dice-my-beautiful-reward/)" come out to play at Comerica Park in Detroit–but the best highlight is saved for the encores, when Martha Reeves joins Bruce and the band to play her 1963 hit "[Heat Wave](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/02/18/matr-bruce-springsteen-and-martha-reeves-heat-wave/)."
