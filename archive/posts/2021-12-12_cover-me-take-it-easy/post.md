Another great one gone too soon: Bruce Springsteen pays tribute to Glenn Frey, one day following his death on January 18, 2016.

“Take it Easy” was actually co-written by both Glenn Frey and Jackson Browne, and both The Eagles and Browne recorded it. The Eagles version came out first–it was, in fact, the band’s first single, released in 1972 and peaking at #12 on the Hot 100.
