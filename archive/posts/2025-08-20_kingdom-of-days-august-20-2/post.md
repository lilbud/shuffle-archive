**1979:** Bruce records “[Dollhouse](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/08/15/roll-of-the-dice-dollhouse/)” with the E Street Band at The Power Station in New York City. It will remain in the vault for almost two decades.

**1981:** Bruce and the boys play one of their most legendary, emotional and impassioned shows: a benefit for the Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation at the Sports Arena in Los Angeles, the first show of a six-night stand. Opening with “[Who’ll Stop the Rain](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2023/07/12/cover-me-wholl-stop-the-rain/)” (played here because of its actual content rather than its literal title), this show also features Bruce’s only known performance of “[Ballad of Easy Rider](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/01/04/cover-me-ballad-of-easy-rider/)” and a beautiful, emotional rendition of “[The River.](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/03/04/roll-of-the-dice-the-river/)”

**1984:** Yet another of the all-time great shows performed on this date–this time across the country at the Meadowlands, where Bruce and the band wrap up their ten-night Born in the U.S.A. stand. Steve Van Zandt makes his triumphant return to the E Street Band stage for the tour premiere of “[Two Hearts](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/05/28/roll-of-the-dice-two-hearts/)” and the live debut of a powerful “[Drift Away](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/06/14/cover-me-drift-away/).” The show is available as part of Bruce’s official archive series (get it [here](https://live.brucespringsteen.net/live-music/0,19087/Bruce-Springsteen---The-E-Street-Band-mp3-flac-download-8-20-1984-Brendan-Byrne-Arena-East-Rutherford-NJ.html)), where you can hear the strength of the bond between Bruce and Steve across the years. The Miami Horns also guest-star at this show, and the horn-fueled “[Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/11/19/roll-of-the-dice-tenth-avenue-freeze-out/)” will be released in the *Live 1975-85* box set.
