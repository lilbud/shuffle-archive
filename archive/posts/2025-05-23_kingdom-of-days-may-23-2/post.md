**2013:** The Wrecking Ball Tour stops in Naples for a show at the Piazza del Plebiscito, where the band opens with “O Sole Mio.” During the sign request collection, a fan actually requests “[Crazy Rocker](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/03/10/roll-of-the-dice-crazy-rocker/),” and it’s hard to tell if Bruce remembered that’s an actual song he’d (partially, at least) written. (He plays “Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)” instead.)
