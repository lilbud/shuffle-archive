<p>“Keep A-Knockin” was first recorded by blues artist James Wiggins in 1928…</p>

<p>…which inspired Louis Jordan to cut a smoother take on it in 1939…</p>

<p>…which in turn inspired Louis Jordan fan Little Richard to turn it into an uptempo stomp rocker in 1957.</p>

<p>And it’s Little Richard’s version that undoubtedly inspired Bruce’s only known performances. Bruce took a swing at it three times in the 1980s, all at club performances, and all with other artists.</p>
<p>The first time was at The Stone Pony with Cats on a Smooth Surface in July 1983–but unfortunately no audio of that performance has surfaced. A week later, though, Bruce covered it with Midnight Thunder at The Headline in nearby Neptune, and we are lucky to have <em>that</em> recording in soundboard clarity.</p>

<p>Five years later, Bruce took one final (to date) run at “Keep A-Knockin'” — this time with Southside Johnny and The Asbury Jukes at The Stone in San Francisco over Thanksgiving weekend, 1988. It’s a short performance (it segued into “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/12/11/cover-me-little-queenie/">Little Queenie</a>“) but a fun one, and you can hear it below.</p>
