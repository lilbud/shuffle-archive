<p>For one thing, it was a song about a teenage girl, written and recorded by a girl only a few months out of her teens herself. For another… well, listen and hear for yourself.</p>

<p>See what I mean? “Party Lights” is an uptempo pop song completely devoid of electric guitar, making it an odd choice for a budding rock star’s set list.</p>
<p>But if we’re willing to overlook the absent guitar, the rest of the arrangement seems tailor-made for the E Street Band, right down to the sax solo. It certainly was a hit, too–Philadelphia-based Claudine Clark earned her one-hit wonder status when she took “Party Lights” all the way to #5 on the Billboard Top 100 in 1962 and landing at #35 for the year.</p>
<p>Regardless of whatever lodged it in Bruce’s brain back in 1975, “Party Lights” was a perfect fit for the romantic, retro stylings of the Born to Run Tour. It made three brief appearances during early December, the first of which remains the best recording.</p>

<p>Bruce kept the arrangement faithful, right down to the Spectorian “whoa oh oh oh’s.” But after three performances in ten days, Bruce retired “Party Lights” and hasn’t played it since.</p>
<p>He didn’t forget about it, though. Four years later, Bruce recorded a track for <em>The River</em> that while destined for outtake status managed to contribute some <em>very</em> familiar lyrics to the Springsteen catalog.</p>
<p>While the music and the arrangement might have been very different, when the track was finally released officially in <em>The Ties That Bind: The River Collection</em>, we could hear for ourselves just how much of an impression Claudine Clark’s only hit single made on Bruce.</p>
<p>In fact, Bruce’s song sounds very much like a direct sequel. Clark’s original centered around a girl with some serious FOMO; Bruce’s more mature track revisits the same character long after those party lights have faded.</p>
<p>Take a listen to Bruce’s own version of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/11/14/roll-of-the-dice-party-lights/">Party Lights</a>” and hear for yourself.</p>
