**1990:** Bruce plays the first of a pair of unique, remarkable benefit shows for the Christic Institute, a public interest law firm. This is Bruce’s first “official” concert since disbanding the E Street Band. He’s out of his comfort zone, and it shows. His life has changed: he’s firmly attached to Patti now (even if they’re not yet married), he’s a father, and his new life perspective informs the new work that comprises much of the setlist. World premieres abound: “[Red Headed Woman](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/09/15/roll-of-the-dice-red-headed-woman/),” “[57 Channels (And Nothin’ On)](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/05/17/roll-of-the-dice-57-channels-and-nothin-on/),” “[When the Lights Go Out](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/01/23/roll-of-the-dice-when-the-lights-go-out/),” and “[Real World](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/07/25/roll-of-the-dice-real-world/)” all get their very first airings. Intimate performances of “[My Father’s House](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/08/13/roll-of-the-dice-my-fathers-house/),” “[Brilliant Disguise](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/02/06/roll-of-the-dice-brilliant-disguise/)” and “[Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/11/19/roll-of-the-dice-tenth-avenue-freeze-out/)” (which sounds particularly forlorn tonight) take on new life. In the encores, Bonnie Raitt and Jackson Browne join Bruce for “[Highway 61 Revisite](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/11/07/meeting-across-the-river-bruce-springsteen-bob-dylan-and-friends-highway-61-revisited/)d” and a gorgeous rendition of “[Across the Borderline](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/03/26/matr-bruce-springsteen-bonnie-raitt-and-jackson-browne-across-the-borderline/).” This show is available for purchase as an official archive series installment (get it [here](http://live.brucespringsteen.net/live-music/0,14250/Bruce-Springsteen-mp3-flac-download-11-16-1990-The-Christic-Shows-at-The-Shrine-Los-Angeles-CA.html)) and is essential for any Springsteen fan.

**2002:** Bruce tour premieres “[Cadillac Ranch](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/07/23/roll-of-the-dice-cadillac-ranch/)” and plays a rare solo piano “[Incident on 57th Street](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/12/14/roll-of-the-dice-incident-on-57th-street/)” at his Rising show in Greensboro, but it’s his fall during “[Waitin’ on a Sunny Day](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/09/27/roll-of-the-dice-waitin-on-a-sunny-day/)” that almost ends up a literal show-stopper. Bruce stopped a serious fall by a deft save using Max’s drum stand, but the mishap was enough to draw blood, shocking fans who watched Bruce just continue on as if nothing had happened.

**2010:** Bruce releases *The Promise: The Darkness on the Edge of Town Story* box set, featuring a new double-album of previously unreleased songs. That evening, he makes a guest appearance on *Late Night with Jimmy Fallon,* masquerading as “1975 Bruce” to perform “[Whip My Hair](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/09/05/matr-bruce-springsteen-and-jimmy-fallon-whip-my-hair/)” with Fallon (who is masquerading as Neil Young). Once rid of the disguise, Bruce performs “Because the Night” (with Patti Smith’s lyrics) and “[Save My Love](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/07/16/roll-of-the-dice-save-my-love/),” accompanied by Steve, Roy, and The Roots.
