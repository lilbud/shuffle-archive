<p>Okay, so maybe this particular team-up is a bit one-sided: although we can see Bruce playing guitar over Roy Orbison’s shoulder, it’s clear he’s humbled by talent before him and around him.</p>

<p>But come on: who can blame him? “Running Scared” was a showcase for Orbison’s soaring vocals from the get-go, building dramatically over its two-and-a-half minutes (without ever introducing a chorus) to a climax that only Roy could pull off.</p>
<p>In the last few seconds of the 1987 clip above, we can almost see Bruce thinking, “<em>damn… </em>he still has it!” If anything, Roy sounded even more impressive in 1987 than he did in his 1961 original.</p>

<p>Upon its release in the spring of 1961, “Running Scared” became Orbison’s first #1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 and notched the top spot in Canada as well.</p>
<p>Bruce has (wisely) never attempted the song on his own.</p>
