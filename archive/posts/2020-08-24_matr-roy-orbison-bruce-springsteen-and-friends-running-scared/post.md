Okay, so maybe this particular team-up is a bit one-sided: although we can see Bruce playing guitar over Roy Orbison's shoulder, it's clear he's humbled by talent before him and around him.

But come on: who can blame him? "Running Scared" was a showcase for Orbison's soaring vocals from the get-go, building dramatically over its two-and-a-half minutes (without ever introducing a chorus) to a climax that only Roy could pull off.

In the last few seconds of the 1987 clip above, we can almost see Bruce thinking, "*damn...* he still has it!" If anything, Roy sounded even more impressive in 1987 than he did in his 1961 original.

Upon its release in the spring of 1961, "Running Scared" became Orbison's first #1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 and notched the top spot in Canada as well.

Bruce has (wisely) never attempted the song on his own.
