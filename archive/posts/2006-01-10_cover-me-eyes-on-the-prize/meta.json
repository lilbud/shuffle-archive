There&#8217;s never been a time since the song&#8217;s debut when the fight for equality and justice hasn&#8217;t demanded sacrifice and perseverance from its footsoldiers.</p>\n<p>In the early days of 2006, Bruce Springsteen recorded a version of &#8220;Eyes on the Prize&#8221; (shortening the title) at the last of his three Seeger Sessions. His version starts low and slow, almost a whisper, and builds in power like a movement picking up adherents.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Eyes on the Prize\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/I7lnBLLn7wA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>In an interview for <em>Backstreets,</em> Bruce explained to Dave Marsh: &#8220;So this guy, he&#8217;s in the shadows.

You don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s happening here, my friend.&#8217; And starts to tell you that story&#8230; &#8216;Man you better keep your eyes on the prize, because it&#8217;s coming down.'&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Eyes on the Prize&#8221; builds in power as the story grows in potency. &#8220;Suddenly the guy in the alley is in the street&#8230;&#8221; Bruce continued. &#8220;He&#8217;s surrounded by other people. And other people are picking this secret up, and it&#8217;s turning into not such a secret anymore.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The crowd builds as the song culminates in a Dixieland march and a reminder of what&#8217;s at stake: <em>Ain&#8217;t been to heaven, but I been told, streets up there are paved with gold.</em></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a powerful performance, a story told as much by its arrangement and Bruce&#8217;s vocal performance as by its lyrics. But the song grew more powerful still in concert.</p>\n<p>Yesterday, we listened to Marc Anthony Thompson&#8217;s terrific cover of &#8220;Johnny 99&#8221; and learned how it led to an invitation to join the Sessions Band.</p>\n<p>\u201c[Marc] said he\u2019d be interested in doing some singing,\u201d Bruce told Dave Marsh in a <em>Backstreets </em>interview, \u201cand I said \u2018Well great, come on down!\u2019 And he came down, and it was like, bang!, it was just perfect right away.\u201d</p>\n<p>Their voices blended so well together that Bruce quickly decided to share the center mic with Marc at key points during the show&#8211;the most powerful of which was their nightly performance together of &#8220;Eyes on the Prize.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Eyes on the Prize (Live at the New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival, 2006)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BSrzg2DgFr8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>In a rare interview, Thompson discussed the experience of touring with Bruce.</p>\n<div id=\"v-y1N1q6RO-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='426' src='https://videopress.com/embed/y1N1q6RO?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>Their performances grew in power and potency throughout the tour, and by the end of it Bruce was giving Marc the last word.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen with the Sessions Band - Eyes on the Prize (Live In Dublin)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qd6J2QF3fJY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Other than a Magic Tour cameo, Thompson hasn&#8217;t performed with Bruce since the end of the way-too-short Seeger Sessions Tour, but he&#8217;s continued to release great music.
