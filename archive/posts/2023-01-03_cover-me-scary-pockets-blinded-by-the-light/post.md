I try to keep a rotating spotlight on fresh new cover artists here, but every once in a while an artist earns a second look.

Today makes the first time I’ve featured a three-peat, however. That’s because Los Angeles-based funk combo Scary Pockets is just darn good, and it seems like every year at this time they gift us with a creative take on one of Bruce Springsteen’s classic songs.

*so*

First, there was their of “,” featuring Darrin Criss on lead vocals back in 2019. Then there was the time Rett Madison fronted of “” last year.

The group tips their hat to Bruce for the original, but it’s clear they take their inspiration from Manfred Mann’s adaptation, which went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1977. And it works perfectly, quickly settling into a irresistible groove.

Scary Pockets is headed out on tour across the U.S. and Canada next month, and with at least three Springsteen songs in their repertoire you might hear a familiar song or two if you catch them in person. Check out their tour schedule .
