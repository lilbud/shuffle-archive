Beats me, but that&#8217;s only one of the mysteries of &#8220;Soul Deep.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The other mystery surrounds Gary U.S. Bonds&#8217; cover on his 1982 <em>On the Line\u00a0</em>album.</p>\n<p>Bruce not only co-produced Bonds&#8217; album (with Steve Van Zandt), he also contributed a whopping <em>seven</em> original songs for it. He contributed his band, too:\u00a0<em>On the Line</em> is an E Street Band album, with Steve, Roy, Clarence, Danny, Max, and Garry playing throughout the entire album.</p>\n<p>And maybe, just maybe&#8230; Bruce contributed even more than that.</p>\n<p>Legend has it that Bruce originally contributed his vocals to his songs as well, but with Bruce approaching his peak of popularity, Columbia Records refused permission to release them. Bruce&#8217;s vocals had to be removed, most notably from &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/02/04/cover-me-gary-u-s-bonds-and-the-e-street-band-angelyne/\">Angelyne</a>,&#8221; which was originally a Springsteen/Bonds duet.</p>\n<p>But Springsteen fans swear that not every trace of Bruce&#8217;s vocals was successfully removed. Despite no credit on the album other than &#8220;producer,&#8221; astute listeners might find Bruce lurking in the background on select tracks. Is he on &#8220;Soul Deep?&#8221; I have my opinion, but take a listen and decide for yourself:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Gary U.S. Bonds - Soul Deep\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zuSZ5xCKjZg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Still can&#8217;t decide?
