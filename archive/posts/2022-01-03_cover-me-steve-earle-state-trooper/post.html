<p>Two years later, he was covering his inspiration on television.</p>
<p>Steve Earle’s <em>Guitar Town</em> was brand new in 1986 and earning both popular and critical acclaim, particularly its Springsteen-inspired <a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/11/28/matr-steve-earle-and-bruce-springsteen-guitar-town/">title track</a>. The song earned him a pair of Grammy nominations, a Top Ten song on the country chart, and an invitation (one of many over the years) to perform on <em>Austin City Limits.</em></p>
<p>In 2004, Earle’s complete ACL performance was finally given an official release on both CD and DVD, and included in both versions is his brooding, menacing cover of Bruce’s 1982 deep cut, “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/12/22/roll-of-the-dice-state-trooper/">State Trooper</a>.”</p>

<p>Earle would go on to cover and perform with Bruce in concert many times over the decades, but this early “State Trooper” performance remains one of his best, a snapshot of a Springsteen-inspired artist just beginning to come into his own.</p>
