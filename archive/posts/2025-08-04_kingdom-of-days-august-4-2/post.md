***New for 2025:** New entry for 1977*

**1977:** Bruce works on “[Racing in the Street](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/10/03/roll-of-the-dice-racing-in-the-street/)” during recording sessions at Atlantic Studios in New York City.

**1978:** Bruce plays in West Virginia for the first and only time, when the Darkness Tour stops at the Charleston Civic Center. This show is notable for more than its location, however: it’s also the very first appearance of a work-in-progress “[Sherry Darling](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/07/06/roll-of-the-dice-sherry-darling/).”

**1991:** Bruce joins The Outcry on stage for five songs (including “[Ain’t That a Shame](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/03/08/meeting-across-the-river-bruce-springsteen-and-beaver-brown-aint-that-a-shame/)” “[People Get Ready,](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/11/28/matr-bruce-springsteen-and-jah-love-one-love-people-get-ready/)” and “[Not Fade Away](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/06/24/cover-me-not-fade-away/)“) at Cheers in Long Branch.

**1992:** Night Eight of eleven at the opening American stand of World Tour 1992 in East Rutherford brings three tour premieres (including “[Red Headed Woman](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/09/15/roll-of-the-dice-red-headed-woman/)” as the opener, “[Growin’ Up](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/09/29/roll-of-the-dice-growin-up/),” and “Because the Night”) and an ultra-rare “[Pony Boy](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/03/01/roll-of-the-dice-cover-me-pony-boy/).”

**1999:** There are still five more nights to go in the opening U.S. stand of the Reunion Tour, but Night Ten will be hard to top: Bruce opens the show with the tour premiere of “[No Surrender](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/11/18/roll-of-the-dice-no-surrender/)” (“[For You](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/01/08/roll-of-the-dice-for-you/)” gets a tour premiere as well), and “[Back in Your Arms](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/11/10/roll-of-the-dice-back-in-your-arms/)” is played for the first time ever.
