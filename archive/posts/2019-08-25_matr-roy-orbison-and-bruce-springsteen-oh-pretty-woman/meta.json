From the instantly recognizable riff to Roy&#8217;s inimitable growl and soaring vocals, &#8220;Oh, Pretty Woman&#8221; topped the charts for three weeks in 1964 and finished in the #4 slot for the year.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Oh, Pretty Woman\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3KFvoDDs0XM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Bruce first covered it in 1987, when he performed it with the original artist himself right after Bruce inducted Orbison into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Bruce spent much of the star-studded performance star-struck&#8211;watch below as Bruce gets a kick out of Roy&#8217;s &#8220;Mercy!&#8221; at around the 1:45 mark and completely forgets the lyrics a minute later.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Roy Orbison &amp; Bruce Springsteen - Oh, Pretty Woman (Live)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/o5mVzoWuF3U?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Bruce kept it together a lot better the next time he took a crack at it, only eight months later at the filming for Orbison&#8217;s classic concert film\u00a0<em>Black &amp; White Night</em>. But in this performance, Bruce stays firmly on backing vocals, stepping to the fore for an extended guitar duet with Roy during the second half of the song.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Roy Orbison - Oh, Pretty Woman (from Black &amp; White Night)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_PLq0_7k1jk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>It took almost twelve more years before we&#8217;d get to hear Bruce play &#8220;Oh, Pretty Woman&#8221; with the E Street Band, but that moment finally came when a fan requested it at Bruce&#8217;s concert in Munich on July 2, 2009. It&#8217;s a loose, fun performance, even if (or especially because) at times it seemed like Bruce might not be able to hold the song together for much longer&#8211;the ending gets particularly hairy. By the end of the song, Bruce is clearly exhilarated from having made it all the way through:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Pretty Woman for Roy Bittan - Munich M\u00fcnchen 02.

Did they make it all the way through? See for yourself:</p>\n<div id=\"v-VZBlxGoe-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='426' src='https://videopress.com/embed/VZBlxGoe?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>But practice makes perfect: just a few weeks later, Bruce decided to give &#8220;Oh, Pretty Woman&#8221; a try\u00a0<em>again</em>. This time, though, he was ready for it&#8211;he had John Fogerty enlisted as a partner and they&#8217;d rehearsed beforehand. So when the moment came on-stage at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame 25th Anniversary Concert, Bruce, John, and the E Street Band rose to the occasion.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s their (finally) perfect cover of Roy Orbison&#8217;s &#8220;Oh, Pretty Woman&#8221; from October 29, 2009:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen w.
