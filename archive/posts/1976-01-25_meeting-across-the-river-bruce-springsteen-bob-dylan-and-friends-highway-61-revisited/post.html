<p>When Bob Dylan released <em>Highway 61 Revisited </em>in 1965, it was the first time he’d recorded with rock musicians–or really, with anything other than his guitar.</p>
<p>So perhaps it’s fitting that each and every one of the five times Bruce performed the album’s title track was in the company of other notable musicians.</p>
<p>From the very first time (two times, actually), performed in an ironically acoustic arrangement with Bonnie Raitt and Jackson Browne at the famous Christic shows in 1990…</p>

<p>…to the third time, with Dylan himself in 1994, when Bruce and Neil Young backed him on guitar during Dylan’s show at the Roseland Ballroom in New York City.</p>

<p>A year later, Bruce performed a particularly hard rocking version in Berlin with Wolfgang Niedecken and his band.</p>

<p>And finally, during the encore of the very last Rising Tour show at Shea Stadium in 2003, Bruce played it with Dylan once again–this time with the E Street Band.</p>

<p>Each performance featured a different arrangement; each outstanding in their own way.</p>
<p>But: none of them had the whistle. IMO, that’s the secret ingredient that made the original so much fun.</p>
<p>Just saying.</p>
