<p><strong>1980: </strong>The original River Tour kicks off at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, with “Born to Run” opening the show for the first time ever. Bruce is clearly a bit rusty, as he forgets the lyrics to his most well-known song. “Thunder Road” is played twice, the first time mid-set and the second as a final encore with Bob Seger.</p>

<p><strong>2005: </strong>While driving his kids to school, Bruce notices on the radio that his favorite local public station is holding a membership drive. The station makes a plea for community support, so Bruce decides to provide it, stopping by the station with his guitar and spending over thirty minutes on-air talking with their music director and playing two songs.  One of them, <a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/06/01/roll-of-the-dice-if-i-should-fall-behind/">“If I Should Fall Behind</a>,” will be released on a promotional CD for pledging members.</p>

<p><strong>2017: </strong>Bruce makes his official Broadway debut when <em>Springsteen on Broadway</em> opens in its first public preview performance at the Walter Kerr Theater in New York City. Bruce dedicates this first show to Tom Petty, who passed away the day before. The show itself is an emotional tour through Bruce’s life and work, stunning those present with its power, poignancy, heart and humor–all of which will grow throughout its long run. I’m in the front row for this historic performance–read my account of the evening in my <em><a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/10/03/where-the-man-was-broadway-october-3-2017/">Where the Band Was report</a></em>. Also in attendance tonight: Little Steven, Bruce’s mom, and Bruce’s sister Pam.</p>

<p><strong>2024: </strong>On social media, Bruce publishes his endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 U.S. presidential election campaign. Although the endorsement itself was unsurprising, the passion and urgency of Bruce’s plea sustains for days through the news cycle.</p>
