<p>Tom McRae and David Ford are each brilliant singer-songwriters in their own right, with a couple dozen albums and EPs between them spanning two decades.</p>
<p>Together, though, they’re a downright delight. Early last month, David and Tom teamed up for a fundraiser to support <a href="https://reverserett.org/">Reverse Rett</a>, an organization dedicated to eliminating Rett Syndrome.</p>
<p>“<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/02/06/roll-of-the-dice-brilliant-disguise/">Brilliant Disguise</a>” lends itself to a duet treatment, but rarely do we get to hear it performed by two men–especially not by two men with chemistry as strong as Tom and David’s.</p>
<p>“I’ve always thought that you and me, we have a relationship that’s much like Bruce and Patti’s,” David quipped just before launching into the song. (The video below omits their pre-song patter.)</p>
<p>“People have said it,” Tom replied. “We’re not the first, we can’t fight it.”</p>
<p>Tongue-in-cheek or not, their performance of “Brilliant Disguise” is confident, comfortable, and terrific.</p>
