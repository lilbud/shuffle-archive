Tom McRae and David Ford are each brilliant singer-songwriters in their own right, with a couple dozen albums and EPs between them spanning two decades.

Together, though, they’re a downright delight. Early last month, David and Tom teamed up for a fundraiser to support [Reverse Rett](https://reverserett.org/), an organization dedicated to eliminating Rett Syndrome.

“[Brilliant Disguise](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/02/06/roll-of-the-dice-brilliant-disguise/)” lends itself to a duet treatment, but rarely do we get to hear it performed by two men–especially not by two men with chemistry as strong as Tom and David’s.

“I’ve always thought that you and me, we have a relationship that’s much like Bruce and Patti’s,” David quipped just before launching into the song. (The video below omits their pre-song patter.)

“People have said it,” Tom replied. “We’re not the first, we can’t fight it.”

Tongue-in-cheek or not, their performance of “Brilliant Disguise” is confident, comfortable, and terrific.
