<p>“Viva Las Vegas” is one of a small collection of covers that Bruce actually recorded in the studio, and it came about in an unusual way.</p>
<p>In 1990, the late, great British magazine <em>New Musical Express</em> produced and released an Elvis Presley tribute album to benefit the Nordoff-Robbins Music Therapy Center. The album, <em>The Last Temptation of Elvis, </em>consisted solely of covers of songs Elvis performed in his movies, and it included such artists as Paul McCartney, The Pogues, Hall and Oates, Robert Plant, and of course Bruce.</p>
<p>Bruce chose “Viva Las Vegas” for his contribution, and it ended up leading off the album.</p>

<p>Bruce recorded “Viva Las Vegas” in September 1989, weeks before he officially put the E Street Band on hiatus, and as such no members of the band appear on the track. (Bob Glaub supplies bass, Ian McLagan keyboard, and Jeff Porcaro on drums.)</p>
<p>Bruce’s version is harder-rocking than Elvis’ original, but it retains the same sense of light-hearted fun.</p>

<p>The track didn’t find wide exposure on its original album, but it got some radio airplay thanks to its headlining spot on a promotional single for the album (with Paul McCartney on the B-side!).</p>
<p>It appeared next in 1992, when Bruce’s cover appeared in the movie <em>Honeymoon in Vegas. </em>(It didn’t make the film’s soundtrack album, though.) In 1993, “Viva Las Vegas” was issued as a promotional single in Spain.</p>
<p>Perhaps capitalizing on its small resurgence, Bruce performed the song a few times on his 1992-1993 tour. Here’s a lovely pro-shot performance from May 1993 at Milton Keynes:</p>

<p>Bruce brought it out a couple more times since (including twice in Las Vegas on the Reunion tour–he both opened and closed the show with it), performing it last in Vegas on the Rising Tour.</p>

<p>It took until 2003 before most fans were able to own the track, however. Late that year, Bruce included it on the bonus disc that accompanied the original issuing of <em>The Essential Bruce Springsteen</em>.</p>
<p>The track received one more release in 2008, when it appeared in the soundtrack of an Elvis documentary. Other than the limited-time 2003 bonus disc, however, “Viva Las Vegas” remains unreleased in Bruce’s own catalog to this day.</p>
