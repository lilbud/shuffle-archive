<p>Sam Cooke’s 1964 classic “Shake” has made many appearances in Bruce’s concerts over the years, but almost always as part of a medley. Other than a couple of bar performances, the only time he’s performed the entire song live in concert was at the tail end of the Wrecking Ball Tour in Kilkenny.</p>

<p>Cooke recorded “Shake” in his very last studio session in November 1964. Tragically, Cook passed away 25 days later, so he never got to see his song become a hit in early 1965.</p>

<p>Although arguably eclipsed over the years by its B-side, the powerful civil rights anthem “A Change Is Gonna Come,” “Shake” is still considered a landmark and influential southern soul classic, particularly due to Otis Redding’s cover shortly after Cooke’s death.</p>
