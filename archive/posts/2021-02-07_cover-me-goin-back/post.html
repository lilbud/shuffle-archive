<p>There’s something about Carole King’s nostalgic “Goin’ Back” that grabs hold of the hearts of musicians in their mid-twenties.</p>

<p>King wrote her nostalgic classic at the age of 24, even though she didn’t release it for another four years.</p>
<p>Goldie was the first artist to record “Goin’ Back,” at the age of 26, but her version strayed too far from King’s lyrics, and she had the song withdrawn after only a few weeks.</p>

<p>That made room for Dusty Springfield’s version. She released her single in 1966 at the age of 27, and it became an international hit (except in the U.S., where it strangely was never released as a single).</p>

<p>The Byrds released a cover of “Goin’ Back” the following year; Roger McGuinn had just turned 25 at the time. Their version peaked at #89 on the Billboard Hot 100.</p>

<p>Why do artists tend to cover “Goin’ Back” at that particular age? Probably because King’s song is about a young adult’s last gasp of rebellion. In her lyrics, we hear her determination to stay young at heart, but it’s tinged with self-knowledge that she’s only delaying the inevitable.</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1975, 26-year-old Bruce Springsteen was riding high for the first time. <em>Born to Run</em> was a smash hit, and he was finally on the road to stardom. The attention was considerable, and Bruce had begun to rebel against it. For years to come, he’d resist playing increasingly larger venues and push back against his increasing hype.</p>
<p>Fame and success came at a cost, and Bruce seemed to intuitively sense he was on the precipice of life changes. And besides, what rock star <em>doesn’t</em> suffer from Peter Pan syndrome at some point?</p>
<p>Maybe that’s why Bruce played “Goin’ Back” throughout his stand at The Roxy that October. He debuted it on October 16th with its songwriter in the audience, and he played it five more times in the next three days.</p>
<p>And then never again.</p>

<p>Bruce’s arrangement was gorgeous and his vocals warm, longing, and impassioned. King must have been impressed.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus: </strong>In his introduction to the song, Bruce acknowledged King and tipped his hat to The Byrds’ version (calling them “my favorite L.A. band, I guess”).</p>
<p>But he also acknowledged one other notable cover by 24-year-old Nils Lofgren. Nils had released his version just six months earlier, and only a few weeks after his future bandmates performed it in L.A., Nils would be singing it himself in the U.K.</p>
