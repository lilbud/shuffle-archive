**2017:** On Night Two in Melbourne, Bruce continues to make subtle political statements by opening with “[American Land](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/01/10/roll-of-the-dice-american-land/).” Surprisingly (given how many times he’s played it) and comically, Bruce completely spaces on how to start “[Waitin’ on a Sunny Day.](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/09/27/roll-of-the-dice-waitin-on-a-sunny-day/)” He and Steve spend about two minutes repeatedly trying to figure it out before the crowd finally takes matters into their own hands. Also making their tour debut tonight: “[Sherry Darling](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/07/06/roll-of-the-dice-sherry-darling/),” “This Hard Land,” “and [Cadillac Ranch](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/07/23/roll-of-the-dice-cadillac-ranch/).”
