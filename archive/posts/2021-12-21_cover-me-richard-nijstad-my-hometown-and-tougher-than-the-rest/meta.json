Because like many of us, Richard found parallels to his own life in Bruce&#8217;s music. In particular, &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/04/09/roll-of-the-dice-my-hometown/\">My Hometown</a>&#8221; resonated because he remembers his stepfather letting him steer his car as young boy, and the lessons he learned from his stepfather he passed on to his own daughters.</p>\n<p>In his tender cover of &#8220;My Hometown&#8221; below, we can feel Richard&#8217;s genuine connection to Bruce&#8217;s lyrics.</p>\n<p>In 2005, Richard&#8217;s life took an unexpected turn: his marriage ended, his family split, and he looked to &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/08/08/roll-of-the-dice-tougher-than-the-rest/\">Tougher Than the Rest</a>&#8221; for the strength he needed to soldier on.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Tougher Than the Rest&#8221; became Richard&#8217;s theme song&#8230; so much so that Bruce&#8217;s words are literally written on his body. (Keep an eye out for them in the video below.)</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Cover: Tougher than the rest \u2018on broadway\u2019- Bruce Springsteen - Richard Nijstad - Lyrics\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rjf4-0eB6IE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Today, Richard is working on his own music, and he hopes to release two songs this year.
