Buffalo gets one of the best and certainly the most surprising shows from the Rising Tour stadium leg at the Darien Lake Performing Arts Center. Bruce opens with the tour premiere of “” and debuts the as-yet-unreleased outtake, “” “” is also tour premiered, and “Leap of Faith” makes a return appearance. By now, it’s apparent to all that Bruce is deliberately unearthing material he hasn’t touched in years (if at all), and when his upcoming compilation album, tracklist is announced, it becomes clear why.
