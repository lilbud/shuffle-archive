***New for 2025:** New entry for 1973, 1977 and 1979; video for 2023*

**1971:** The Bruce Springsteen Band opens for Humble Pie at Asbury Park’s Sunshine In. Peter Frampton is impressed enough by Bruce and the band to offer them a gig opening for Humble Pie around the country, as well as an introduction to their record label. Mystifyingly, Tinker West (Bruce’s manager at the time) declines the offers.

**2008:** It’s Christmas in July when Bruce honors one last sign request when the Magic Tour stops in Helsinki: “[Santa Claus is Comin’ to Town](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/12/24/cover-me-santa-claus-is-comin-to-town/)” is the second to last song of the night.

**2009:** Jake Clemons makes his debut on an E Street Band stage when he guest-stars on sax during “[Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/11/19/roll-of-the-dice-tenth-avenue-freeze-out/)” as the Working on a Dream Tour stops for the first of two nights at RDS Arena in Dublin. (How strange to see him next to Clarence–the intersection of E Street Past and Present!) Bruce’s son Evan joins the band as well, playing acoustic guitar on “[American Land](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/01/10/roll-of-the-dice-american-land/).” Tour debuting tonight: “[You Can Look (But You Better Not Touch)](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/06/14/roll-of-the-dice-you-can-look-but-you-better-not-touch/).”

**2016:** A wild night in Paris for the first of two shows on the River Tour (2016 Edition). Bruce opens with a solo piano “[Incident on 57th Street](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/12/14/roll-of-the-dice-incident-on-57th-street/)” followed by the tour premiere of “[Reason to Believe](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/02/27/roll-of-the-dice-reason-to-believe/).” “Into the Fire” and “[Nebraska](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/04/16/roll-of-the-dice-nebraska/)” receive tour premieres as well. Elliott and Gaspard Murphy make a customary guest appearance during the encores, but during “[Ramrod](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/09/10/roll-of-the-dice-ramrod/),” the power goes out and Bruce finishes the song mic-less before taking a break until the power is restored.
