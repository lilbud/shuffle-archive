This time, John and Bruce traded lead vocals, backed by a band that included Robbie Robertson, Don Was, Roy Bittan, and Benmont Tench of The Heartbreakers. Bruce brought his full-throated growl to match Fogerty&#8217;s powerful voices, and the result was smoking.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"John Fogerty with Bruce Springsteen &amp; Robbie Robertson - &quot;Born On The Bayou&quot; | 1993 Inductions\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pfn4G2IJUxA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> Bruce and John performed &#8220;Born on the Bayou&#8221; once more together&#8211;two years later at John&#8217;s 50th birthday party at John&#8217;s house in Beverly Hills.
