His intent was to pique his students&#8217; interest in the war, but he deepened his own fascination along the way.</p>\n<p>Because to this teacher, it wasn&#8217;t just history. It was <em>his</em> history.</p>\n<p>The son of a preacher, John Grushecky was drafted into the U.S. Army and participated in the Invasion of Normandy, the Battle of the Bulge, and the Liberation of Paris.\u00a0 He earned a Purple Heart and Silver Star for his service to his country, and one day while on furlough he met Mildred, the woman he would marry.</p>\n<p>Fifty years later, their son realized that while he knew bits and pieces of how they&#8217;d met, he didn&#8217;t know the whole story. So Joe Grushecky decided to interview his parents, who retold their history to their son.</p>\n<p>He started capturing their story but soon found himself chronicling it in song&#8211;because Joe wasn&#8217;t just a teacher, he was also an accomplished rock and roll singer, songwriter and bandleader.</p>\n<p>Joe wrote a beautiful and moving ballad about his father&#8217;s wartime experience and his parents&#8217; romance, and he framed it through the lens of the pivotal year when they were reunited and peace was restored to the world.</p>\n<p>There was only one problem: he couldn&#8217;t figure out what to do with the chorus. He&#8217;d written the lyrics, but he couldn&#8217;t find the right music to pair them with.</p>\n<p>He was stuck.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, Joe had a friend to turn to&#8211;a friend who was also the producer of Joe&#8217;s work-in-progress album and a singer-songwriter of some renown himself.</p>\n<p>During a lull in the\u00a0<em><a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/10/17/american-babylon-a-retrospective/\">American Babylon</a>\u00a0</em>recording sessions, Joe played his mostly complete song for his friend Bruce Springsteen and asked for a musical assist to finish it. Bruce obliged and supplied the music for the chorus, and with that last ingredient Joe finished &#8220;1945,&#8221; the sweet, romantic and true story of John and Mildred Grushecky.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"1945\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/AFxZXjSCsgg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;Practically every word is true,&#8221; Joe told me.</p>\n<p>Even the music contributes to their story, especially Jamie Peck&#8217;s Glen Miller-esque saxophone outro. (John Grushecky was a sax player in the Army band.) &#8220;1945&#8221; is one of Joe&#8217;s most skillfully and delicately arranged tracks, as cinematic as any of Bruce&#8217;s own songs.</p>\n<p>Bruce doesn&#8217;t appear on the studio track, and he&#8217;s never performed it with Joe. But his assist helped his friend keep his parents alive and young forever in song.</p>\n<p><strong>1945<br />\nReleased:</strong>\u00a0<em>Coming Home</em> (1998)<br />\n<strong>Never
