<p>Bruce’s shortest-lived band, Dr. Zoom and the Sonic Boom lasted all of two gigs, but it’s not hard to hear glimmers of the future E Street Band: Bruce, Stevie, Garry, Vini, and David Sancious are already present, and while the Big Man hadn’t yet made the scene, there are saxophones (two) in the house.</p>
<p>On stage, there were almost as many backup singers as musicians, and while you’re picturing that assemblage while you listen to this performance,  add to your mental vision an on-stage Monopoly game and baton twirler (seriously), and you’ll pretty much have the scene captured.</p>
<p>(Note: I realize that this song was originally recorded by The Shirelles in 1960, but this arrangement is far more similar to Carole King’s version on <em>Tapestry</em>. Given that <em>Tapestry </em>was released in February 1971, just a few months before this Dr. Zoom performance, I’m inclined to think that Bruce had Carole’s version in mind rather than the original Shirelles recording. And since Carole also co-wrote the song, I’m crediting this cover to her.)</p>
