That recording has never surfaced (or has it? Keep reading).</li>\n<li>Bruce gifted the song to Gary U.S. Bonds for his third album. It ended up serving as the title track.</li>\n<li>Bruce and Steve co-produced the album with Bonds, so they had a very strong hand in the final product.</li>\n<li>The backing musicians for the album included Bruce, Steve, Roy, Clarence, Danny, Garry, and Max&#8211;in other words, the entire E Street Band. Several other musicians contributed their talents as well.</li>\n<li>When you listen to &#8220;Dedication&#8221; specifically, the band sure sounds an like pure E Street. Give it a listen:</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Gary US Bonds - Dedication - RARE!!  &#039;&#039;Rockin&#039; Tune&#039;&#039;\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0WMWIzIBd8k?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8230;so the reason why I question if this is really a cover:</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s entirely possible and very probable that what we&#8217;re listening to is truly Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band&#8211;just with Bonds on vocals instead of Bruce.</p>\n<p>In fact&#8211;it&#8217;s even possible that this is the very same studio recording from those original River Sessions, with Bonds simply recording his vocals over the instrumental track. (If anyone knows for sure, I&#8217;d love to know.)</p>\n<p>Anyway, let&#8217;s check out the song, because it&#8217;s pretty darn great and a whole lot of fun. I&#8217;m genuinely surprised Bruce doesn&#8217;t pull it out from time to time.</p>\n<p>This is Bruce in pure pop mode, using historical vignettes in clever comparison to his romantic promises:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Well way back, baby, in the Bible time</em><br />\n<em>A cat named Noah built an ocean liner</em><br />\n<em>Everybody laughed when he told them why</em><br />\n<em>But when the rain came, Noah, he was high and dry</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>&#8216;Cause he had dedication, baby, through and through</em><br />\n<em>Dedication like I give to you</em><br />\n<em>Dedication, girl, every way</em><br />\n<em>Dedication, girl, every day</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Well Admiral Byrd and some Eskimos</em><br />\n<em>They took a little trip to the old North Pole</em><br />\n<em>Well they said it was a miracle when they made it back</em><br />\n<em>But he said that wasn&#8217;t any miracle, Jack</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Man, it took dedication baby through and through</em><br />\n<em>Dedication like I give to you</em><br />\n<em>Dedication, girl, in every way</em><br />\n<em>Dedication, girl, every day</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Well now there was a movie star out in Hollywood</em><br />\n<em>He met a little girl, they got along real good</em><br />\n<em>He tried to split but the chick she told him, &#8220;Not so fast</em><br />\n<em>Ain&#8217;t gonna wrap me in your arms, then wrap me in some cash&#8221;</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Now it was on TV, every word they said</em><br />\n<em>If you didn&#8217;t see it, man, you must have been dead</em><br />\n<em>She got on the witness stand, sighed without a care</em><br />\n<em>She turned to the judge and this is what she said:</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>I gave him dedication, judge, every day</em><br />\n<em>Dedication, judge, in every way</em><br />\n<em>I need some dedication, judge, that can be spent</em><br />\n<em>A little dedication, judge, to pay the rent</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Dedication baby through and through</em><br />\n<em>Dedication like I give to you</em><br />\n<em>Dedication, girl, every way</em><br />\n<em>Dedication, girl, every day</em></p>\n<p>They&#8217;re not Bruce&#8217;s deepest lyrics, but they would have been right at home on\u00a0<em>The River\u00a0</em>alongside a song like &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/07/06/roll-of-the-dice-sherry-darling/\">Sherry Darling</a>.&#8221; (The two songs even share similar &#8220;frat rock&#8221; introductions.)</p>\n<p>&#8220;Dedication&#8221; would surely be a highlight any time Bruce chooses to play it, but in all these years, he&#8217;s only played it once&#8211;with Bonds at the Cafe Bar in Long Branch, NJ, in the summer of 1989. No audio is known to exist of it, but here&#8217;s a pro-shot recording of Bonds performing it live in 1981:</p>\n<div id=\"v-SsZa33Wh-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='568' src='https://videopress.com/embed/SsZa33Wh?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p><strong>Dedication<br />\nRecorded:</strong> June-August 1980 (vocals&#8211;possibly using a December 1979 instrumental track)<br />\n<strong>Released:</strong> Dedication (1981)<br />\n<strong>First performed</strong> (by Bruce): July 2, 1989 (Long Branch, NJ)<br />\n<strong>Last performed</strong> (by Bruce): July 2, 1989 (Long Branch, NJ)</p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
