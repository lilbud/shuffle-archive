***New for 2025:** New entry for 1982*

**1976:** Laurel Canyon sends Bruce a royalty check for $67,000, but an auditor determines it should have been for $2,000,000, ramping up a legal battle that will keep Bruce out of the studio for some time to come. In the meantime, Bruce and the E Street Band bring the Chicken Scratch Tour to New Orleans for a single show at the Municipal Auditorium. This show features Bruce's first performance of Gary U.S. Bonds' "[New Orleans](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/07/31/cover-me-new-orleans/)" and one of the longest-ever performances of "[It's Hard to Be a Saint in the City](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/10/21/roll-of-the-dice-its-hard-to-be-a-saint-in-the-city/)."

**1977:** When Southside Johnny takes ill and can't perform, Steve Van Zandt transforms his Red Bank show into The Asbury Park All-Star Revue, featuring the Jukes, Bruce and the E Street Band, and Ronnie Spector. Steve performs lead vocals for most of the show, with Bruce on guitar and backing vocals, but Bruce steps up to the mic when the super-band plays his own songs. The Revue plays two shows on this night, and you can hear them both below.
