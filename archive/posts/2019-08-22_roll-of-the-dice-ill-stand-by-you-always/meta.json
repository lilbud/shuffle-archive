It&#8217;s a tighter, shorter, and much better mix, with new (or at least different) vocals than the leaked demo. From a musical standpoint, it&#8217;s a lot more listenable.

I know it&#8217;s just a parody, but I kinda dig it.</p>\n<p>As for the <em>actual</em> song Bruce wrote for Harry Potter&#8230; um, I think I&#8217;ll just let Bruce do the talking on this one:</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p04cjymy/player\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Yep, it&#8217;s true: Bruce really did write a Harry Potter song.</p>\n<p>And yes: it&#8217;s uncharacteristic of something Bruce would ordinarily sing.</p>\n<p>But is it good? Bruce sure seems to think so. And Chris Columbus, the director for <em>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#8217;s Stone,\u00a0</em>calls it &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.backstreets.com/columbus.html\">one of the best songs he&#8217;d ever written</a>.&#8221;\u00a0Me? Well, I must not be in the target demographic.</p>\n<p>But because I&#8217;m an obsessive completist, let&#8217;s break it down:</p>\n<div id=\"v-DfGqCrxF-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='426' src='https://videopress.com/embed/DfGqCrxF?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>Musically, &#8220;I&#8217;ll Stand By You&#8221; has a soft, easy-listening vibe&#8211;kind of like &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/03/02/roll-of-the-dice-lets-be-friends-skin-to-skin/\">Let&#8217;s Be Friends (Skin to Skin)</a>&#8221; but without the soul groove. To my ears, it&#8217;s flat and lifeless&#8211;almost the audio equivalent of stock photography.</p>\n<p>Lyrically, well&#8230;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>You wake me in the night and your tears falling down, come let me dry them for you</em><br />\n<em>I wish I could tell a story, chase away all those ghosts you&#8217;ve got inside of you</em><br />\n<em>A story of heroes that fight on at any cost of a kingdom of love to be won or lost</em><br />\n<em>We&#8217;ll fight here together &#8217;til victory is won, come take my hand &#8217;til the morning comes</em><br />\n<em>Just close your eyes&#8230;</em></p>\n<p>Yeah, I get the allusions to a make-believe world, but the references to ghosts sound a bit forced, and the references to heroes fighting at any cost and a &#8220;&#8216;kingdom of love&#8221; make me wonder if Bruce had actually even read the books.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>I&#8217;ll stand by you always, always, always</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;ll stand by you always, always, always</em></p>\n<p>The chorus is lovely enough, though. It&#8217;s just too bad about those verses&#8230;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>I know here in the dark, tomorrow can seem so very far away</em><br />\n<em>Here the ghosts and the goblins can rise from your dreams to steal your heart away</em><br />\n<em>Together we&#8217;ll chase those thieves that won&#8217;t leave you alone out from under the bed, out from over our home</em><br />\n<em>And when the light comes we&#8217;ll laugh my love about the things that the night had us so frightened of</em><br />\n<em>And until then&#8230;</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>I&#8217;ll stand by you always, always, always</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;ll stand by you always, always, always</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Now I know it can feel like you&#8217;re slipping away, at night you&#8217;ll get lost in that deep dark place</em><br />\n<em>We&#8217;ll let the night come and do what it may, together we&#8217;ll find the courage, we&#8217;ll find faith</em><br />\n<em>Until you awake&#8230;</em></p>\n<p>Also: that bridge. Ouch. So of course he repeats it.</p>\n<p>I hate being negative, and I really do have to give props to Bruce for writing an unsolicited Harry Potter song to delight his son. Seriously, that&#8217;s a superhero dad move right there.</p>\n<p>But this isn&#8217;t Bruce anywhere near his best, and for me, this song is waaaaaay down at the bottom of my ranking list (Sorry, Chris). So to all my friends who swear I&#8217;ve never met a Bruce song I didn&#8217;t like: here you go.</p>\n<p>To date, Bruce has never performed &#8220;I&#8217;ll Stand By You&#8221; in concert.</p>\n<p>Please, for the love of Clarence: nobody bring a sign.</p>\n<p><strong>I&#8217;ll Stand By You</strong><br />\n<strong>Recorded:</strong> 2001<br />\n<strong>Released:\u00a0</strong><em>Blinded by the Light (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)\u00a0</em>(2019)<br />\n<strong>Never performed</strong></p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
