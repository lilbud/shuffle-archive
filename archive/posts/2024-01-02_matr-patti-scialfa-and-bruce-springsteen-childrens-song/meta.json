Turlington personally recruited the artists&#8211;all women&#8211;who contributed to the album.</p>\n<p>One of those artists was Patti Scialfa. Patti readily agreed to participate, but she had trouble finding the right song until Bruce reminded her of a song she&#8217;d written years before when their children were young. Patti liked the idea, but she wasn&#8217;t overly fond of the way she sounded singing it, so she rewrote it to her comfort.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Children&#8217;s Song&#8221; eventually made it onto the album, but not before Patti and Bruce worked through some creative tension around it.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe had both versions and I kept pushing for the new one,&#8221; Patti told <em>Rolling Stone </em>in 2011, &#8220;and Bruce kept pushing for the one that ended up on the record. I kept saying, \u2018I just don\u2019t sing it that well.\u2019 And he said, \u2018Run the tape, I\u2019ll sing it.\u2019 He sang the whole song and it really suited him just perfectly.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ultimately, Patti and Bruce recorded the song as a duet, tapping Ron Aniello for production duty during the <em><a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2023/03/28/album-companion-wrecking-ball/\">Wrecking Ball</a>\u00a0</em>sessions. While that may technically have violated the &#8220;mothers only&#8221; rule for the album, the gentle, parental benediction turned out too lovely to keep in the vault.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Patti Scialfa - Children&#039;s Song\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XndDKzxj9xs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Bruce&#8217;s participation might have drawn more attention (and therefore sales) to the project, but Bruce, Patti, and Christy agreed to keep Bruce&#8217;s name off the credits to better support the album&#8217;s theme.</p>\n<p><em>Every Mother Counts </em>was available for sale exclusively in Starbucks stores (the Seattle-based coffee company was the\u00a0 project&#8217;s sponsor) for a mere 28 days. Even with such a brief on-sale window and limited retail outlets, the album debuted at #83 on the Billboard album chart and spawned a follow-up project the following year.</p>\n<p>If you managed to snap up one of those rare original CDs, congratulations on scoring one of the more elusive original Springsteen recordings and for supporting an important cause&#8211;eight dollars of your purchase went toward helping make pregnancy and childbirth safe for women everywhere.</p>\n<p><strong>Children&#8217;s Song<br />\nRecorded:</strong> 2011<br />\n<strong>Released:</strong>\u00a0<em>Every Mother Counts</em> (2011)<br />\n<strong>Never performed</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>A little marital creative tension and an uncredited duet vocal resulted in one of the loveliest but rarest Springsteen/Scialfa recordings&#8211;all for an important cause. </p>\n", "protected": false}, "author": 1, "featured_media": 21395, "comment_status": "open", "ping_status": "open", "sticky": false, "template": "", "format": "standard", "meta": {"_monsterinsights_skip_tracking": false, "_monsterinsights_sitenote_active": false, "_monsterinsights_sitenote_note": "", "_monsterinsights_sitenote_category": 0, "jetpack_post_was_ever_published": false, "_jetpack_newsletter_access": "", "_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs": false, "_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id": 0, "_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content": false, "_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content": false, "footnotes": "", "jetpack_publicize_message": "", "jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled": true, "jetpack_social_post_already_shared": true, "jetpack_social_options": {"image_generator_settings": {"template": "highway", "default_image_id": 0, "font": "", "enabled": false}, "version": 2}}, "categories": [4, 5], "tags": [2897, 2898, 115], "class_list": ["post-21390", "post", "type-post", "status-publish", "format-standard", "has-post-thumbnail", "hentry", "category-cover-me", "category-meeting-across-the-river", "tag-childrens-song", "tag-every-mother-counts", "tag-patti-scialfa"], "aioseo_notices": [], "jetpack_publicize_connections": [], "jetpack_featured_media_url": "https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/everymother.jpg?fit=600%2C600&ssl=1", "jetpack_sharing_enabled": true, "jetpack_shortlink": "https://wp.me/p9w3Lk-5z0", "jetpack_likes_enabled": true, "jetpack-related-posts": [{"id": 4776, "url": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/10/02/meeting-across-the-river-patti-scialfa-and-bruce-springsteen-as-long-as-i-can-be-with-you/", "url_meta": {"origin": 21390, "position": 0}, "title": "Meeting Across the River: Patti Scialfa and Bruce Springsteen, As Long As I (Can Be With You)", "author": "Ken", "date": "October 2, 2018", "format": false, "excerpt": "Spotlight on Patti Scialfa today, and her wonderful Rumble Doll single, \"As Long as I Can Be With You.\" Check out the rare performance (with Bruce on backup) inside.", "rel": "", "context": "In &quot;Meeting Across the River&quot;", "block_context": {"text": "Meeting Across the River", "link": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/category/meeting-across-the-river/"}, "img": {"alt_text": "", "src": "https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/aslong-e1538089070304.jpg?fit=600%2C338&ssl=1&resize=350%2C200", "width": 350, "height": 200, "srcset": "https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/aslong-e1538089070304.jpg?fit=600%2C338&ssl=1&resize=350%2C200 1x, https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/aslong-e1538089070304.jpg?fit=600%2C338&ssl=1&resize=525%2C300 1.5x"}, "classes": []}, {"id": 1225, "url": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/03/21/meeting-across-the-river-patti-scialfa-and-bruce-springsteen-rose/", "url_meta": {"origin": 21390, "position": 1}, "title": "Meeting Across the River: Patti Scialfa and Bruce Springsteen, &#8220;Rose&#8221;", "author": "Ken", "date": "March 21, 2018", "format": false, "excerpt": "Spotlight on Patti today, as Bruce backs her on one of her earliest songs.
