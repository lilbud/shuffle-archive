<p>It amazes me that Bruce has only covered this once, at Light of Day 2014–this would be an instant highlight at an E Street Band concert.</p>
<p>For now, though, we’ll have to be content with Bruce and Jesse Malin teaming up for The Ramones’ “Do You Remember Rock’n’Roll Radio?”</p>

<p>Here’s the original for good measure–because there’s no such thing as too much airplay for the classics.</p>
