***New for 2025:** Audio for 1975*

**1969:** Child plays their last of six consecutive nights at the Pandemonium in Wanamassa, New Jersey. On this night, however, the band isn't the center of attention: during Bruce's performance, Neil Armstrong lands and walks on the moon. That's tough for anyone to compete with, and the band takes issue with the distracting televisions placed around the club. They won't play this club again.

**1973:** Bruce and the E Street band play their third of six consecutive two-shows-nightly gigs at Max's Kansas City in New York, with the Wailers as the opening act.

**1975:** A red-letter (and red-eyed) day for Bruce and the E Street Band: after a marathon nineteen-hour rehearsal that ends at 3am, and after recording work on "Jungleland" that continued until 10am, the band races to the Palace Theater in Providence, Rhode Island, for the opening night of the Born to Run Tour and Steven Van Zandt's debut as a member of the E Street Band.
