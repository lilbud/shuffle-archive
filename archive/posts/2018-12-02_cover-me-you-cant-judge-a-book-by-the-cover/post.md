It's rare for Bruce to include a cover song on a studio album, but it's been known to happen.

He did it most recently on *Chapter & Verse*, where he spotlighted his earliest (officially released) cover: Bo Diddley's "You Can't Judge a Book by the Cover."

Ouch. Sounds rough, doesn't it?

That's because it's not a studio recording, obviously; its a live performance by Bruce's original band, The Castiles, way back in 1967 in a club called The Left Foot in Bruce's hometown of Freehold, New Jersey.

So we'll forgive not-quite-eighteen-year-old Bruce for not realizing he'd want to release that performance as part of a career spanning retrospective someday. If the vocals are muddy, we can always turn to the original 1962 hit by Bo Diddley:

A bit slower than Bo Diddley's typical beat, "You Can't Judge the Book by the Cover" nevertheless became a hit (one of his last), peaking at #21 on the R&B chart and #48 on the Hot 100. Given Bruce's affinity for both Bo Diddley and metaphor-laden lyrics, it's not surprising to discover this song among Bruce's earliest cover performances.

The Castiles sped it up a bit and left off Bo Diddley's ad lib flourishes, and the result is a respectful cover by a very young band with a lot of potential.
