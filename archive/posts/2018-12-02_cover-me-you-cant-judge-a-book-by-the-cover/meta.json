Sounds rough, doesn&#8217;t it?</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s because it&#8217;s not a studio recording, obviously; its a live performance by Bruce&#8217;s original band, The Castiles, way back in 1967 in a club called The Left Foot in Bruce&#8217;s hometown of Freehold, New Jersey.</p>\n<p>So we&#8217;ll forgive not-quite-eighteen-year-old Bruce for not realizing he&#8217;d want to release that performance as part of a career spanning retrospective someday. If the vocals are muddy, we can always turn to the original 1962 hit by Bo Diddley:</p>\n<p>https://youtu.be/Lch0o4wwGyw</p>\n<p>A bit slower than Bo Diddley&#8217;s typical beat, &#8220;You Can&#8217;t Judge the Book by the Cover&#8221; nevertheless became a hit (one of his last), peaking at #21 on the R&amp;B chart and #48 on the Hot 100. Given Bruce&#8217;s affinity for both Bo Diddley and metaphor-laden lyrics, it&#8217;s not surprising to discover this song among Bruce&#8217;s earliest cover performances.</p>\n<p>The Castiles sped it up a bit and left off Bo Diddley&#8217;s ad lib flourishes, and the result is a respectful cover by a very young band with a lot of potential.</p>\n<p><strong>You Can&#8217;t Judge a Book by the
