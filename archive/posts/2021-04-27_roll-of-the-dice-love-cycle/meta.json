It appears very late in Bruce&#8217;s 1968 notebook, suggesting that it dates to the final months of that year&#8211;very possibly an early or abandoned version that gave rise to &#8220;My Lady&#8221; instead.</p>\n<p>Bruce&#8217;s &#8220;Love Cycle&#8221; stanzas are relatively polished, suggesting he was transcribing rather than writing&#8211;at least at first. There&#8217;s a notable departure on the second page where Bruce seems inspired to riff on his circus theme, branching off to page three for the complete middle section.</p>\n<p><img

Springsteenlyrics.com, we have a clean transcription of Bruce&#8217;s writing to analyze.</p>\n<p>The title gives us the only clue we need to unlock Bruce&#8217;s intent: &#8220;Love Cycle&#8221; traces the course of love through one&#8217;s life, beginning with the sudden onrush that envelops new parents and binds them.</p>\n<p>Actually, that&#8217;s not quite right&#8211;we begin with the suggestion of death in the form of a lost feather; only after it completes its fall do we greet the day with new life.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>The listless feather drifts upon the wind</em><br />\n<em>Casts a wounded refuge from the night&#8217;s severed wing,</em><br />\n<em>Down, down, tumbling down,</em><br />\n<em>Unto your hand she lies,</em><br />\n<em>To kiss the blessed skin and then to die</em><br />\n<em>In the morning when I rise</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>The silence of dawn is broken by a new child&#8217;s cry</em><br />\n<em>A young girl slowly smiles as the sun breaks the sky</em><br />\n<em>I find myself sinking into her gentle eyes</em><br />\n<em>And my blood flows so wild</em><br />\n<em>Through the rivers of her mind,</em><br />\n<em>In the morning when I rise</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>A morning star glows with kindness</em><br />\n<em>As she brings the child down by the sea</em><br />\n<em>To be christened</em><br />\n<em>Amidst the onrushing tide</em><br />\n<em>Tiny crystals of salt water</em><br />\n<em>Trickle down the newborn face</em><br />\n<em>And I stand beside her</em><br />\n<em>And taste the sweetened taste</em><br />\n<em>Of a love we had one young sea morning</em></p>\n<p>The middle section is intentionally simpler. It evokes a simpler time when our lovers&#8217; bond was new and responsibilities few. Bruce perhaps extends the circus metaphor a bit too far, but it&#8217;s clear he does so in order to convey that while his characters may be young adults, they haven&#8217;t fully left carefree childhood behind.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Twisted roots of a torn oak tree</em><br />\n<em>Bend and wind together as you and me</em><br />\n<em>Then break upon the earth</em><br />\n<em>Molded tightly into one to receive</em><br />\n<em>The honeyed kisses of the golden sun</em><br />\n<em>Remember when we were young</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Remember when we were young</em><br />\n<em>When we were young</em><br />\n<em>Through the park we would run</em><br />\n<em>When we were young</em><br />\n<em>Just to sit and watch the day</em><br />\n<em>When we were young</em><br />\n<em>Maybe catch the circus parade</em><br />\n<em>When we were young</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Come into my circus tent</em><br />\n<em>See the lions and elephants</em><br />\n<em>Watch the silly clowns at play</em><br />\n<em>Come at night and stay all day</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>See the lion tamer crack the sky</em><br />\n<em>With the tip of his lash</em><br />\n<em>Watch the man on the flying trapeze</em><br />\n<em>As he swings so gracefully undaunted</em></p>\n<p>In the final section of &#8220;Love Cycle,&#8221; our lovers age to and through adulthood, flashing forward to old age. Bruce hasn&#8217;t yet honed his talent for subtlety, resorting instead to on-the-nose imagery like a grandfather clock, rocking chair, and gray-haired children.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Standing in an open doorway</em><br />\n<em>Hands reaching out to touch the rain</em><br />\n<em>Forever, that have been weary</em><br />\n<em>Now begin to change</em><br />\n<em>Knowing things shall never be the same</em><br />\n<em>Tainted blue coolness of a misty night</em><br />\n<em>As we stood under the sheltering tree</em><br />\n<em>Everything seemed so right</em><br />\n<em>With your smile</em><br />\n<em>I became lost in love and life</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>And within the heart of a grandfather clock</em><br />\n<em>Gray haired children cease to sing</em><br />\n<em>The worn out rocking chair</em><br />\n<em>And the raven flies the morning so tired</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>We sat with dreams of the sun</em><br />\n<em>When we were young we sang the songs</em><br />\n<em>That had to be sung when we were young</em><br />\n<em>We did the things that had to be done</em><br />\n<em>When we were young</em><br />\n<em>Worked and loved together as one when we were one</em><br />\n<em>Remember when we were young</em></p>\n<p>The final lines of &#8220;Love Cycle&#8221; fulfill the promise of Bruce&#8217;s title: although Bruce doesn&#8217;t (and doesn&#8217;t need to) state as much, the raven will no doubt lose a feather that tired morning, suggesting that our narrator has reached the end of his journey with a new life somewhere ready to begin.</p>\n<p>Explore more entries from Bruce&#8217;s 1968 notebook <a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/?s=1968+notebook\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Love Cycle<br />\nNever recorded</strong><br />\n<strong>Never released</strong><br />\n<strong>Never performed</strong></p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
