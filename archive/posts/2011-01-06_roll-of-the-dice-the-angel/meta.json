Originally self-touted as one of his best songs (there was never a point at which &#8220;The Angel&#8221; wasn&#8217;t a contender for his first album), Bruce has played it in public only three times across five decades. Even &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/05/12/roll-of-the-dice-mary-queen-of-arkansas/\">Mary, Queen of Arkansas</a>&#8221; has had five times as many outings as &#8220;The Angel.&#8221;</p>\n<p>And yet, &#8220;The Angel&#8221; is a genuinely significant song. If we want to chart the songwriting path that led Bruce to his landmark &#8220;Born to Run,&#8221; we start way back in the autumn of 1971, when Bruce auditioned for future manager Mike Appel with &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/10/13/roll-of-the-dice-baby-doll/\">Baby Doll</a>,&#8221; and &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/04/10/roll-of-the-dice-song-for-orphans/\">Song for Orphans</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Appel thought both songs sucked, but he saw enough potential in Bruce to challenge him to write more songs and then come back and see him again. Bruce accepted the challenge and wrote furiously over the weeks and months that followed. He reported back to Appel in February 1972, and although &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/10/21/roll-of-the-dice-its-hard-to-be-a-saint-in-the-city/\">It&#8217;s Hard to Be a Saint in the City</a>&#8221; is the song that famously captivated Appel enough to take Bruce on as a client, Bruce demoed at least seven other songs for Appel that day, two of which would make it onto Bruce&#8217;s first album. One of them was &#8220;The Angel.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;The Angel&#8221; was also one of a dozen songs that Bruce recorded for John Hammond the day after Appel famously bulldogged him into auditioning Bruce in May of 1972.\u00a0 Amazingly, that early recording of &#8220;The Angel&#8221; survives, and although Bruce&#8217;s solo piano performance can&#8217;t compete with the more confident yet delicate David Sancious performance that graces the official track, there&#8217;s no question that Bruce&#8217;s make-or-break vocal for Hammond is far superior to the final version.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce performs &quot;The Angel&quot; as a demo for John Hamm\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DKDw27S88F8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Hammond signed Bruce to CBS\u00a0 shortly after that, on June 9, 1972.\u00a0 Within three weeks, Bruce had reassembled The Bruce Springsteen Band (minus Steve Van Zandt, still a couple of years away from re-entering the story) and started recording his debut album.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The Angel&#8221; was one of the first songs they recorded, in an arrangement that&#8217;s essentially a solo Sancious performance. (Richard Davis, who played on Van Morrison&#8217;s\u00a0<em>Astral Weeks\u00a0</em>album that Bruce revered, accompanied Sancious on the upright double bass late in the song. Davis would reprise his double bass duty on &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/08/04/roll-of-the-dice-meeting-across-the-river/\">Meeting Across the River</a>&#8221; for Bruce&#8217;s third album.)</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"The Angel\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/s-pdQKRQ_qY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>In the early 1970s, Bruce had a fascination with seamy street scenes and sordid characters; several of his songs from that pre-label period were little more than the musical equivalent of a mural, or at best a character study. (See &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/01/09/roll-of-the-dice-hollywood-kids/\">Hollywood Kids,</a>&#8221; for example.)</p>\n<p>&#8220;The Angel&#8221; is very much in this vein, a portrait rather than a story, about a Hell&#8217;s Angel biker whose bravado may mask some inner insecurity.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>The angel rides with hunchback children</em><br />\n<em>Poison oozing from his engine</em><br />\n<em>Wieldin&#8217; love as a lethal weapon</em><br />\n<em>On his way to Hubcap Heaven</em><br />\n<em>Baseball cards poked in his spokes</em><br />\n<em>His boots in oil he&#8217;s patiently soaked</em><br />\n<em>The roadside attendant nervously jokes</em><br />\n<em>As the angel&#8217;s tires stroke his precious pavement</em></p>\n<p>&#8220;The Angel&#8221; is often derided as at best pretentious, at worst as crude. But there&#8217;s much to admire and appreciate here as well; Bruce isn&#8217;t altogether wrong when he deemed it one of his more sophisticated songs.</p>\n<p>Bruce&#8217;s melody is contemplatively sad, almost poignant&#8211;at contrast with his easy riding protagonist. As for the Angel himself, it&#8217;s clear that Bruce is taken with the idea that such an innocent appellation could apply to such a menacing\u00a0 character. That irony is the central conceit of the song, and it really is a sophisticated notion for a 22-year-old songwriter.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The Angel&#8221; is about a man who fancies himself as threatening, but there&#8217;s an innocence about him as well that Bruce momentarily reveals when he notes the baseball cards in the cycle&#8217;s spokes, as if the biker was a child on a paper route rather than on his way to Hubcap Heaven.</p>\n<p>(Hubcap Heaven, by the way, was and is a real place that Bruce was very much familiar with. Officially, it&#8217;s called the Hubcap Farm, and you can find it in Farmingdale, New Jersey. For all the fans who devote hours of research, exploration, and debate to determining the location of Greasy Lake, Hubcap Heaven is a surprisingly easy yet little-known Springsteen landmark to visit.)</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"The Hubcap Heaven of NJ\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rYnlDCZTP1w?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>But I digress.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s get back to the song, because we&#8217;re about to get to the part where Bruce hints at glory still to come.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well, the interstate&#8217;s choked with nomadic hordes</em><br />\n<em>In Volkswagen vans with full running boards dragging great anchors</em><br />\n<em>Followin&#8217; dead-end signs into the sores</em><br />\n<em>The angel rides by humpin&#8217; his hunk metal whore</em></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s only a hop and a skip&#8211;not even a jump&#8211;from\u00a0<em>the interstate&#8217;s choked with nomadic hordes</em> to\u00a0<em>the highway&#8217;s jammed with broken heroes,\u00a0</em>and I&#8217;d argue that the imagery of the angel weaving effortlessly in and around the endless procession of VW vans (with a grace only elevated by the delicate, almost slow-motion melody) conveys a far more visceral freedom than &#8220;Born to Run&#8221; does.</p>\n<p>(&#8220;The Angel&#8221; isn&#8217;t the only 1972 song to evince the DNA of greatness to come. Check out &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/08/31/roll-of-the-dice-jesse/\">Jesse</a>&#8221; for early evidence of yet another.)</p>\n<p>The crude &#8220;hunk metal whore&#8221; metaphor is both apt (the angel is almost fetishistic toward his bike) and an ironic contrast to the intentionally nameless woman he&#8217;s about to pick up.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Madison Avenue&#8217;s claim to fame</em><br />\n<em>In a trainer bra with eyes like rain</em><br />\n<em>She rubs against the weather-beaten frame</em><br />\n<em>And asks the angel for his name</em><br />\n<em>Off in the distance the marble dome</em><br />\n<em>Reflects across the flatlands with a naked feel off into parts unknown</em><br />\n<em>The woman strokes his polished chrome</em><br />\n<em>And lies beside the angel&#8217;s bones</em></p>\n<p>Note that the woman asks the angel for his name; not only does he not provide it, he doesn&#8217;t ask for hers either. She&#8217;s not the love interest in the story. Even though this last verse is clearly and intentionally laced with double entendre (in another early instance of a someday classic line, Bruce somehow manages to make\u00a0<em>wrap your legs &#8217;round these velvet rims and strap your hands across my engines\u00a0</em>even more overtly sexual having Madison Avenue&#8217;s claim to fame rub against the angel&#8217;s frame and stroking his polished chrome), Bruce deliberately avoids pronouns that would indicate whether the sexual connotations refer to the biker or the bike.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The Angel&#8221; ends here, on an unsettled note. We expect more&#8211;if not a story, at least a set-up. But Bruce has said all he set out to say, painting a picture of a man fixated on living up to a self-image, obsessed with the instrument that will take him there, and peripheralizing if not ignoring those who would attempt to penetrate or distract from the illusion.</p>\n<p>Wherever could he have come up with the inspiration for that?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>We know Bruce played &#8220;The Angel&#8221; at least once, shortly after its release in early 1973. No recording survives (if there ever was one), so we don&#8217;t know how his audience received it. But we know that Bruce didn&#8217;t play it again for almost a quarter-century&#8211;and when he did revive it (by request from a fan who snuck his way into Bruce&#8217;s soundcheck in London), he sounded so self-consciously sheepish that if not for the shock value it would probably have been considered the evening&#8217;s lowlight.</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"VideoPress Video Player\" aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='426' src='https://videopress.com/embed/hWsdZ1Y5?hd=0&amp;cover=1' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script src='https://v0.wordpress.com/js/next/videopress-iframe.js?m=1739540970'></script></p>\n<p>Bruce wouldn&#8217;t attempt &#8220;The Angel&#8221; again for another thirteen years, and this time he didn&#8217;t have a choice: promising a complete, start-to-finish performance of his debut album for the first and only time ever, Bruce at least had a chance to consider how he wanted to approach it.</p>\n<p>He chose the original album arrangement, with guest artist Joyce Hammann on viola in place of Richard Davis&#8217;s double bass. Roy Bittan&#8217;s piano accompaniment is just as sensitive as Sancious&#8217; original version, but it&#8217;s Bruce&#8217;s vocals that were the breathtaking surprise. There&#8217;s no sheepishness in his reading below, only a nostalgic tenderness, as if singing about an old friend or a former self&#8211;either way, someone long gone but fondly remembered.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen &amp; ESB - The Angel &amp; Lost In The Flood (Live)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/830jgSJmBwM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>That night&#8211;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/11/22/where-the-band-was-buffalo-november-22-2009/\">November 22, 2009</a>&#8211;was the last time Bruce played &#8220;The Angel&#8221; in public to date. That entire tour-finale night felt like a chapter closing; a premonition that would prove true in ways we couldn&#8217;t and wouldn&#8217;t wanted to have imagine at the time.</p>\n<p>Bruce would continue to reach far back into his catalog (and even earlier) in the years to come, but that perfect performance of &#8220;The Angel&#8221; felt like a farewell and a fond send-off from a
