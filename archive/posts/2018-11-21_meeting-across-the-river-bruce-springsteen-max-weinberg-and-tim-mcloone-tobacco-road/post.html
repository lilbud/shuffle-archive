<p>In 1960, John D. Loudermilk wrote and recorded a semi-autobiographical blues song called “Tobacco Road.” It went nowhere.</p>

<p>Loudermilk’s song caught the attention of other musicians, though, and over the years it was covered by artists such as Jefferson Airplane, Eric Burdon &amp; The Animals, Lou Rawls, and David Lee Roth, to name a few.</p>
<p>But it was The Nashville Teens who broke through with it in 1964, reaching #14 in the US and #6 in the UK.</p>

<p>On January 20, 1991, Bruce took a swing at it, too, joining Max Weinberg, Tim McLoone, and other local musicians at a benefit show at McLoone’s Rum Runner in Sea Bright.</p>
<p>Bruce would cover it once more a few years later, but this 1991 performance is the only one that was recorded. Take a listen below.</p>
