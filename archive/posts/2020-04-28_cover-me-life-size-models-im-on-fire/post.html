<p>Meet Life Size Models.</p>
<p>An indie band with a sound both fresh and retro, Life Size Models is a band to watch. Their brand-new single, “Cusack, 1984” is fantastic–easily my favorite new song debut during this quarantine, and if you came of age in the 1980s like me, you’re going to love it.</p>
<p>But the B-side to “Cusack, 1984” is pretty stunning, too: a complete reinvention of Bruce’s “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/09/11/roll-of-the-dice-im-on-fire/">I’m on Fire</a>.”</p>
<p>Yeah, I know: <em>everyone</em> covers “I’m on Fire.”</p>
<p>There are zillions of versions out there, some better than others, but rarely do artists dare to stray very far from Bruce’s original arrangements. Life Size Models leaves the album arrangement way, way off in its rear view mirror, preserving the song’s simmering sexual desire while setting it against a hypnotic, U2-esque, 80s-alternative backing track.</p>
<p>Trust me on this–take a listen:</p>

<p>“I’m on Fire” may be a new single, but it’s been part of the band’s sets for a while. Here’s  a fantastic live performance from 2018. Turn up your volume first, though, because this one rocks even harder. (Skip to 43:15)</p>
