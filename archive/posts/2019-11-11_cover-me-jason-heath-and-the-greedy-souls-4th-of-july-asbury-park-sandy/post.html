<p>Dare I say it? This cover of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/04/26/roll-of-the-dice-4th-of-july-asbury-park-sandy/">4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)</a>” by Jason Heath and the Greedy Souls is absolutely perfect.</p>
<p>The band just nails every aspect, capturing not just the sound but the heart and soul of Bruce’s seaside original. I might even love it more than the original, in fact.</p>

<p>And if the accordion in particular sounds particularly evocative, there’s a reason: that’s Greedy Souls organist and accordion player Jason Federici you see and hear.</p>
<p>His dad would be proud.</p>
