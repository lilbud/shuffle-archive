I&#8217;m struck now as I was at first viewing by the images Bruce chose to show at key moments of the song: himself with Patti was an obvious choice. But a clip of Bruce and Stevie at the mic make it clear that Bruce didn&#8217;t write this song purely about romantic love. And the image of the anonymous old man during the instrumental bridge telegraphs the emergence of the song&#8217;s heart in verse three.</p>\n<p>But today I was struck by an image I&#8217;d overlooked before: around the 2:40 mark, at the key line:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Why do the things that connect us slowly pull us apart</em><br />\n<em>Till we fall away in our own darkness, stranger to our own hearts</em></p>\n<p>&#8230;there&#8217;s an image of an unknown older man, with an out-of-focus American flag waving in the background. I never noticed the flag before, but today I did&#8211;and I heard that line in a new and different way.</p>\n<p>And now I can hear the entire song through that lens as well. Did Bruce intend a double meaning? Is there a sly political subtext here? I think so: Bruce wrote and recorded a demo of &#8220;Life Itself&#8221; during the production of <em>Magic</em>\u00a0, and that line seems very much in keeping with what Bruce wrote and sang about on that album.</p>\n<p>And very much relevant today.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re still waiting to hear &#8220;Life Itself&#8221; performed live; Bruce has yet to premiere it. But if we ever get that long-rumored solo tour after his Broadway run is finished, I nominate it for a setlist staple&#8211;I suspect it&#8217;ll still be relevant by then.</p>\n<p><strong>Life Itself<br />\nRecorded:\u00a0</strong>2007-2008<br />\n<strong>Released:</strong> &#8220;Life Itself&#8221; (single) (2008);\u00a0<em>Working on a Dream</em> (2009)<br />\n<strong>Never Performed</strong></p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
