We have a rule here on the Shuffle: If you’re going to cover a Bruce Springsteen song, either do it different or do it better.

Every once in a while, though, it’s worth making an exception for someone who simply and powerfully *connects* with the song.

Lucas Mège is one such artist.

[Lucas’ YouTube page](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2MTdf9-lgbKVi7vShogaPg) features several great Springsteen covers, but his solo piano arrangement of “[Drive All Night](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/02/27/roll-of-the-dice-drive-all-night/)” is a cut above. Beautifully shot, impeccably recorded, and passionately performed, Lucas’ version is every bit as sincere, powerful, and gorgeous as Bruce’s original.

Take a few minutes out of your day to listen–you won’t be disappointed.
