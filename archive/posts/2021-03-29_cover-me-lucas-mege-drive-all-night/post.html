<p>We have a rule here on the Shuffle: If you’re going to cover a Bruce Springsteen song, either do it different or do it better.</p>
<p>Every once in a while, though, it’s worth making an exception for someone who simply and powerfully <em>connects</em> with the song.</p>
<p>Lucas Mège is one such artist.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2MTdf9-lgbKVi7vShogaPg">Lucas’ YouTube page</a> features several great Springsteen covers, but his solo piano arrangement of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/02/27/roll-of-the-dice-drive-all-night/">Drive All Night</a>” is a cut above. Beautifully shot, impeccably recorded, and passionately performed, Lucas’ version is every bit as sincere, powerful, and gorgeous as Bruce’s original.</p>
<p>Take a few minutes out of your day to listen–you won’t be disappointed.</p>
