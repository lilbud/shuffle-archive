The effect blew the minds of young and aspiring musicians, including Pete Townshend, Iggy Pop, Jimmy Page, and of course, Bruce Springsteen.</p>\n<p>Bruce got the chance to work with Wray, bringing him on stage on both the River and Tunnel of Love Tours, and of course Bruce and Link both played on <a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/01/31/cover-me-robert-gordon-and-link-wray-fire/\">Robert Gordon&#8217;s studio recording</a> of &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/08/05/roll-of-the-dice-fire/\">Fire</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But Bruce never took the opportunity to cover Wray&#8217;s signature song until after Wray passed away in 2005. A few weeks Wray&#8217;s passing, Bruce opened the final two shows of the Devils &amp; Dust Tour with an absolutely stunning cover of &#8220;Rumble&#8221; &#8212; bristling with power and growling with menace.</p>\n<p>Watch and listen below.
