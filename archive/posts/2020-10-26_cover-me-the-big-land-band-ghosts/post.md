It’s tempting to call The Big Land Band a Springsteen tribute band, but that would be too limiting. The Berlin-based rock band includes a healthy dose of Springsteen covers in its sets, but they also cover a range of rock and country artists in takes both faithful and fresh.

Today’s cover certainly falls in the “fresh” category in more ways than one.

“[Ghosts](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2023/07/06/roll-of-the-dice-ghosts/)” is one of Bruce’s newest tracks, and from the minute we first hear it performed with the E Street Band, it’s hard to imagine it performed acoustically.

And yet, here comes Big Land Band frontman William Goetz stepping up to the microphone to take a swing at it.

In contrast with Bruce’s celebratory original, Goetz’s cover of “Ghosts” is nostalgic and wistful, and it succeeds brilliantly.

I’m sure we’ll see many more *Letter to You* covers over the coming months, but this is a nice way to kick them off.
