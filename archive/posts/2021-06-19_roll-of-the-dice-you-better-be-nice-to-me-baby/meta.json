We&#8217;re taking another trip back to the Bruce Springsteen Band era, and this one&#8217;s a personal favorite.</p>\n<p>Presented here for your listening pleasure: a fifty-year-old never-recorded, extremely rare (performed only once that we know of) lost Springsteen original, &#8220;You Better Be Nice to Me, Baby.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t confuse this with the lost Bruce Springsteen Band original we listened to last week. That one was &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/06/13/roll-of-the-dice-ive-got-to-have-you-baby/\">I&#8217;ve Got to Have You, Baby</a>,&#8221; and it&#8217;s a completely different song (although Bruce played them back-to-back in a baby-centric set on September 1, 1971).</p>\n<p>If you thought &#8220;I&#8217;ve Got to Have You, Baby&#8221; was a fun listen, though, you&#8217;ve got a treat in store when you hear this one.</p>\n<p>Both songs delight, but if the former song is a bluesy jam, &#8220;You Better Be Nice to Me, Baby&#8221; is light on its feet, carried by a terrific David Sancious performance that would have been right at home in a late-night jazz club. In fact, with the possible exception of &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/01/22/roll-of-the-dice-kittys-back/\">Kitty&#8217;s Back</a>,&#8221; this is as close to jazz as you&#8217;ll ever hear Bruce get.</p>\n<div id=\"v-RB65kVa8-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='568' src='https://videopress.com/embed/RB65kVa8?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>As we can hear, both songs feature rare spotlight solos for Steve Van Zandt as well.</p>\n<p>Lyrically, we&#8217;re listening to Bruce at his braggadocious best. (I laugh out loud every time I hear him sing, &#8220;I can make Lawrence Welk go rock and roll!&#8221;)</p>\n<p>Like much of The Bruce Springsteen Band&#8217;s repertoire, &#8220;You Better Be Nice to Me, Baby&#8221; doesn&#8217;t require any lyrical analysis; this song is one hundred percent swagger. It&#8217;s also\u00a0so rare that there&#8217;s not even an entry for it (yet) on Springsteenlyrics.com, so here are what I&#8217;m 98% certain are Bruce&#8217;s lyrics:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Got a good woman, yeah she was looking pretty fine</em><br />\n<em>Yeah, we&#8217;re gonna sing the same song, mama, if we&#8217;re gonna get along</em><br />\n<em>There&#8217;s just one thing I gotta say&#8230;</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I can make rain fall from a cloudless sky</em><br />\n<em>I can make a bluebird forget how to fly</em><br />\n<em>I can call up a river to flood your home</em><br />\n<em>I can make a good girl go wrong</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>So you better be nice to me baby</em><br />\n<em>You better be nice to me baby</em><br />\n<em>You better be nice to me baby</em><br />\n<em>So I&#8217;ll be nice to you</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I can kill at a distance of forty feet</em><br />\n<em>I can steal the honey from a honeybee</em><br />\n<em>I can stop a train dead with a look in my eye</em><br />\n<em>I can make a grown man fall to his knees and cry</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>So you better be nice to me baby</em><br />\n<em>You better be nice to me baby</em><br />\n<em>You better be nice to me baby</em><br />\n<em>So I&#8217;ll be nice to you</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>[David Sancious solo]</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>[Steve Van Zandt solo]</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I can turn desert land into a paradise</em><br />\n<em>I can take a thorny girl and I can make her nice</em><br />\n<em>I can steal all the lightning from the sky above</em><br />\n<em>I can make anyone fall right in love</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I can swim the ocean in one week flat</em><br />\n<em>I can climb a mountain with a hand behind my back</em><br />\n<em>I can make a millionaire throw his money away</em><br />\n<em>I can hide that cargo to Bombay</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I&#8217;ll put you out on an eagle into outer space</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;m one man and I won the human race</em><br />\n<em>I can shake you with love right down to your soul</em><br />\n<em>I can make Lawrence Welk go rock and roll</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I can make a whole army turn around and run</em><br />\n<em>I can bend the barrel of my dad&#8217;s shotgun</em><br />\n<em>I can do most anything I set my mind to</em><br />\n<em>And honey, I&#8217;m setting my mind to you</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>So you better be nice to me baby</em><br />\n<em>You better be nice to me baby</em><br />\n<em>You better be nice to me baby</em><br />\n<em>So I&#8217;ll be nice to you</em></p>\n<p>(That&#8217;s probably the most fun I&#8217;ve ever had deciphering and transcribing lyrics from one of Bruce&#8217;s early songs.)</p>\n<p>If you enjoyed this little road trip in the wayback machine, you&#8217;ll be happy to know we&#8217;ve got at least one more return visit ahead of us later this summer. And if not, never fear&#8211;we&#8217;ll be back in Bruce&#8217;s officially released catalog in just a few days.</p>\n<p><strong>You Better Be Nice to Me, Baby<br />\nFirst performed:</strong> September 1, 1971 (Long Branch, NJ)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> September 1, 1971 (Long Branch, NJ)</p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
