<p>The last time was in 1992, when “Hail Hail Rock ‘n’ Roll” (the lead single off his <em>Don’t Call Me Buckwheat</em> album) cracked the Top 40 across Europe and even the Top 10 on the Dutch and Swiss charts.</p>

<p>But “Hail Hail Rock ‘n’ Roll” never registered at all in Garland’s native U.S., and that’s too bad–it’s a great song that celebrates the melting pot of rock music.</p>
<p>Garland resurfaced once more in the 21st century after Bruce Springsteen invited him to join his 2001 Asbury Park holiday concerts. That led to a creative rebirth for Jeffreys, although it never quite developed into a commercial one.</p>
<p>Still, that didn’t stop Garland from becoming a favorite on the Asbury Park music scene; he’d go on to make many appearances in the area and became a regular at the annual Light of Day festival.</p>
<p>On November 1, 2003, Garland Jeffreys played his own set at Light of Day after making a brief guest appearance the year before. Bruce had been in the house for a while, unobtrusively and respectfully watching Willie Nile and then Soozie Tyrell’s set.</p>
<p>But when Garland did his artist salutes during the song’s coda, he couldn’t help but out his friend, entreating Bruce to take to the stage… which of course, he did.</p>

<p>In the recording above, you can hear the moment when the crowd realizes that Bruce is actually on stage, and although his contributions are limited to a lead guitar lead-out, it’s one of the many great Light of Day moments Bruce has given us over the years.</p>
