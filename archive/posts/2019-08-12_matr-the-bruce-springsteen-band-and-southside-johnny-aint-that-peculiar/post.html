<p>Most entries in this blog’s <em>Meeting Across the River</em> series feature an already famous Bruce Springsteen teaming up with equally established artists. But today’s pairing goes way, way, waaaaay back… all the way to 1971, when a 22-year-old Bruce Springsteen was fronting a band named after himself.</p>
<p>Although you’d be hard pressed to tell the difference between The Bruce Springsteen Band and the E Street Band by its personnel (especially toward the end of its run, when it consisted only of Bruce, Steve Van Zandt, Garry Tallent, David Sancious, and Vini Lopez), you wouldn’t have any trouble figuring out which band you were listening to by their sound.</p>
<p>The Bruce Springsteen Band was a jam band to its core, and their sets featured a mix of brassy Springsteen originals and bluesy arrangements of popular rock and R&amp;B covers. On the night of November 13, 1971, they gave the Bruce Springsteen Band treatment to Marvin Gaye’s 1965 Top Ten hit, “Ain’t That Peculiar,” opening the show with it at The Student Prince in Asbury Park.</p>
<p>The band had a guest-star that night as well: Southside Johnny joined the band on harmonica throughout most of the set. And for that one-off “Ain’t That Peculiar” opener, Southside took lead vocals as well–although it’s David Sancious on keyboards who steals the show on this number.</p>
<p>Take a listen to this amazing recording (just in its mere existence all these years later) from that once-only performance of Southside Johnny fronting The Bruce Springsteen Band on Marvin Gaye’s “Ain’t That Peculiar.”</p>

<p>Gaye’s original recording is one of his best-known and -loved Motown classics, but obviously that didn’t stop Bruce from dramatically re-interpreting it. Compare the clip above with Gaye’s original recording below to fully appreciate just how inventive this young band was with their arrangements.</p>
