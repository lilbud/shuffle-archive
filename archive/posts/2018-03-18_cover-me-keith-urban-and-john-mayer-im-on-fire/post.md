There are enough covers of “[I’m on Fire](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/09/11/roll-of-the-dice-im-on-fire/)” to fuel a blog of its own, but this is one of my favorites–the guitar interplay is just exquisite, and you’d expect no less from John Mayer and Keith Urban.

From their 2010 concert at the Gorge Amphitheater in George, WA.
