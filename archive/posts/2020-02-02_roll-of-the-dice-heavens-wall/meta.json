In fact, maybe listen twice, because there&#8217;s a\u00a0<em>lot</em> going on in &#8220;Heaven&#8217;s Wall.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Heaven&#039;s Wall\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uRZbX9dJNU0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>See what I mean? In the first twenty seconds alone, we segue from a cowbell count-off to a samba intro to a gospel choir. The first verse hasn&#8217;t even kicked in yet, and I&#8217;m already dizzy.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>There was a woman waiting at the well</em><br />\n<em>Drawing water &#8216;neath the desert sky blue</em><br />\n<em>She said, &#8220;He&#8217;ll heal the blind, raise the dead, cure the sickness out of you&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>I&#8217;m a far cry from a biblical scholar&#8211;I&#8217;m not even sure I&#8217;ve read the greatest hits&#8211;so it&#8217;s possible I may be missing the significance of many of the references in &#8220;Heaven&#8217;s Wall.&#8221; But it seems pretty clear to me that the song is a celebration of the forgiveness that awaits those who truly repent their sins and embrace their faith.</p>\n<p>That said, I can&#8217;t help but feel that &#8220;Heaven&#8217;s Wall&#8221; is more of a songwriting experiment (&#8220;I wonder if I can write a gospel song&#8221;) than a story that had to be told. Or more accurately, it feels like an arranging experiment, because that Latin/gospel intro was just the beginning. Check out the eerie string effects that start with the next line and continue throughout the rest of the verses&#8211;it raises the hair on my arms every time I hear it.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Come on men of Gideon</em><br />\n<em>Come on men of Saul</em><br />\n<em>Come on sons of Abraham</em><br />\n<em>Waiting outside heaven&#8217;s wall</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Raise your hand, raise your hand, raise your hand</em><br />\n<em>Raise your hand, raise your hand, raise your hand</em><br />\n<em>And together we&#8217;ll walk into Canaan land</em><br />\n<em>Raise your hand, raise your hand, raise your hand</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>He saw the watcher at the city gates</em><br />\n<em>Jonah in the belly of the whale</em><br />\n<em>He watched you walk your ragged mile</em><br />\n<em>His mercy did not fail</em></p>\n<p>Most reviews that mentioned &#8220;Heaven&#8217;s Wall&#8221; focused on Tom Morello&#8217;s dueling guitar solos: he plays call-and-response solos that alternate between left and right channels&#8211;not only a cool technical effect but a clever way of underscoring the song&#8217;s gospel spirit.</p>\n<p>Morello&#8217;s solos may be the flashiest part of the arrangement, but to me the most impressive aspect of &#8220;Heaven&#8217;s Wall&#8221; is the fact that it works at all. If I didn&#8217;t know that Bruce has never done drugs in his life, I&#8217;d swear he must have been smoking\u00a0<em>something</em> when he came up with the idea to blend a samba rhythm, a middle eastern melody, a gospel choir, a self-guitar duel, and discordant strings into one giant melange.</p>\n<p>And it does indeed work. I can&#8217;t say that &#8220;Heaven&#8217;s Wall&#8221; is one of my favorite songs in Springsteen&#8217;s catalog, or even just on that one album, but I can&#8217;t help fixating on it every time I hear it.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s entrancing. I notice different things every time I hear it, and even if I don&#8217;t love it, I love knowing it exists.</p>\n<p>Keep on experimenting, Bruce!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Bruce played &#8220;Heaven&#8217;s Wall&#8221; live for the first time on the very day the <em>High Hopes</em> album dropped: January 14, 2014 on\u00a0<em>Late Night with Jimmy Fallon.\u00a0</em>Skip ahead to the 24:10 mark below and you can watch the live debut. (Nils plays the role of &#8220;Right Ear Tom&#8221; during the solos, because it would be weird to watch Tom duel himself.)</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"www.facebook.com/SpringsteenChile\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/84278263?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write\"></iframe></div>\n<p>Personally, I don&#8217;t think the songs ever translated perfectly from studio to stage&#8211;the E Street Band can&#8217;t quite capture live the alchemy of the studio track.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not for lack of trying, though&#8211;they gave it several great tries throughout the High Hopes Tour, and each was a lot of fun for both band and fans, starting with this rehearsal take in Cape Town.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - &quot;Heaven&#039;s Wall&quot; - Cape Town, Bellville Sound Check\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-GZ-Vbr01CI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Despite playing it for almost half of the entire High Hopes Tour, Bruce hasn&#8217;t touched &#8220;Heaven&#8217;s Wall&#8221; since, possibly because Morello&#8217;s absence would be noticeable during the solos, more likely because the deep cut wouldn&#8217;t have fit well on the River Tour (the only tour since <em>High Hopes</em>).</p>\n<p>But &#8220;Heaven&#8217;s Wall&#8221; is a fascinating song that explores dominant themes in Bruce&#8217;s modern music&#8211;it hopefully won&#8217;t remain dormant for long.</p>\n<p><strong>Heaven&#8217;s Wall<br />\nRecorded:</strong> 2007-2013<br />\n<strong>Released:\u00a0</strong><em>High Hopes\u00a0</em>(2014)<br />\n<strong>First performed:</strong> January 14, 2014 (New York City, NY)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> April 26, 2014 (Atlanta, GA)</p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
