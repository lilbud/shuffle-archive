**1972:** Bruce continues his solo stand (the second of six nights) opening for Dave Van Ronk at Max’s Kansas City in New York. At one of these shows, Bruce opens with “[Henry Boy](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/04/08/roll-of-the-dice-henry-boy/)” and closes with “[Growin’ Up](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/09/29/roll-of-the-dice-growin-up/),” and both are captured on video by Barry Rebo.

**1974:** Bruce cancels a scheduled gig in Port Chester, New York to make room for ongoing *Born to Run* recording sessions.

**1975:** There’s a *before* and an *after* with Bruce’s career, and both pivot around Bruce’s legendary residency at New York’s Bottom Line. This is the last *before* show at the Allen Theater in Cleveland. Bruce closes the show with a solo piano tour premiere of “[For You](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/01/08/roll-of-the-dice-for-you/)” — a quiet end to this phase of Bruce’s career.
