Bruce doesn’t make it up to the Pacific Northwest that often, so when he does, I try to catch the entire Portland-Seattle-Vancouver swing (almost always in that order).

Portland usually gets the Night One honors, which typically means a short, predictable show–and this night on the Magic tour was no exception.

The show was definitely on the short side (hard to believe that the shows grew from 2:20 mid-way through the Magic tour to 4:00+ by the end of 2016), and the crowd was, too (the arena wasn’t even close to sold out)–but Bruce made up for the short duration with high-voltage intensity, kicking things off with “” as the opener.

Almost.



My most vivid memory from that show is the big group of lesbians in the pit with us, rocking out and having a blast. How do I know they were lesbians? Because they were all wearing t-shirts emblazoned “Lesbians (heart) Bruce!” Every time he noticed them, Bruce cracked up, and by the encore, he was playing directly to them, giving a shout-out in “” to “…the lesbians and the Jews!” If the main set was intense, the encore was a big party.[American Land](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/01/10/roll-of-the-dice-american-land/)

In short, a fun show, and serviceable if predictable opener for a three-night PacNW stand. Nights Two and Three would bring their share of surprises and then some.
