(Its first three tracks&#8211;&#8220;Coming Back,&#8221; &#8220;All I Needed Was You,&#8221; and &#8220;It&#8217;s Been a Long Time&#8221; certainly send a pointed message, though.)</p>\n<p>&#8220;All I Needed Was You&#8221; sounds like classic Southside Johnny, which is to say it sounds like classic Steve Van Zandt, who wrote most of the tracks on\u00a0<em>Better Days </em>(&#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/06/11/cover-me-southside-johnny-all-the-way-home/\">All the Way Home</a>&#8221; was a notable exception) as well as many of Southside&#8217;s greatest songs throughout his career.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"All I Needed Was You\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ueh1z_w4umk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>But despite the close bond between Southside, Steve, and Bruce (who wrote his fair share of Southside hits as well), the three lifelong amigos have only performed &#8220;All I Needed Was You&#8221; twice&#8211;on back-to-back nights&#8211;during Bruce&#8217;s original Asbury Park holiday benefit shows in December 2000.</p>\n<p>The song choice came as a surprise (one of many during those nights), capping off a Southside/Little Steven mini-set in the middle of each show. All three songs were penned by Steve, starting with an old favorite, &#8220;This Time It&#8217;s For Real.&#8221; &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/11/17/meeting-across-the-river-little-steven-and-bruce-springsteen-until-the-good-is-gone/\">Until the Good is Gone</a>&#8221; (only performed by Bruce once before) followed.</p>\n<p>But it was the third selection that raised eyebrows at that first holiday show: &#8220;All I Needed Was You&#8221; was much more than a first-time Springsteen performance&#8211;it was a true team-up, with all three vocalists taking a turn at the lead.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Southside Johnny, Bruce
