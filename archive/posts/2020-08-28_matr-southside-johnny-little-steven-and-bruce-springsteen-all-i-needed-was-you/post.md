Little Steven may have written it, but on the evening of December 17, 2000, it belonged to three longtime friends.

"All I Needed Was You" was the second track on Southside Johnny's 1991 don't-call-it-a-comeback album, *Better Days*. (Its first three tracks–"Coming Back," "All I Needed Was You," and "It's Been a Long Time" certainly send a pointed message, though.)

"All I Needed Was You" sounds like classic Southside Johnny, which is to say it sounds like classic Steve Van Zandt, who wrote most of the tracks on *Better Days* ("[All the Way Home](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/06/11/cover-me-southside-johnny-all-the-way-home/)" was a notable exception) as well as many of Southside's greatest songs throughout his career.

But despite the close bond between Southside, Steve, and Bruce (who wrote his fair share of Southside hits as well), the three lifelong amigos have only performed "All I Needed Was You" twice–on back-to-back nights–during Bruce's original Asbury Park holiday benefit shows in December 2000.

The song choice came as a surprise (one of many during those nights), capping off a Southside/Little Steven mini-set in the middle of each show. All three songs were penned by Steve, starting with an old favorite, "This Time It's For Real." "[Until the Good is Gone](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/11/17/meeting-across-the-river-little-steven-and-bruce-springsteen-until-the-good-is-gone/)" (only performed by Bruce once before) followed.

But it was the third selection that raised eyebrows at that first holiday show: "All I Needed Was You" was much more than a first-time Springsteen performance–it was a true team-up, with all three vocalists taking a turn at the lead.

And if the final minute-and-a-half–with Southside, Steve, and Bruce weaving a coda effortlessly as only musicians with a lifetime of performing together can do–doesn't bring joy to your ears, I don't know what will.
