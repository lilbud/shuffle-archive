Often Bruce would stay for two songs, but the one constant each night was a Stipe/Springsteen duet on R.E.M.&#8217;s 1992 hit, &#8220;Man on the Moon.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"R.E.M. - Man On The Moon (Official HD Music Video)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dLxpNiF0YKs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;Man on the Moon&#8221; was a Top 40 hit for R.E.M.
