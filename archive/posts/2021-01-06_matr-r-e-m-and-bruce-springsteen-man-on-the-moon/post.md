It had been a long time since Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band had a regular opening act, let alone one that could have been a headliner on its own, but as Election Day 2004 approached, artists across America joined forces in an all-out, last-mile push to mobilize voters in support of the Democratic presidential ticket.

The Vote for Change Tour was actually a collection of mini-tours under a common banner, each featuring a collection of stellar acts teaming up for a night of galvanizing music designed to draw big audiences.

Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band headlined one branch of the tour, with Bright Eyes and R.E.M. opening and John Fogerty contributing a mini-set of his own with Bruce and the E Street Band.

The assembled artists played six shows during the first eleven days of October, and with so many opportunities to collaborate, fans knew they were bound to see some terrific team-ups.

And they did: each night, Bruce joined R.E.M. for part of their set (and they joined for part of his). Often Bruce would stay for two songs, but the one constant each night was a Stipe/Springsteen duet on R.E.M.’s 1992 hit, “Man on the Moon.”

“Man on the Moon” was a Top 40 hit for R.E.M. (peaking at #30 on the Hot 100), the second single from a remarkable string of six from *Automatic for the People*.

It may not have been a topical selection, but it was a perfect song choice for Bruce–right in the lower end of his register, with an opportunity for a scorching guitar solo and an Elvis impersonation. Who could ask for more?

The Vote for Change Tour was ultimately a failed endeavor in that it would take another four years before America saw true political change. But it marked an inflection point for Bruce’s political activism–he’s taken to the stage in support of Democratic presidential candidates ever since.
