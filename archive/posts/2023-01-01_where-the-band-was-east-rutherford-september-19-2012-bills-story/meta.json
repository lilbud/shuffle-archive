I highly recommend checking out <a href=\"http://billk128.tumblr.com/\">Bill&#8217;s blog</a>&#8211;he&#8217;s got some great show reviews (not just Bruce-related) and insightful commentary.</i></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><i>If you&#8217;d like to connect with Bill directly, you can reach him on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/billk128\">@billk128</a>.\u00a0</i></span></p>\n</div></div>\n<p>If it wasn\u2019t the same old Meadowlands Parking Lot this time, it might as well have been&#8211;just slightly re-located and renamed along with the stadium, now MetLife Stadium. All the same glorious tailgate vibe was in full force for Night One of three that Bruce and the band would be playing to wrap up the summer and their outdoor venue leg of the Wrecking Ball Tour.</p>\n<p>Lo and behold, Gene DeRose was in attendance, a face unseen for some time in my world, and some other old faces from the Irvington, New York mafia appeared as well, along with Weedy, my cohort on the very first show (for us) of this epic tour that we saw back in April. Gene was kind enough to bring a few large bottles of a microbrew from (I believe) a St. Lawrence (upstate NY) brewery, and these bottles were called \u201cgrowlers,\u201d a term I had never heard before. Those growlers certainly provided a nice edge for the proceedings that followed.</p>\n<p>Weedy was bit tardy arriving, and I left my sister and other friends (including Bud\u2019s \u201cindustry\u201d soiree, itself a banner tailgate in its own right) to wander the lot w/ Gene and his bro-in-law Joe in search of the Irvington crew, playing a new kind of over/under game: as we passed groups of people, they were tagged as either under or over 30. DeRose remained the age skeptic, not believing that these crowds have trended younger on this tour. New Jersey may not be the best place to see this trend, but even the home turf showed the signs.</p>\n<p>We ventured in and made no real effort to get up close, which left us plenty of room to groove to yet another high-energy offering from the seemingly indefatigable Bossman and mates. While the setlist echoed to some degree the one played a few nights earlier in DC, there were some interesting twists, largely due to the appearance of Patti, who had not played a show in months. To wit:</p>\n<p>&#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/07/16/roll-of-the-dice-shackled-and-drawn/\">Shackled and Drawn</a>\u201d opened the show.
