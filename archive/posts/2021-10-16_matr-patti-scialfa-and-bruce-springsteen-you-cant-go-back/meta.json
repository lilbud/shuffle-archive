Her glasses aren&#8217;t rose-colored (there&#8217;s a reason she slyly co-ops the chord progression from Lou Reed&#8217;s &#8220;Walk on the Wild Side&#8221;), but it&#8217;s significant that she anchors her memory in 1988, leaving no doubt who she&#8217;s singing to in the first verse.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You Can&#8217;t Go Back,&#8221; she sings, but you can carry your past with you&#8211;something she suggests with a carefully crafted backing track containing a musical m\u00e9lange of styles past and present. Patti&#8217;s husband is fittingly part of that track, contributing his electric guitar and keyboards underneath Patti&#8217;s vocals.</p>\n<p>And while Bruce and Patti have never performed it together in concert, we fortunately have documents of Patti performing it herself. Well, not exactly by herself, but with her own backing band&#8211;one that features a few familiar faces.</p>\n<div id=\"v-VKJ2hyKD-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='426' src='https://videopress.com/embed/VKJ2hyKD?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p><strong>You Can&#8217;t Go Back<br />\nRecorded:</strong> January 200<br />\n<strong>Released:\u00a0</strong><em>23rd Street Lullaby</em> (2004)<br />\n<strong>Never performed</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>It may be called 23rd Street Lullaby, but &#8220;You Can&#8217;t Go Back&#8221; is the song that best captures the spirit of Patti&#8217;s second album.</p>\n", "protected": false}, "author": 1, "featured_media": 30327, "comment_status": "open", "ping_status": "open", "sticky": false, "template": "", "format": "standard", "meta": {"_monsterinsights_skip_tracking": false, "_monsterinsights_sitenote_active": false, "_monsterinsights_sitenote_note": "", "_monsterinsights_sitenote_category": 0, "jetpack_post_was_ever_published": false, "_jetpack_newsletter_access": "", "_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs": false, "_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id": 0, "_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content": false, "_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content": false, "footnotes": "", "jetpack_publicize_message": "", "jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled": true, "jetpack_social_post_already_shared": true, "jetpack_social_options": {"image_generator_settings": {"template": "highway", "default_image_id": 0, "font": "", "enabled": false}, "version": 2}}, "categories": [5], "tags": [573, 115, 3315], "class_list": ["post-30171", "post", "type-post", "status-publish", "format-standard", "has-post-thumbnail", "hentry", "category-meeting-across-the-river", "tag-23rd-street-lullaby", "tag-patti-scialfa", "tag-you-cant-go-back"], "aioseo_notices": [], "jetpack_publicize_connections": [], "jetpack_featured_media_url": "https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/youcant.jpg?fit=1280%2C720&ssl=1", "jetpack_sharing_enabled": true, "jetpack_shortlink": "https://wp.me/p9w3Lk-7QD", "jetpack_likes_enabled": true, "jetpack-related-posts": [{"id": 1225, "url": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/03/21/meeting-across-the-river-patti-scialfa-and-bruce-springsteen-rose/", "url_meta": {"origin": 30171, "position": 0}, "title": "Meeting Across the River: Patti Scialfa and Bruce Springsteen, &#8220;Rose&#8221;", "author": "Ken", "date": "March 21, 2018", "format": false, "excerpt": "Spotlight on Patti today, as Bruce backs her on one of her earliest songs.
