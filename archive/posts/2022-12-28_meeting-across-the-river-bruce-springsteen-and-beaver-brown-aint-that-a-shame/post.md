The quality ain’t great on this one, but it’s a chance to hear Bruce and Beaver Brown cover this rarely-performed Fats Domino 1955 classic at the raucous Big Man’s West in Red Bank, New Jersey, back in 1982. Bruce has covered this song five times over the years, but only in small club or bar appearances.

Bonus: here’s a fantastic clip of Fats himself performing it in the 1956 movie,
