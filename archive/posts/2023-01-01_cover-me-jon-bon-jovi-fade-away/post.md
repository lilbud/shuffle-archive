I don’t know much about the source of today’s video; perhaps some Bon Jovi fans can help me out.

The original Youtube poster cites this as hailing from Jon Bon Jovi’s sole stop in Japan on his 1997 tour, and I have no reason doubt that.

*Destination Anywhere*

If so, however, someone needs to correct the setlist record, because there’s no mention of Jon’s beautiful cover of Bruce’s “” below.

Interestingly, though, the setlist archive indicates that John opened the show with “” (an entirely different Buddy Holly song) and encored with Bruce’s “.” Perhaps one of those is a mistaken reference to “Fade Away” instead.

Regardless of where it was, though, Jon gave a lovely and faithful performance of the song that night, and it’s a worthy addition to the vast catalog of Springsteen covers.
