<p>…and there’s Aretha Franklin’s legendary, number-one-on-the-Hot 100, Grammy-winning 1967 anthem that <em>Rolling Stone </em>ranks as the fifth greatest song of all time.</p>

<p>Back in the early days of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the post-induction all-star jam sessions were a lot more impromptu, and boy does it show in this video clip from the fourth annual induction ceremony at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City on January 18, 1989.</p>
<p>I can’t even tell which version they’re performing–it sounds like a mash-up of Aretha’s verses and Otis’ chorus. But hey, it’s Stevie Wonder, Mick Jagger, Little Richard, Bruce Springsteen, and other legends sharing a stage and cutting loose, and it brings a smile to my face every time I watch it.</p>
<p>Oh, and of course: Tina Turner, one of this year’s newly announced Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees finally getting some long-deserved R-E-S-P-E-C-T.</p>
