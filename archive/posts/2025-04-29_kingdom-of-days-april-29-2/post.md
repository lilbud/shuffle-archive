**1976:** Eddie Floyd guest-stars on “[Raise Your Hand](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/05/21/cover-me-raise-your-hand/),” and “[Knock on Wood](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/04/02/cover-me-knock-on-wood/)” (Floyd’s greatest hit) at Bruce’s show in Memphis. Following the show, Bruce and Steve taxi out to Graceland and jump the gate, hoping to meet Elvis but instead are kicked off the property by security. Watch Bruce tell the story decades later (he gets the year wrong, though).
