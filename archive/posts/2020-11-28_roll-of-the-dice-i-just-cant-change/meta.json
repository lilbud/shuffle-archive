Bruce wrote it in 1971, and he performed it live with the Bruce Springsteen Band through 1972, although only one specific performance is documented and recorded.</p>\n<p>Although the song itself wouldn&#8217;t survive 1972, its melody was resurrected in 1975.

Or maybe he just decided he could put its melody to better use, because it re-appeared in 1975 grafted to the lyrics of &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/06/06/roll-of-the-dice-the-e-street-shuffle/\">The E Street Shuffle</a>,&#8221; for a gorgeous arrangement that Bruce played frequently on the Born to Run tour (and which <a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/01/28/cover-me-bette-midler-the-e-street-shuffle/\">Bette Midler covered </a>on vinyl and film).</p>\n<p>In any event, enjoy this curious historical artifact, because this is one song we&#8217;re unlikely to hear played live again.</p>\n<p><strong>I Just Can&#8217;t Change</strong><strong><br />\nRecorded:</strong> N/A<br />\n<strong>Released:</strong> N/A<br />\n<strong>Performed:</strong> February 4, 1972 (Richmond, VA)</p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
