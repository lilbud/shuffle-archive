It’s a rule that Night Two of a two-night stand is always better than [Night One](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/04/28/where-the-band-was-philadelphia-april-28-2009/). Bruce tends to play it safe on the opening night and let loose on the last night.

But in Philly, *all* nights are special, and at these first two of six shows on the Working on a Dream Tour (the other four were six months away), it’s a toss-up as to which was the stronger of the two.

I’ll set “[The Fever](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/10/04/roll-of-the-dice-the-fever/)” aside, because nothing would top the exhilaration I felt hearing that for the first time. The only thing that would come close is hearing “[Kitty’s Back,](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/01/22/roll-of-the-dice-kittys-back/)” which moved to the number one spot on my wishlist when I retired “The Fever” 24 hours prior.

What did Bruce deal Philly in the wild card pack on this night? First up, the E Street Band premiere of The Clash’s “[London Calling,](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/04/09/matr-bruce-springsteen-elvis-costello-steve-van-zandt-dave-grohl-london-calling/)” played by Bruce only once prior, at the Grammy Awards six years earlier; next, a rollicking arrangement of “[Red Headed Woman](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/09/15/roll-of-the-dice-red-headed-woman/)” to welcome Patti back to the stage (she’d missed a few shows due to an injury), and finally the best performance of “[Thundercrack](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/09/24/roll-of-the-dice-thundercrack/)” I’ve had the privilege to see (somehow, I’ve managed to catch this rarity five times).

Next up: “[Waitin’ on a Sunny Day](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/09/27/roll-of-the-dice-waitin-on-a-sunny-day/)” gets a night off, with “[Hungry Heart](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/12/21/roll-of-the-dice-hungry-heart/)” a welcome substitute. Bruce’s mom even contributed some guest vocals:

“[The Wrestler](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/10/31/roll-of-the-dice-the-wrestler/)” also took a break–Bruce swapped it for “[Streets of Philadelphia](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/06/30/roll-of-the-dice-streets-of-philadelphia/)” instead–another song on my wish list.

Then came the encores, and once again, Bruce pitched Philly a bonus: “Thunder Road,” dedicated to the late Harry Kalas, whose customer voiceover for Bruce sent the crowd roaring.

…but Bruce *still* wasn’t done. After “[American Land](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/01/10/roll-of-the-dice-american-land/),” I waited to see which final number Bruce would send us home with. It had been “Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)” the night before, so it was almost certain to be “[Glory Days](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2024/06/04/roll-of-the-dice-glory-days/)” tonight. (He’d been alternating between them for most of the tour.) Or maybe it would be “[Dancing in the Dark](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/12/25/roll-of-the-dice-dancing-in-the-dark/)“–that chestnut had made a few appearances in that slot, too.

But it wasn’t any of them. On this night, Bruce pulled out a tour debut–and unbelievably, I got my #1 most-chased song only 24 hours after getting my previous one: Bruce sent us off into the night dancing to the strains of an epic 13-minute “Kitty’s Back.” It didn’t seem like Bruce ever wanted to stop–there was even a reprise–and those last three minutes were among the most joyous I’ve ever experienced at a Springsteen show.
