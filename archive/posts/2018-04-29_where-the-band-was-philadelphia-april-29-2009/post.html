<p>It’s a rule that Night Two of a two-night stand is always better than <a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/04/28/where-the-band-was-philadelphia-april-28-2009/">Night One</a>. Bruce tends to play it safe on the opening night and let loose on the last night.</p>
<p>But in Philly, <em>all</em> nights are special, and at these first two of six shows on the Working on a Dream Tour (the other four were six months away), it’s a toss-up as to which was the stronger of the two.</p>
<p>I’ll set “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/10/04/roll-of-the-dice-the-fever/">The Fever</a>” aside, because nothing would top the exhilaration I felt hearing that for the first time. The only thing that would come close is hearing “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/01/22/roll-of-the-dice-kittys-back/">Kitty’s Back,</a>” which moved to the number one spot on my wishlist when I retired “The Fever” 24 hours prior.</p>
<p>What did Bruce deal Philly in the wild card pack on this night? First up, the E Street Band premiere of The Clash’s “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/04/09/matr-bruce-springsteen-elvis-costello-steve-van-zandt-dave-grohl-london-calling/">London Calling,</a>” played by Bruce only once prior, at the Grammy Awards six years earlier; next, a rollicking arrangement of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/09/15/roll-of-the-dice-red-headed-woman/">Red Headed Woman</a>” to welcome Patti back to the stage (she’d missed a few shows due to an injury), and finally the best performance of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/09/24/roll-of-the-dice-thundercrack/">Thundercrack</a>” I’ve had the privilege to see (somehow, I’ve managed to catch this rarity five times).</p>

<p>Next up: “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/09/27/roll-of-the-dice-waitin-on-a-sunny-day/">Waitin’ on a Sunny Day</a>” gets a night off, with “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/12/21/roll-of-the-dice-hungry-heart/">Hungry Heart</a>” a welcome substitute. Bruce’s mom even contributed some guest vocals:</p>

<p>“<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/10/31/roll-of-the-dice-the-wrestler/">The Wrestler</a>” also took a break–Bruce swapped it for “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/06/30/roll-of-the-dice-streets-of-philadelphia/">Streets of Philadelphia</a>” instead–another song on my wish list.</p>

<p>Then came the encores, and once again, Bruce pitched Philly a bonus: “Thunder Road,” dedicated to the late Harry Kalas, whose customer voiceover for Bruce sent the crowd roaring.</p>

<p>…but Bruce <em>still</em> wasn’t done. After “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/01/10/roll-of-the-dice-american-land/">American Land</a>,” I waited to see which final number Bruce would send us home with. It had been “Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)” the night before, so it was almost certain to be “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2024/06/04/roll-of-the-dice-glory-days/">Glory Days</a>” tonight. (He’d been alternating between them for most of the tour.) Or maybe it would be “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/12/25/roll-of-the-dice-dancing-in-the-dark/">Dancing in the Dark</a>“–that chestnut had made a few appearances in that slot, too.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t any of them. On this night, Bruce pulled out a tour debut–and unbelievably, I got my #1 most-chased song only 24 hours after getting my previous one: Bruce sent us off into the night dancing to the strains of an epic 13-minute “Kitty’s Back.” It didn’t seem like Bruce ever wanted to stop–there was even a reprise–and those last three minutes were among the most joyous I’ve ever experienced at a Springsteen show.</p>
