**1986:** The town of Freehold cancels the permit for a planned Jersey Artists for Mankind outdoor benefit show when a rumor spread that Bruce would appear. The small park can't hold the expected throngs, so the town cancels the event.

**1991:** *Newsday* reports that Bruce and Patti will marry on June 9th, according to a mysterious source "close to the bride-to-be." After Bruce's publicist coyly refuses to confirm or deny ("I can't confirm that date..."), the worldwide press runs rampant with the story and anticipation builds for the big day. It's highly likely that Bruce and Patti planted the story (or authorized the leak) themselves in order to throw the press off the scent, as their actual wedding ceremony will take place a day earlier, on June 8th–a lesson learned from Bruce's experience the last time around.
