<p>The Gresham Flyers were a London-based power pop septet that were generating some indie pop buzz there for a while back in the mid-2000s.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the band broke up in 2011, but they were on the scene long enough to contribute one of the strongest tracks on the outstanding Springsteen tribute album, <em>Play Some Pool, Skip Some School, Act Real Cool</em>.  (Check out other great featured tracks from the album <a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/?s=play+pool+skip+school">here</a>.)</p>
<p>Now, if you’re a Springsteen fan (and of course you are, or you wouldn’t be reading this), you might be thinking that “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/09/13/roll-of-the-dice-magic/">Magic</a>” and power pop don’t exactly go together.</p>
<p>To that, I answer only: listen to this.</p>

<p>The Flyers do a bang-up job of transforming Bruce’s moody caution into a sinister rocker without losing an ounce of the original’s impact–which is good, because this is a song that deserves attention today more than ever.</p>
