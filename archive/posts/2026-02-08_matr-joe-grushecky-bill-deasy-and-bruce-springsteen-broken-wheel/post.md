meta-description: You won’t hear Bruce’s voice on Joe Grushecky’s “Broken Wheel,” but you’ll certainly hear his guitar lending power to an already killer song.

Joe Grushecky’s very fine album is known by Springsteen fans primarily because it’s the home of the studio version of “Another Thin Line,” co-written and performed by both Bruce and Joe.

*East Carson Street*

But while “Another Thin Line” may be the only song on Joe’s 2009 album that features Bruce’s vocals, it’s not the only song to which Bruce contributed his talents.

Deep in the middle of the album, we find “Broken Wheel.”

Written and performed by Joe and fellow Pittsburgh singer/songwriter Bill Deasy, “Broken Wheel” is a song about a broken heart (for reasons I shall not spoil, but suffice to say this is not a love song), and it features Bruce prominently on lead guitar.

It’s a beautiful, powerful, and haunting song, with or without Bruce’s accompaniment, on an album that should be in every Springsteen fan’s collection.
