Actually, it’s a couple of towns. Omemee, Ontario, is one of them. It’s where I first went to school and spent my ‘formative’ years. Actually I was born in Toronto… *I was born in Toronto*… God, that sounds like the first line of a Bruce Springsteen song.” — Neil Young, <em>Mojo, </em>December 1995</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe if Neil Young had set his beloved “Helpless” (first recorded and released by Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young on their 1970 <em>Deja Vu</em> album) in Toronto, Bruce would have covered it sooner?</p>

<p>As it stands, it took Bruce until 1986 to visit Neil’s town in North Ontario, but it was a special moment when he did.</p>
<p>It was at Neil and Pegi Young’s first Bridge School benefit show in 1986, and Bruce was in the house to play an acoustic set that night. (Bruce put on a terrific show that’s available for purchase as part of Bruce’s official archive series–get it <a href="https://live.brucespringsteen.net/live-music/0,22746/Bruce-Springsteen-mp3-flac-download-10-13-1986-Bridge-School-Benefit-Concert-at-Shoreline-Amphitheatre-Mountain-View-CA.html">here</a>.)</p>
<p>But Neil went first, and in the middle of his set he invited Bruce to the stage, along with Nils Lofgren, a member of both icons’ bands.  Side by side for the first time, the three musical legends performed a beautiful acoustic rendition of “Helpless.”</p>
