Fox, and Spinal Tap&#8217;s Michael McKean.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Joan Jett &amp; Michael J.

He debuted it shortly after the movie was released, at The Stone Pony with The E Street Band and Cats on a Smooth Surface. Here&#8217;s that first performance, from April 12, 1987:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - &quot;Light of Day&quot; - Asbury Park, 1987-04-12\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/InoUhZB78PE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Bruce played it a few times at the bar that summer, and then the following year, it took the place of &#8220;Rosalita (Come Out Tonight) &#8221; as Bruce&#8217;s steady main set-closer. It held that position from 1988 all the way through the Reunion Tour (taking time off during Bruce&#8217;s solo acoustic tour).</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s be honest, though: the song&#8217;s surprising staying power is more due to it&#8217;s hard-rocking guitar riffs and pounding percussion more than for incisive lyrics.</p>\n<p>The story itself (such as it is) is simply the desperate drive of a newly unemployed young man eager to get laid, racing to Galveston, Texas, where his brother works and assures him that the girls are pretty hot.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Well I&#8217;ve been out of the woods for six days and nights now</em><br />\n<em>Well I&#8217;m a little hot wired, but I&#8217;m feeling alright</em><br />\n<em>I got some money in my pocket and a long lean ride</em><br />\n<em>I got to make it down to Galveston by Saturday night, now</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Been driving five hundred miles, got five hundred to go, yeah</em><br />\n<em>I got rock and roll music on the radio</em><br />\n<em>I got a brother on a rig just off the gulf coast</em><br />\n<em>He says the girls down there, well they&#8217;re really the most, man</em></p>\n<p>Our hero has had a bad run of luck lately, but he&#8217;s optimistic about the future&#8211;or about Saturday night, at least. He&#8217;s not even 100% sure whether his brother was serious about the girls, but he doesn&#8217;t care&#8211;at this point, it&#8217;s the only thing he has to look forward to:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Well I got thrown out of work on the Kokomo</em><br />\n<em>Don&#8217;t ask me what I&#8217;m doing, I don&#8217;t know</em><br />\n<em>I hope he wasn&#8217;t joking when he wrote me that letter</em><br />\n<em>Things can&#8217;t get any worse, they got to get better</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Well I&#8217;m a little down under, but I&#8217;m feeling O.K.</em><br />\n<em>I got a little lost along the way</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;m just around the corner to the light of day</em></p>\n<p>(Note: there several Kokomos in the U.S., but I did the math, and the only one that appears to be 1,000 miles away (or even close to it) is in Indiana. You&#8217;re welcome.)</p>\n<p>And as time, passed the song grew in length and power. Almost immediately, Bruce discovered that in addition to serving as a great showcase for band introductions, the structure of &#8220;Light of Day&#8221; also lent itself to mashups and vamping.</p>\n<p>In 1992, Bruce gave his new touring band a chance to stretch themselves and show off, and the song began to take on a life of its own. Their barnburner of a performance on MTV convinced Bruce to include it on his awkwardly titled <em>In Concert/MTV Plugged</em> album (the first and only official release of the song), and the world was re-introduced to a song most people didn&#8217;t even know he wrote. Not only that, &#8220;Light of Day&#8221; also served as the introduction to a verbal vamp that would continue to grow in length, passion, sincerity and silliness until it exploded into a mission statement on the Reunion Tour.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen &amp; The E Street Band - Light of Day (Live in New York City)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0QWhPWBJPik?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>It remains a mystery to me how that performance of &#8220;Light of Day&#8221; could have been omitted from the official\u00a0<em>Live in New York City</em> album, but it is indeed one of the ironies of the song: the set-closer for two E Street Band tours (three if you include the majority of the American High Hopes Tour) has never had a studio or an E Street Band release.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s especially surprising considering the band actually did record the song in the studio, on May 25, 1983, during the\u00a0<em>Born in the U.S.A. </em>sessions. What happened next is tangled, so follow along:</p>\n<p>Film auteur Paul Schrader wrote a movie screenplay in 1981 called\u00a0<em>Born in the U.S.A.\u00a0</em>and asked Bruce to write a song for it. Bruce declined, but something about the title of the screenplay obviously stuck with him&#8211;and inspired him to transform his work-in-progress song &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/08/31/roll-of-the-dice-vietnam/\">Vietnam</a>&#8221; into what we came to know as the title track for his most successful album.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Schrader hadn&#8217;t actually got around to making his movie. When he was ready to do so in 1985, his original title of &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/09/21/roll-of-the-dice-born-in-the-u-s-a/\">Born in the U.S.A.</a>&#8221; was no longer available due to the mega-blockbuster status of the song he inspired. Bruce must have felt a little guilty about that, so he offered Schrader an outtake that didn&#8217;t make the album: &#8220;Just Around the Corner to the Light of Day.&#8221; Schrader dug it, accepted it, and changed and shortened the title of the movie to match the song (Bruce shortened the song title as well), bringing us full circle.</p>\n<p>So that&#8217;s the story of &#8220;Light of Day,&#8221; the never-released outtake that&#8217;s rocked the house for three decades.</p>\n<p>May it always be just around the corner.</p>\n<p><strong>Update 11/17/19:\u00a0</strong>I recently saw Bruce play &#8220;Light of Day&#8221; almost literally just around the corner from where he grew up. On September 28, 2019, Bruce made a surprise appearance at the preview party for an exhibit at the Monmouth County Historical Museum devoted to his early life. Here&#8217;s that performance (with Joe Grushecky and the Houserockers), along with hope for many more.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen/Joe Grushecky - &quot;Light of Day&quot; - Freehold, NJ - 9/28/19\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PCJhy7XowvY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><strong>Update 10/29/21: </strong>If Joe&#8217;s band seemed particularly well-suited for the challenge in the clip above, that&#8217;s because they have plenty of practice with &#8220;Light of Day.&#8221; It appears frequently when Bruce and Joe perform together, going all the way back to their 1995 &#8220;October Assault&#8221; tour in support of\u00a0<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/10/17/american-babylon-a-retrospective/\"><em>American Babylon</em></a>.
