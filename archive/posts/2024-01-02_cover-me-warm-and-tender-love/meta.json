His original version is one of the most beautiful soul ballads of the early sixties.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Warm And Tender Love   Joe Haywood original version\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LAOZgoMg-Gk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>It didn&#8217;t, though, and when the great Percy Sledge released his own version shortly after as the follow-up to his smash hit &#8220;When a Man Loves a Woman,&#8221; it became Sledge&#8217;s second consecutive Top 20 hit and an enduring romantic soul classic.</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBXAY8tvYKs&#038;pp=ygUicGVyY3kgc2xlZGdlIHdhcm0gYW5kIHRlbmRlciBsb3ZlIA%3D%3D</p>\n<p>The irony is that Haywood didn&#8217;t mean &#8220;Warm and Tender Love&#8221; to be a romantic song when he wrote it shortly after the birth of his daughter in 1960. That&#8217;s right: &#8220;Warm and Tender Love&#8221; was conceived as a father/daughter song.\u00a0 (It&#8217;s likely that Haywood tweaked the lyrics a bit before recording it, though.)</p>\n<p>Still,\u00a0&#8220;Warm and Tender Love&#8221; helped cement Sledge&#8217;s R&amp;B immortality, while Haywood is so forgotten that he doesn&#8217;t even have a Wikipedia entry, despite a string of gorgeous recordings. (Go seek them out on YouTube if you haven&#8217;t heard them.)</p>\n<p>So it was almost certainly Sledge&#8217;s version that Bruce was familiar with, and the one he had in mind when he covered it in 1993.</p>\n<p>Well, <em>sort of</em> covered it. Bruce never actually played &#8220;Warm and Tender Love&#8221; in concert, but during the soundcheck for his first show of 1993, a benefit concert at the Count Basie Theater in Red Bank, Bruce started with a seemingly impromptu &#8220;Warm and Tender Love.&#8221; Thankfully, someone was on hand with a camera, and we can actually watch that performance.</p>\n<p>Pay attention to the clip\u00a0 below, and you&#8217;ll notice something subtle but very significant in Bruce&#8217;s cover..</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen Warm and Tender Love\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/olIt2rI2IcE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Did you notice? Bruce actually rewrote the lyrics. Both Haywood&#8217;s and Sledge&#8217;s versions are pledges, but Bruce&#8217;s is a plea. Instead of asking his partner to let him wrap her in his love, he asks her to love him instead. He even changed the verses to suit the song&#8217;s new message.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s always been a mystery to me why Bruce re-wrote &#8220;Warm and Tender Love&#8221; but never performed it. I highly doubt that it was an improvised on-the-spot performance; Bruce seemed comfortable and confident with his lyrics, as if he&#8217;d sung it that way many times before.</p>\n<p>To this day, we&#8217;ve never heard Bruce perform this immortal classic in concert, so what could have been a standout performance remains an intimate curiosity, thankfully captured on video for posterity.</p>\n<p><strong>Warm and Tender Love<br />\nFirst performed:</strong> March 23, 1993 (Red Bank, NJ) (soundcheck only)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> March 23, 1993 (Red Bank, NJ)
