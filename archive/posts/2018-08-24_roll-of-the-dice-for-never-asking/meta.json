It&#8217;s not always a matter of not being able to fit a complete line, so I wonder why Bruce chose that particular format only for the first four verses.</p>\n<p>Format aside, the lyrics reflect darkness, sadness, isolation, and alienation&#8211;not necessarily extraordinary themes for a teenager, but with the benefit of hindsight and our knowledge of Bruce&#8217;s lifelong battle with depression, &#8220;For Never Asking&#8221; screams at us from the past like a cry for help, or at least a young man grappling to understand what&#8217;s happening in his mind:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Grayish skies choked with rain</em><br />\n<em>cloud my head and turn away</em><br />\n<em>Even as time passes by</em><br />\n<em>life goes on, from lie to lie</em><br />\n<em>but someday I will fly</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>The darkened room I dwell within</em><br />\n<em>smiles at me gently &#8211; &#8220;won&#8217;t you please come in?&#8221;</em><br />\n<em>Then binds me in its iron chains</em><br />\n<em>never to let me go again</em><br />\n<em>my tears will have all run dry</em></p>\n<p>If that&#8217;s not an explicit description of a descent into depression, I can&#8217;t imagine what one would sound like.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Then I hear a knock on the door</em><br />\n<em>open it to find a Union sword</em><br />\n<em>with a finger pointing straight at me</em><br />\n<em>when everything just ceased to be</em><br />\n<em>&#8220;come kill with us, my friend&#8221;</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>The Great Society jumps and screams</em><br />\n<em>but its not really what it seems</em><br />\n<em>it runs down the alley and calls my name</em><br />\n<em>wants me to play its silly games</em><br />\n<em>but no, no, no, not I</em></p>\n<p>Bruce calls upon two historical metaphors here, referring first to the U.S. Civil War (being conscripted to fight alongside the Union army) and then to President Johnson&#8217;s Great Society, which by 1968 had experienced a Republican backlash and was being pared back by President Nixon.</p>\n<p>Both examples are rooted in political, cultural, and class rifts, and Bruce doesn&#8217;t so much declare a position as he opts out of having one. He&#8217;s struggling to figure out who he is and what he believes, free of influence from one side or the other:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Let me hear what I have to hear</em><br />\n<em>Let me see what I have to see</em><br />\n<em>Let me feel what I have to feel</em><br />\n<em>Let me be what I have to be</em><br />\n<em>without you</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Man clown, up down</em><br />\n<em>which way am I flowing?</em><br />\n<em>Man clown, up down</em><br />\n<em>which way is my life rowing, rowing?</em></p>\n<p>Bruce gets no answers to his questions, though, and he returns to his alienation, feeling the clown, unable to escape but determined to someday:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>The circus has arrived in town</em><br />\n<em>children see the funny clown</em><br />\n<em>Find the man behind the grin</em><br />\n<em>he will never let you in</em><br />\n<em>for nothing ever really sinks in to help you</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Grayish skies scarred by the sun</em><br />\n<em>scream in anger and start to run</em><br />\n<em>ripped by the spear of its own forgotten lies</em><br />\n<em>it runs for cover but dies, dies, dies</em><br />\n<em>but someday I will fly</em></p>\n<p>&#8220;For Never Asking&#8221; is a stark, sobering song&#8211;we don&#8217;t know what it would have sounded like, but it seems that it was intended as a solo acoustic song. Bruce may never have released it, but it&#8217;s a theme and a battle he would revisit throughout his life and career.</p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
