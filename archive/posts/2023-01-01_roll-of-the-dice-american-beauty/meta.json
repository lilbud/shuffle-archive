If you want to buy it today, you&#8217;ll have to choose between paying collector&#8217;s prices for the vinyl or accepting the inferior sonics of the mp3 format.</p>\n<p>And yet, for a song comprised almost entirely of recycled parts&#8230;.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s something\u00a0<em>there</em>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;American Beauty&#8221; may have been a\u00a0<em>High Hopes\u00a0</em>outtake, but Bruce is on record citing the song as hailing from his time working with Brendan O&#8217;Brien, and it shows.</p>\n<p>&#8220;American Beauty&#8221; sounds and\u00a0<em>feels</em> like everything Bruce was reaching for on\u00a0<em>Magic.</em> That album has some wonderful songs that work simultaneously as intimate relationship songs and pointed political commentary. &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/05/31/roll-of-the-dice-your-own-worst-enemy/\">Your Own Worst Enemy</a>&#8221; is probably the best example from that group of multi-faceted songs.</p>\n<p>But &#8220;American Beauty&#8221; takes it even a step further. Listen to (or read) the lyrics closely:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Everything in your shadow turns to vapor</em><br />\n<em>You pierce my heart like it was paper</em><br />\n<em>Radio&#8217;s crackling with the headlines</em><br />\n<em>Something on your shoulder, winds in the phone line</em><br />\n<em>American beauty will you be mine</em><br />\n<em>Out on this highway counting white lines</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Hot and bloody summer, drifting blue eyes</em><br />\n<em>We&#8217;re in the high grass, I finger your hemline</em><br />\n<em>Boot heels click clacking, honey, when you shine</em><br />\n<em>Autumn blue skies, hair sweet as the southern pines</em><br />\n<em>American beauty forever in time</em><br />\n<em>Out on this highway counting white lines</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Your hand cups your breast, pledging your time</em><br />\n<em>Things we carried, shining skylines</em><br />\n<em>Falling sparrow, sky torn apart</em><br />\n<em>Dark shining arrow, your kiss pierces my heart</em><br />\n<em>American beauty forever mine</em><br />\n<em>Out on this highway counting white lines</em></p>\n<p>What is the American Beauty that Bruce is singing of?</p>\n<p>Is it the natural grandeur of his country&#8217;s scenery, experienced from the open road?</p>\n<p>Is it metaphorical admiration for its values and ideals?</p>\n<p>Or is it his travelling companion that he&#8217;s so taken by, to whom he pledges his everlasting fidelity?</p>\n<p>&#8220;American Beauty&#8221; works on all three levels at once&#8211;so seamlessly, in fact, that I have all three movies playing in my mind whenever I listen to it. And on all three levels, the are hints that the beauty of America is threatened&#8211;never overtly stated, but certainly hinted at through ominous imagery.</p>\n<p>&#8220;American Beauty&#8221;\u00a0<em>must</em> have been a Magic-era composition. In fact, the song works so meticulously well that one wonders if it&#8217;s truly a recycled piece or if it&#8217;s instead an original organ donor. Perhaps Bruce wrote it first and then farmed its parts to the\u00a0<em>Magic, Working on a Dream,</em> and\u00a0<em>High Hopes</em> songs that bear its DNA.</p>\n<p>It must also be said: this song\u00a0<em>rocks</em>.</p>\n<p>Love it or hate it (and it does seem to polarize fans), Bruce&#8217;s vocal performance on &#8220;American Beauty&#8221; ranks among his most distinctive, and the passion and heartache of the narrator drip from every deliberate crack in Bruce&#8217;s voice.</p>\n<p>And the backing track barrels forward with the power of Bruce&#8217;s most ardent anthems.\u00a0 Why Bruce has never performed it in concert boggles my mind.</p>\n<p>(It still drives me crazy that the one and only time the band performed it was during a soundcheck in Charlotte on the day it was released. I was standing outside the building with the record in hand at the very moment it was being performed, and I never got to hear a note.)</p>\n<p>So come on, Bruce: Bring &#8220;American Beauty&#8221; to the stage on your next tour. You couldn&#8217;t have known it when you wrote it, but it&#8217;s more relevant today than ever.</p>\n<p><strong>American Beauty</strong><br />\n<strong>Recorded:</strong> early 2013<br />\n<strong>Released:\u00a0</strong><em>American Beauty</em> (2014)<br />\n<strong>First performed:\u00a0</strong>April 19, 2014 (soundcheck only)<br />\n<strong>Last performed: </strong>April 19, 2014 (soundcheck only)</p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
