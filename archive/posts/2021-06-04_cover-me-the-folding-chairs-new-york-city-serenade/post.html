<p>The Folding Chairs came together three years ago as a six-piece acoustic Irish/folk/bluegrass band based in Italy, and with a background like that, it’s no surprise that their repertoire includes Springsteen covers.</p>
<p>But of all the songs I might have expected a band like this to cover, “New York City Serenade” would not be among them.</p>
<p>It’s a great song, of course–one of Bruce’s finest, in my opinion. But it’s long, complex, and orchestral, and therefore a bit of a challenge to cover, let alone reinterpret. Add to that the challenge of stitching together six musicians recording remotely–not an easy task for a song like this.</p>
<p>But The Folding Chairs were up to the challenge, tackling “New York City Serenade” as their entry for this year’s <a href="https://www.noiespringsteen.com/contest/"><em>Cover Me</em> contest</a>. Their arrangement starts out faithful to Bruce’s original but soon shifts more definitively into the band’s wheelhouse with a bluegrass-inflected arrangement that works beautifully.</p>

<p>Entries are now closed for this year’s <em>Cover Me</em> contest; now the judges face the daunting task of selecting the finalists. With a line-up of great entries like the ones I’ve featured here these last couple of months, that’s not going to be easy.</p>
<p>Stay tuned–more great covers to come.</p>
