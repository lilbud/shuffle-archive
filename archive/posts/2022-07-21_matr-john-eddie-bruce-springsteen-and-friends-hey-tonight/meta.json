So given Bruce Springsteen&#8217;s long-professed admiration for its songwriter John Fogerty, we might wonder why he&#8217;s never covered it in concert.</p>\n<p>Except he has&#8211;five times, in fact. But you couldn&#8217;t have caught most of them unless your kid went to school with Bruce&#8217;s kids, because each performance was at one of the annual fundraising benefits for the Rumson Country Day School, and only parents of students were allowed to attend.</p>\n<p>There was one exception, though. The first time Bruce performed &#8220;Hey Tonight&#8221; was in Sayreville, New Jersey, and if you were a John Eddie Fan you might have been there that night in October 1994 to catch Eddie&#8217;s set at The Playpen.</p>\n<p>And if you stayed through the encores, you&#8217;d have been there when Eddie invited some singer-songwriter friends of his to join him on stage, and you&#8217;d have been stunned when those friends turned out to be\u00a0Greg Kihn, Marshall Crenshaw, Elliott Murphy, and Bruce Springsteen.</p>\n<p>With such an incredible array of talent on stage, whose songs did they choose to play? They chose all covers, of course, starting with CCR&#8217;s 1971 hit single.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - HEY TONIGHT 1994 (audio)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2TAIm_y2JnQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>It&#8217;s a hard-driving performance with traded vocals (we can clearly hear Bruce at the mic at times), and it was a great way to kick off the encore set. (See <a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/04/11/matr-john-eddie-and-bruce-springsteen-bang-a-gong-get-it-on/\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/03/09/matr-bruce-springsteen-john-eddie-and-friends-suspicious-minds/\">here</a> for more of it.) Sadly, though, it was a one-off&#8211;at least for Bruce, who was still five years away from his next rock tour, and another three before he attempted &#8220;Hey Tonight&#8221; again at those RCDS benefits.</p>\n<p>If we&#8217;re lucky, maybe a recording from one of those shows will surface one day.</p>\n<p><strong>Hey Tonight<br />\nFirst performed:</strong> October 21, 1994 (Sayreville,
