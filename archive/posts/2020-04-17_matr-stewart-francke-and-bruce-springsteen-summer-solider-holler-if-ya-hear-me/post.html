<p>This time the spotlight is on Detroit singer/songwriter Stewart Francke. He may not be as well known as Bob Seger, but he can one-up Bob when it comes to studio collaborations with Bruce Springsteen.</p>
<p>Back in 2011, Francke released his <em>Heartless World </em>album, with a lead-off track featuring a very prominent duet vocal by Bruce. “Summer Soldier (Holler If Ya Hear Me)” is about a wounded and dying soldier in the middle east, a soldier given voice by Bruce.</p>

<p>As for how the collaboration came to pass, Francke took the “nothing ventured, nothing gained” approach and sent the song (which he had always envisioned with Bruce’s voice in the call-and-response chorus) to Bruce’s management. The song made its way to Bruce, who admired it and agreed to contribute his vocals.</p>
<p>The result is a beautiful and poignant collaboration from two outstanding singer/songwriters.</p>
