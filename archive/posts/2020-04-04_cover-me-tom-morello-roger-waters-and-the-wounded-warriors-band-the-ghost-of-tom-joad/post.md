On October 16, 2015, Roger Waters staged a benefit concert for MusiCorps, a non-profit that teaches music to wounded warriors.

Five songs into Waters’ nineteen-song set, Roger invited Tom Morello to join him. Roger, Tom, and the Wounded Warriors Band played several classic Pink Floyd songs together, but they made room in the middle of the set for a very special cover.

Springsteen fans are of course familiar with Morello’s contributions to “[The Ghost of Tom Joad](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/10/17/roll-of-the-dice-the-ghost-of-tom-joad/)” — he’s played it with the E Street Band many times and is prominently featured on the studio version on *High Hopes*. You might have even caught him playing it with his band, *Rage Against the Machine*.

But if you’ve never heard Tom Morello play “The Ghost of Tom Joad” with Roger Waters and the Wounded Warriors Band, take a ten-minute break now and watch. Their performance is more than impressive–it’s inspiring, as a song about Tom Joad should be.
