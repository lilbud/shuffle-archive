When Cantor called him to commission an upbeat holiday song, Gillespie had just lost his brother&#8211;as in earlier that same day. He was in no mood to write a happy song.</p>\n<p>But on the subway home, Gillespie found himself flooded with memories of his brother, their childhood, and holidays past. Their mother would often remind them that Santa was always watching and noting whether they&#8217;d been good boys or bad boys. That memory found its way into a lyric.</p>\n<p>Within fifteen minutes (to his probable chagrin), Gillespie had a song, The rest is history: &#8220;Santa Claus Is Comin&#8217; to Town&#8221; became a timeless classic, bringing joy to everyone who heard it. Everyone, that is, except Gillespie, who could never listen to the song without reliving the loss of his dear brother.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Santa Claus Is Comin&#8217; To Town&#8221; went on to be covered by over 200 artists across every decade since its original release, and in 1962 it crossed over into rock and roll when The Four Seasons put their own instantly recognizable stamp on it.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Frankie Valli &amp; The Four Seasons - Santa Claus Is Coming To Town (Official Audio)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6I1WujBgK64?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>But while The Four Seasons might have gained the song a rock foothold, it was Phil Spector and The Crystals who hit upon the arrangement that would endure and influence artists from The Jackson Five to Mariah Carey&#8230; and of course Bruce Springsteen.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"The Crystals - Santa Claus Is Coming to Town (Official Audio)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FK2tcFFB6ZM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>A famous devotee of the Spector sound and the girl groups of the 1960s, Bruce was heavily inspired by The Crystals 1963 version, right down to its spoken-world story introduction.</p>\n<p>Although he&#8217;d been performing it since at least late 1973, it was his December 12, 1975 performance at C.W.
