I know, I know: I skipped a couple of *Roll of the Dice/Cover Me/Meeting Across the River* days this month. What can I say? It’s summer, and outside is calling.

Apologies and fair warning that it may happen again before the summer is out, but for now here’s a bonus post to help me get back on my normal alternate-day publishing schedule.

“Long Way Home” is a short instrumental that Bruce recorded at home on his acoustic guitar during his *Nebraska* period.

Whether Bruce intended to write lyrics for it; whether it was close to finished or an early work-in-progress; whether it evolved into something else or simply fell by the wayside… these are things we do not know. It certainly doesn’t bear any resemblance to any contemporaneous studio tracks.

So at least for now, let’s consider “Long Way Home” a curious artifact that bridged the end of the River Tour and the burst of serious songwriting that yielded Bruce’s classic 1982 solo album.

**Long Way Home  
Recorded:** September 1981 – May 1982
