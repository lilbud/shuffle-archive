<p>I know, I know: I skipped a couple of <em>Roll of the Dice/Cover Me/Meeting Across the River</em> days this month. What can I say? It’s summer, and outside is calling.</p>
<p>Apologies and fair warning that it may happen again before the summer is out, but for now here’s a bonus post to help me get back on my normal alternate-day publishing schedule.</p>
<p>“Long Way Home” is a short instrumental that Bruce recorded at home on his acoustic guitar during his <em>Nebraska </em>period.</p>

<p>Whether Bruce intended to write lyrics for it; whether it was close to finished or an early work-in-progress; whether it evolved into something else or simply fell by the wayside… these are things we do not know. It certainly doesn’t bear any resemblance to any contemporaneous studio tracks.</p>
<p>So at least for now, let’s consider “Long Way Home” a curious artifact that bridged the end of the River Tour and the burst of serious songwriting that yielded Bruce’s classic 1982 solo album.</p>
