“It’s All Right” is one of Curtis Mayfield’s greatest hits, written and recorded in 1963 during his days fronting The Impressions. It gave the band their first crossover hit, peaking at #4 on the Billboard Hot 100 and the top of the Billboard R&B chart.

Bruce pays homage to Mayfield regularly in his encores when he includes “” in “” but for a short time during World Tour 1993, Bruce made “It’s All Right” his final song of the night in a faithful arrangement to the original. It was a sweet, gentle, and communal note to end the show on.
