<p>Technically, “Faster and Louder” qualifies for a <em>Meeting Across the River </em>blog entry, since Bruce does indeed make an appearance with The Dictators on the lead-off track to their 1978 album <em>Bloodbrothers</em>.</p>
<p>Bruce was a big fan of the influential punk band’s first two albums–in fact, he once wore a Dictators tee shirt on stage and dedicated “Born to Run” to them.</p>

<p>So when it turned out the band was recording their third album in the same building where Bruce was mixing <a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/07/05/album-companion-darkness-on-the-edge-of-town/"><em>Darkness on the Edge of Town</em></a>, Bruce stopped by for a visit and ended up on vinyl.</p>
<p>Blink and you’ll miss it, but at about the 2:10 mark, listen closely and you’ll hear Bruce count the band back in for the final chorus.</p>

<p>So yeah, it’s fleeting, but it’s a cool moment in the only collaboration between Bruce Springsteen and The Dictators.</p>
