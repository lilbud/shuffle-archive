<p>Never have I seen a Springsteen cover start with so much promise only to go so horribly wrong.</p>
<p>From <em>Divine Madness</em>, Bette Midler covers Bruce’s slow arrangement of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/06/06/roll-of-the-dice-the-e-street-shuffle/">The E Street Shuffle</a>” that he would occasionally perform in the early-to-mid-seventies, and she actually does a fine job of it… for about two minutes.</p>
