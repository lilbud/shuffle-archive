Oh my.

Never have I seen a Springsteen cover start with so much promise only to go so horribly wrong.

From *Divine Madness*, Bette Midler covers Bruce's slow arrangement of "[The E Street Shuffle](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/06/06/roll-of-the-dice-the-e-street-shuffle/)" that he would occasionally perform in the early-to-mid-seventies, and she actually does a fine job of it... for about two minutes.
