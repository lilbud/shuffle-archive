When I originally published my Kingdom of Days entry for June 28th a year ago, I made mention that much of the footage for Bruce&#8217;s &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/12/25/roll-of-the-dice-dancing-in-the-dark/\">Dancing in Dark</a>&#8221; video was shot on this date in 1984 with actress Courtney Cox and 200 extras. When lifelong Springsteen fan Sandi Pederson read that, she wrote to me and set me straight: Courtney Cox was no actress at the time&#8211;she was a model, one of three used for the video shoot. And in addition to the two hundred extras (which Sandi insists is too low an estimate), there were five local, lucky fans. Sandi should know: she was one of those fans, making her one of only five members of E Street Nation to be in that now iconic video.</em></span></p>\n<p><em style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">I had to know more, and Sandi was generous enough to share her memories and photos from that day with me. And now, a year later, she&#8217;s gracious enough to share them with you, too. Here&#8217;s Sandi&#8217;s first-hand account of what it was like to film &#8220;Dancing in the Dark&#8221; with Bruce Springsteen on June 28-29, 1984.</em></p>\n</div></div>\n<p>It&#8217;s Thursday, June 28, 1984, and it&#8217;s one of the greatest days of my life.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m at the St. Paul Civic Center, and Bruce Springsteen is on-stage performing his latest single, &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/12/25/roll-of-the-dice-dancing-in-the-dark/\">Dancing in the Dark</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m where every fan dreams of being: front and center. With me are Donna, Dave, Ken, and another fan whose name I can&#8217;t recall. Oh, and three models, including Courtney Cox.</p>\n<p>And that&#8217;s it. Other than the extras behind the stage (there had to be a lot more than 200), director Brian De Palma and his crew, the Civic Center is empty.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s going to be a long but amazing day&#8211;the first of many that summer.</p>\n<p>One day, everyone will know Courtney Cox&#8217;s name, but today she&#8217;s just a model from New York. one of three hired for the video. None of them are fans&#8211;in fact, they complain all day long about the length of the shoot and about how they can&#8217;t stand Bruce&#8217;s music.</p>\n<p>Even Courtney, the &#8220;lucky fan&#8221; Bruce invites on stage, is bored and impatient. She&#8217;s vocal with her complaints, and her attitude turns worse when De Palma instructs the models to watch and act more like us fans.\u00a0 Plus she can&#8217;t dance!</p>\n<p>The models may have be uppity, but we fans are grateful to be there. Bruce recognizes that, and at the end of a long day of shooting, he thanks us by putting on an impromptu concert just for us! Bruce and the band play for an hour, closing with &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/12/27/cover-me-detroit-medley/\">Detroit Medley</a>&#8221; &#8212; it&#8217;s a show that almost no one sees, but I do!</p>\n<p>And I have the photo to prove it.
