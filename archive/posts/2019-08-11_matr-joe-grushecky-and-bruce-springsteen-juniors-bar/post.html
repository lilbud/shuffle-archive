<p>Buried in the middle of Side Two of that  is one of the album’s strongest tracks, “Junior’s Bar,” just screaming to be played live.</p>

<p>On March 23, 2014, Grushecky obliged during his joint concert with Bruce, and as a result, we have the one and only Grushecky/Springsteen performance of “Junior’s Bar.” Bruce hangs back on guitar for most of this one, but towards the end he steps up to the mic to provide backing vocals.</p>

<p>IMO, those particular nights (two back-to-back shows) didn’t feature Bruce at his best. He’d just finished the High Hopes Tour, and the tour-closing stand seem to exact a pretty steep toll on him.</p>
<p>Even with a week off to recover and despite a spectacular set list, he seemed less animated on-stage than usual, so I’m holding out hope that Joe and Bruce will give “Junior’s Bar” another go someday–I’d love to be there when they both cut loose on it.</p>
