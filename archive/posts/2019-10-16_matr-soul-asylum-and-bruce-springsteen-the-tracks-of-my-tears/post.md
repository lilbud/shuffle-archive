Bruce Springsteen is such a self-professed fan of Smokey Robinson (both in interviews and on stage), that it's surprising that he doesn't cover him more often. "[The Way You Do the Things You Do](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/11/20/cover-me-the-way-you-do-the-things-you-do/)" certainly got a workout nightly on the Wrecking Ball Tour's "Apollo Medley," but even that was part of a medley rather than a full performance.

But Bruce did once cover one particular greatest hit in full–and it happened via a most unusual team-up.

"The Tracks of My Tears" was a smash hit for Smokey Robinson and The Miracles, stopping just shy of the top spot on the U.S. R&B Chart upon its release in 1965. Today, *Rolling Stone* ranks it all the way at #50 on its 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list, and it's enshrined in both the Grammy Hall of Fame and the U.S. Library of Congress.

"The Tracks of My Tears" wasn't just a hit for The Miracles–both Johnny Rivers and Linda Ronstadt scored Top 40 hits with it as well.

But Bruce didn't touch it on stage until a surprise appearance with Soul Asylum at their 1995 show at Tramps in New York City. The band had been covering "The Tracks of My Tears" as part of their live sets for years, so they were more than ready to rise to the occasion.

Here's that performance, from March 6, 1995:

That was the only time Bruce has ever played Smokey's classic in full, but he did take one more partial run at it during his Asbury Park holiday shows in 2001, when guest-star Elvis Costello sandwiched it into his and Bruce's performance of "[Alison](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/11/08/matr-elvis-costello-and-bruce-springsteen-alison/)." As with the "Apollo Medley," it isn't a full performance, but we at least get a verse and a chorus.
