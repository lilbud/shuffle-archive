Sign of the times: long-time collaborators Bruce and Joe Grushecky now team up over e-mail–seriously.

Written by Joe around the time Trump took office, “That’s What Makes Us Great” has a classic Heartrockers sound, even though it’s a duet between Joe and Bruce. Maybe that’s because Joe had the song recorded before Bruce added his vocals.

Bruce recorded his vocals from his home studios and e-mailed them to Joe. The result: the pointed, defiant resistance anthem below.
