They say that great folk songs are never finished, and that’s certainly the case with Pete Seeger’s “Bring Them Home.”

Seeger wrote “Bring Them Home” in 1966 as a protest against the Vietnam war. He evolved the song over the years that followed, and by the time he performed it on *The Johnny Cash Show* in 1970, Seeger had honed it to a very sharp point.

By today’s standards, that performance might not seem so extraordinary, but airing such an explicitly critical performance on national television in 1970 was quite remarkable.

In 2003, producer Jim Musselman rewrote the first verse of Seeger’s song to update it for a post-9/11 world. Seeger recorded a new version of the song featuring Musselman’s verse with Ani DiFranco, Steve Earle, and Billy Bragg for a compilation released that same year.

Three years later, Bruce took Musselman’s first verse and Seeger’s second verse and then wrote two new verses of his own:

*They wanna test their grand theories*  
*Bring them home, bring them home*  
*With the blood of you and me*  
*Bring them home, bring them home*

*Now we’ll give no more brave young lives*  
*Bring them home, bring them home*  
*For the gleam in someone’s eyes*  
*Bring them home, bring them home*

But Bruce wasn’t done yet–he borrowed and adapted two verses from the standard “When Johnny Comes Marching Home”….

| “When Johnny Comes Marching Home” | “Bring ‘Em Home” |
| --- | --- |
| *The men will cheer and the boys will shout*   *The ladies they will all turn out*   *And we’ll all feel gay*   *When Johnny comes marching home.**The old church bell will peal with joy*   *Hurrah! Hurrah!*   *To welcome home our darling boy,*   *Hurrah! Hurrah!* | *The men will cheer and the boys will shout*   *Bring them home, bring them home*   *Yeah and we will all turn out*   *Bring them home, bring them home**The church bells will ring with joy*   *Bring them home, bring them home*   *To welcome our darling girls and boys*   *Bring them home, bring them home* |


…and then wrote a seventh verse in tribute:

*We will lift their voice and sound*  
*Bring them home, bring them home*  
*Yeah when Johnny comes marching home*  
*Bring them home, bring them home*

It’s hard to call the resulting song a cover, but it’s certainly not an original Springsteen song. There’s no debating its power, however. Although not nearly as angry as Seeger’s original song, Bruce’s version captures the patriotism of Seeger’s original and the longing in “When Johnny Comes Marching Home” to produce a mash-up that perfectly captures the heartache and sacrifice of the families of soldiers overseas.

Bruce recorded his new version of “Bring ‘Em Home” in Oslo while on tour with the Sessions Band in 2006. While never officially released on disc, that studio version was very briefly available as an Internet download, and you can hear it below.

Bruce had already debuted “Bring ‘Em Home” in concert the week prior in Paris. It seemed like it was destined for one-off status, but just three days after he recorded his studio version with the band, Bruce reintroduced it to his setlist, where it remained a fixture throughout the remainder of the American leg of the tour.

By the middle of June, “Bring ‘Em Home” was firmly established in the set, and the audience reaction was predictably and consistently favorable. It’s no surprise that Bruce included a live version (recorded in Detroit on June 17th) as a bonus track on his *American Land Edition* re-issue of *We Shall Overcome* later that year.

Bruce even performed “Bring ‘Em Home” during his television appearance on *Late Night With Conan O’Brien* at the tail end of the American tour.

Bruce retired his version of “Bring ‘Em Home” after the Seeger Sessions Tour concluded, but that certainly won’t be the end of its evolution.

Like all great folk songs, Pete Seeger’s patriotic anti-war song will continue to grow, adapt, and evolve across the years for as long as there are wars that require people to fight them.
