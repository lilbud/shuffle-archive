<p>On July 3, 1988, during a worldwide radio broadcast of his Tunnel of Love show in Stockholm, Bruce announced his participation in an upcoming super-star tour under the aegis of Amnesty International.</p>
<p>The impetus for the <em>Human Rights Now!</em> Tour was the 40th anniversary of the Declaration of Human Rights, and it was a cause that Bruce was pleased to support.</p>
<p>Bruce punctuated the announcement with a gorgeous cover of Bob Dylan’s “Chimes of Freedom,” an appropriate song for the occasion. (Bruce had actually started including it in the set a few days prior.)</p>
<p>Originally released in 1964, “Chimes of Freedom” is the tale of a thunderstorm, one that strikes with rage and ferocity before fading into the distance. As the singer waits out the storm, he imagines that the thunderclaps are the chiming bells of freedom, ushered in by the bolts of lightning representing the untold struggle for freedom in places both close to home and far-flung.</p>

<p>“Chimes of Freedom” isn’t a protest song–it’s a song of solidarity, of brotherhood and sisterhood. It was a perfect anthem for a tour celebrating Human Rights, and it’s fitting that Bruce chose to record this performance and release it as the title track of an EP a month later to promote and support the upcoming tour. Performed in a bold, assertive arrangement, Bruce abbreviated (cutting two verses) and transformed the song into more of an anthem than a musing. Never released as a single, it nevertheless made it to #16 on the Billboard Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart.</p>

<p>Bruce continued to perform “Chimes of Freedom” for the duration of the Tunnel of Love Tour, and when that tour segued into the Amnesty International Tour, he led the assembled artists in an all-star rendition.</p>

<p>Bruce hasn’t performed the song since 1988, but he actually did perform it once long <em>before</em>–on the Darkness Tour, way back in 1978. Take a listen–it’s not anywhere near as strong or as confident as Bruce’s later arrangement, but it’s notable for Bruce’s comments (he cites this as one of his favorite songs from high school), his embarrassment and unease in performing such an idealistic song in such a setting (my, how he’d change in a decade!), and the more classic E Street-sounding arrangement.</p>
