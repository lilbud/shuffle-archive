Identical lines (or nearly so) show up in multiple songs, sometimes across a period of several years.</p>\n<p>But here&#8217;s an example that&#8217;s extreme even by Bruce&#8217;s standards.</p>\n<p>In May of 1966, Bruce Springsteen was only sixteen years old. He was already in his first band, though&#8211;a combo called the Castiles.</p>\n<p>Not only was Bruce in a band, he was also ready to start songwriting. On the way to his very first-ever studio session, he and bandmate George Theiss co-wrote two songs in the car on the way to the session. The first, &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/12/19/roll-of-the-dice-baby-i/\">Baby I</a>&#8221; would eventually be released a full half-century later on <em>Chapter and Verse</em>. The latter, however, still hasn&#8217;t seen the light of day.</p>\n<p>That second song was called &#8220;That&#8217;s What You Get,&#8221; and while it may not have been officially released, we&#8217;re lucky enough to have a leaked version of it from a surviving acetate. In the clip below, George Theiss sings lead vocals (as he did on &#8220;Baby I&#8221; as well), but Bruce is very much in the mix.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen and the Castiles: That&#039;s What You Get (studio version)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_1ET0kehXbg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>The fidelity isn&#8217;t exactly high&#8211;I can&#8217;t even make out all the lyrics&#8211;but we can hear enough of &#8220;That&#8217;s What You Get&#8221; to register a shockingly early example of one of Bruce&#8217;s songwriting trademarks: seriously dark lyrics paired with uptempo&#8211;almost pop&#8211;backing tracks.</p>\n<p>In fact, we learn in the very first verse that the singer&#8217;s girl is dead, and that it&#8217;s his fault&#8211;but she should have known better anyway:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>The moonlight dances on her face</em><br />\n<em>I got my lips ???</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;m living the life of a lie</em><br />\n<em>It was for me, for me that she died</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>That&#8217;s what you get for loving me</em></p>\n<p>But it&#8217;s the second verse that rings with familiarity for Springsteen fans&#8211;listen to it again if you missed it the first time:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>True love, unhappiness</em><br />\n<em>I fall down on my knees and I cry</em><br />\n<em>It&#8217;s my way of saying goodbye</em></p>\n<p>It would take another eighteen years, but that middle line would eventually make it (in slightly modified form) to an official release via &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/01/22/roll-of-the-dice-downbound-train/\">Downbound Train.</a>&#8221;</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s believed that Bruce and The Castiles likely played &#8220;That&#8217;s What You Get&#8221; live throughout 1966 and 1967, but no document survives to confirm that. Not only does this recording stand as the only confirmed performance of one of Bruce&#8217;s earliest songs, it&#8217;s tied with &#8220;Baby I&#8221; as the earliest known recording of a Bruce Springsteen performance.</p>\n<p><strong>That&#8217;s What You Get<br />\nRecorded:</strong> May 18, 1966<br />\n<strong>Never released</strong><br />\n<strong>First performed:</strong> unconfirmed<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> unconfirmed</p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
