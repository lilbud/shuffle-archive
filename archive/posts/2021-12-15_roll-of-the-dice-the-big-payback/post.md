meta-description: “The Big Payback” is a Nebraska-era B-side obscurity, as tight, taut, and sinister as anything on the album it didn’t make but a whole lot more fun to sing.

Talk about an obscurity: “The Big Payback” is one of the least-known officially released Springsteen songs.

That’s probably because it was an afterthought of sorts to , recorded (along with ““) in 1981, a few months after the rest of the songs that formed Bruce’s first acoustic album.

*Nebraska*[My Father’s House](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/08/13/roll-of-the-dice-my-fathers-house/)

It didn’t make the album, but Bruce released it in 1982 as the B-side to the the single for “” (a great pairing, and yes did spawn singles).

[Open All Night](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/10/28/roll-of-the-dice-open-all-night/)*Nebraska*

A decade later, Bruce released it as B-side–this time for “Leap of Faith.” Why? I have no idea.

*another*

And finally, more than a decade after Bruce finally put this dark, deceptively upbeat rockabilly outtake on an album… on the “bonus disc” of the limited-edition version of .

*that,* *The Essential Bruce Springsteen*

Geez. You’d think the guy was embarrassed about the song or something. It’s not as if it couldn’t have fit on it’s not even two minutes long! But the most likely reason for “The Big Payback” not making it onto is that it’s too close in sound to “Open All Night.” The two songs start out virtually identically, in fact. Take a listen to the A-side:

*Nebraska–**Nebraska*

…and now listen to the B-side:

I’d argue that “The Big Payback” is just as taut and edgy as “Open All Night” but even more fun to sing along to.

In typical Nebraska fashion, “The Big Payback” features an anti-hero, but it’s a slow burn until we realize that. At first, we think we’re just being introduced to another of Bruce’s stock working stiff characters:

*I bought a scooter and I rented a shack*  
*Out in the sun by the railroad track*  
*I got a job and I’m a-breaking my back*  
*Working and working for the big payback*



*I keep a-putting and a-puttin’ out*  
*I keep a-sweating like all get out*  
*I work so long that I’m a-losing track*  
*Waiting waiting on the big payback*

Our narrator, Bobby (we’ll soon learn his name), is doing hard, honest labor with the expectation of a big payday. But it never comes. His job uses him, drains him, and he knows it will someday discard him like a cheap one-night stand once it’s taken all it can take from him:

*Well it’s a wham-bam, thank you ma’am, goddamn, look out Sam*  
*It’s a gone dead train rumbling down this track*  
*They got your neck in the noose, you’re dragging long in back*  
*Chasing and chasing the big payback*

Now it’d be one thing if Bobby had some solidarity out there on the line. But he seems to be on his own, sweating and toiling while his foreman… well, I’m pretty sure we don’t need Urban Dictionary to tell us what “diddy wack wack” is in reference to. (But I’m dying to know how Bruce came up with the phrase.)

*Oh what my foreman does well I don’t know*  
*He just throws me a shovel and yells “Go, Bobby, Go”*  
*Oh well-a all day long he’s just a diddy wack wack*  
*While I’m sweating and sweating for the big payback*



*Yeah it’s a wham bam, thank you ma’am, god damn, look out Sam*  
*It’s a gone dead train rumbling down the track*  
*They got your neck in the noose, your hands are tied up in back*  
*And you’re a-working and working for the big payback*

And now the song turns sinister, both lyrically and vocally:

*I quit that job and Mister I ain’t going back*  
*Got me a knife and she’s a long and black*  
*I’ll tell you how I make my piece at night Mac*  
*Down in the alley of the big payback*

Bobby’s looking for the easy money now, lying in wait in a dark alley with long knife. And those “gone dead train” and “neck in the noose” metaphors… well, they don’t seem so metaphorical now that they’re turned around:

*I go a wham bam, thank you ma’am, god damn, c’mon man*  
*You’re a gone dead train rumbling down this track*  
*I got your neck in the noose and I don’t give a damn Jack*  
*I’m on that long lost highway of the big payback*

Bobby repeats that last line as the song fades, heading farther down the dark path he’s chosen, paying back the world in violence for the perceived injustice done to him.

Like I said: this is material through and through. It’s also some of Bruce’s best songwriting: tight, taut, deceptively slight and increasingly sinister.

*Nebraska*

“The Big Payback” deserves a lot more exposure than it gets. Bruce has never once played it in concert–not even during the Ghost of Tom Joad Tour, where it would have worked nicely. And while we don’t have a full-band arrangement to listen to, it’s not hard to imagine the E Street Band having a ton of fun with it on stage.

So maybe Bruce will someday remember about “The Big Payback” and give Bobby a chance to make it big on stage. But given Bobby’s bad luck and karma, it’s more likely he’ll stay condemned to lurking in the dark alleys of B-sides and bonus discs.
