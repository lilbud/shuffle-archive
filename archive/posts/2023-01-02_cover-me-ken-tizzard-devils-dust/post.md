“I have never been to war,” he wrote on . “I have never had to make the choices that people have had to make in war. I have never killed another person, or watch my friends be killed in battle. I cannot understand the fear, sadness, and the emotional weight of such an event.

Tizzard’s cover is a deeply empathic one and a great example of how music helps us understand a world much bigger than our own place in it.
