**1969:** Child reluctantly plays a gig at The Student Prince in Asbury Park. Why reluctantly? Because Woodstock was happening at the same time, and that’s where the band wants to be–but they honor their commitment.

**1973:** Bruce cancels a scheduled show in East Paterson, New Jersey, to make room for recording sessions for his second album.

**1975:** On the fourth of five legendary nights at New York City’s Bottom Line club on the Born to Run Tour, Bruce debuts his cover of “[It’s Gonna Work Out Fine](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/01/02/cover-me-its-gonna-work-out-fine/)” at the first of two shows that night.
