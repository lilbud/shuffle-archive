title: Dream Baby (How Long Must I Dream)

I’ve shared a few songs from Bruce’s 1987 appearance as a member of Roy Orbison’s all-star backing band (see “The Comedians,” Blue Angel,” “,” and “Go Go Go (Down the Line)” for the others), but this one’s special for two reasons.

*Black and White Night*[Leah](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/04/08/matr-roy-orbison-bruce-springsteen-and-friends-leah/)

First, because Bruce apparently thought enough of “Dream Baby (How Long Must I Dream)” to try adapting it in a new arrangement (a la “Follow That Dream”) during his home recording sessions:

…and second, because it’s the one song from where Roy was able to coax Bruce out from his supporting role and over to the center mic for some shared vocals.

*Black and White Night*

If their chemistry doesn’t win you over immediately, it will by the time Bruce shrugs at the three-minute mark.

(And yes, if you found yourself thinking “Is that…” all throughout the video, the answer is yes, that was exactly who you think it was, each and every band member. It’s an all-star band, remember?)

Roy’s original 1962 single ranks as one of his greatest hits, both then (it peaked at #4 in the U.S. and #2 in the U.K.) and now.
