Lisa Lowell is familiar name to E Street Nation. Her vocals can be found all over Bruce’s nineties-forward catalog (“,” “,” and “” to name but a few), and she was a featured background singer on the Seeger Sessions Tour.

After Lisa lent her support to a cool dozen of Bruce’s released tracks (plus three of Patti’s), Bruce decided to return the favor, playing electric guitar on her sultry track “The Moulin Rouge” on Lisa’s album.

Written in the 1980s (which explains the Billy Idol reference) when her band Venus Flytrap (which included E Streeter Soozie Tyrell) had an extended stay in Paris, “The Moulin Rouge” exudes sex, and Bruce’s tight, restrained guitar work helps keep the heat on high.

Too bad they’ve never performed it together live.
