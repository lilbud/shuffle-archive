On April 20, 2010, the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig exploded, spilling more than 210 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico in what would become one of the biggest environmental disasters in American history.

Not long after, Pete Seeger and Lorre Wyatt wrote a song in response, referencing the disaster: “God’s Counting on Me… God’s Counting on You.”

As serendipity would have it, just as they’d completed writing the song, Seeger received a call from rocker Richard Barone, asking him if he’d consider participating in a benefit concert in New York City. Seeger agreed, performing his new song for Barone on the spot over the phone.

After the concert, Barone produced a recording of “God’s Counting on Me… God’s Counting on You” performed while sailing on the Hudson River Sloop Clearwater, with both Seeger and Wyatt on vocals.

(There’s a fascinating [Tape Op interview with Barone](https://tapeop.com/interviews/113/pete-seeger/) in which he describes in much detail the recording process and experience–I highly recommend reading it if you’re interested.)

Seeger and Barone decided to release the track as a single through Appleseed records, but there was enough traffic on the label’s release runway to delay the song’s release until 2012. In the meantime, Appleseed had Bruce Springsteen contribute vocals to the track in January 2012, and he can be heard prominently singing lead on two verses of the final track below.

The track was finally released in September 2012 on a new album by Seeger and Wyatt called *A More Perfect Union*, and as a single on Election Day 2012.

“God’s Counting on Me… God’s Counting on You” became Seeger’s final single of his long and storied career, and his last collaboration with Bruce Springsteen.
