<p>But all three songs (“Don’t Say No” “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/03/07/roll-of-the-dice-i-want-to-be-wild/">I Want to Be Wild</a>,” and “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/05/20/roll-of-the-dice-out-on-the-run/">Out on the Run</a>“) remain unreleased–and as far as we know, unfinished–to this day.</p>
<p>But since Bruce tried so hard to make a go of it, let’s give “Don’t Say No” a listen anyway. I’ll warn you, though: Bruce’s vocals are very, <em>very</em> deep in the mix, so you may need the lyrics below (such as they are, and such as I can interpret) to follow along.</p>

<p>Barreling out of the gate on the back of Max’s “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/10/31/roll-of-the-dice-night/">Night</a>“-ish intro, “Don’t Say No” quickly settles into a hard rocking riff that really should have ended up somewhere in Bruce’s catalog. The E Street Band gets a workout here, which helps hide the fact that Bruce’s bluffed lyrics are barely intelligible.</p>
<p>Thanks to folks at Springsteenlyrics.com, we’ve got at least something to go on, but honestly I think much of the lyrics listed for this song are just bluffed nonsense, so I took the liberty of removing the lines I don’t think are actually on the song and don’t match what I hear. (You can check out their lyrics page <a href="https://www.springsteenlyrics.com/lyrics.php?song=dontsayno">here</a>, though, if you want to read what they hear).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>I remember, girl, you were walking down my street</em><br/>
<em>Well, you were ??? I’d seen my baby</em><br/>
<em>You know she loves him and I can’t beat her style</em><br/>
<em>Right now I wanna ???</em><br/>
<em>Bring it home, try it out, I’ll do just whatever you want</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Don’t say no!</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>???</em><br/>
<em>???</em><br/>
<em>But I’m a real live wire and I’m feeling right outside</em><br/>
<em>Right now I’ll get down on my knees, you know I’m wild</em><br/>
<em>???</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Don’t say no!</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>There’s a cool river and a color and fire when I came here</em><br/>
<em>Well I’ve been on that high road searching for you</em><br/>
<em>And I love you girl and I want you girl and I swear</em><br/>
<em>Even when you’re lonesome, baby, I’m beside you</em><br/>
<em>I’m your captive, I’m a little downside</em><br/>
<em>Ah, and I want you and I’m gonna get you and I’m gonna treat you and I’m gonna love you</em><br/>
<em>Alright, I’m ready to rip, open up and then bring it home</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Don’t say no!</em></p>
<p>In any event, even the lyrics that we can make out make it clear that “Don’t Say No” was never going to end up on <em><a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/07/05/album-companion-darkness-on-the-edge-of-town/">Darkness on the Edge of Town</a>. </em>Despite being rehearsed during that album’s sessions, “Don’t Say No” is more <em>The River</em> than <em>Darkness</em>. Had Bruce developed it into a final song, however, it would have made a fine candidate for <em>The Promise</em>.</p>
