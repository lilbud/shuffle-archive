Bruce really, really, *really* wanted to find a home for the instrumental track that backs his unreleased song, “Don’t Say No.” He used it not once but twice in 1977–and then a third time in 1979.

But all three songs (“Don’t Say No” “[I Want to Be Wild](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/03/07/roll-of-the-dice-i-want-to-be-wild/),” and “[Out on the Run](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/05/20/roll-of-the-dice-out-on-the-run/)“) remain unreleased–and as far as we know, unfinished–to this day.

But since Bruce tried so hard to make a go of it, let’s give “Don’t Say No” a listen anyway. I’ll warn you, though: Bruce’s vocals are very, *very* deep in the mix, so you may need the lyrics below (such as they are, and such as I can interpret) to follow along.

Barreling out of the gate on the back of Max’s “[Night](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/10/31/roll-of-the-dice-night/)“-ish intro, “Don’t Say No” quickly settles into a hard rocking riff that really should have ended up somewhere in Bruce’s catalog. The E Street Band gets a workout here, which helps hide the fact that Bruce’s bluffed lyrics are barely intelligible.

Thanks to folks at Springsteenlyrics.com, we’ve got at least something to go on, but honestly I think much of the lyrics listed for this song are just bluffed nonsense, so I took the liberty of removing the lines I don’t think are actually on the song and don’t match what I hear. (You can check out their lyrics page [here](https://www.springsteenlyrics.com/lyrics.php?song=dontsayno), though, if you want to read what they hear).

*I remember, girl, you were walking down my street*  
*Well, you were ??? I’d seen my baby*  
*You know she loves him and I can’t beat her style*  
*Right now I wanna ???*  
*Bring it home, try it out, I’ll do just whatever you want*

*Don’t say no!*

*???*  
*???*  
*But I’m a real live wire and I’m feeling right outside*  
*Right now I’ll get down on my knees, you know I’m wild*  
*???*

*Don’t say no!*

*There’s a cool river and a color and fire when I came here*  
*Well I’ve been on that high road searching for you*  
*And I love you girl and I want you girl and I swear*  
*Even when you’re lonesome, baby, I’m beside you*  
*I’m your captive, I’m a little downside*  
*Ah, and I want you and I’m gonna get you and I’m gonna treat you and I’m gonna love you*  
*Alright, I’m ready to rip, open up and then bring it home*

*Don’t say no!*

In any event, even the lyrics that we can make out make it clear that “Don’t Say No” was never going to end up on *[Darkness on the Edge of Town](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/07/05/album-companion-darkness-on-the-edge-of-town/).* Despite being rehearsed during that album’s sessions, “Don’t Say No” is more *The River* than *Darkness*. Had Bruce developed it into a final song, however, it would have made a fine candidate for *The Promise*.

**Don’t Say No  
Recorded:** November 1977  
**Never released**
