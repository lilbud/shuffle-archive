The &#8220;Asian Flu&#8221; (so called because it originated in Singapore) was responsible for about two million deaths worldwide, and given the world&#8217;s population at the time, that wasn&#8217;t that far behind COVID-19&#8217;s toll.</p>\n<p>New Orleans-based rock and roll pioneer Huey &#8220;Piano&#8221; Smith thought that sounded like a pretty great idea for a song.</p>\n<p>And I suppose he was right, because &#8220;Rockin&#8217; Pneumonia and the Boogie Woogie Flu&#8221; became a decent-sized hit that summer, even though Smith released it right when the pandemic reached the United States, and even though the highest death toll was among teenagers and young twenty-somethings, the primary audience for rock and roll.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Huey Piano Smith   Rockin&#039; Pneumonia And The Boogie Woogie Flu\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KKjhLq4NXIE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;Rockin&#8217; Pneumonia&#8221; (a play on &#8220;walking pneumonia&#8221;) peaked at #52 in sales but went all the way to #5 on the R&amp;B radio play chart.

If you ask me, it&#8217;s all about the loose, good-time New Orleans sound. Listen to either Smith&#8217;s or Rivers&#8217; version and you&#8217;ll hear performances so loose they&#8217;re almost a drunken stumble. One gets the sense that no two performances of &#8220;Rockin&#8217; Pneumonia and the Boogie Woogie Flu&#8221; are ever the same, which makes it a perfect song for Bruce Springsteen to cover.</p>\n<p>Bruce has covered &#8220;Rockin&#8217; Pnemonia&#8221; three times only. Each of those three was (appropriately) at a bar, and each was (amazingly) captured on video.</p>\n<p>His debut performance was a surprise appearance with Clarence Clemons and The Red Bank Rockers at Tradewinds in Sea Bright in the summer of 1993.&nbsp;Bruce had just wrapped his world tour with his new band only days before, and it was a thrill to see The Boss and The Big Man reunited on stage again. &#8220;Rockin&#8217; Pneumonia&#8221; was the first song Bruce played with Clarence and his band that night, and you can feel the crowd&#8217;s excitement in the video of that performance below.</p>\n<div id=\"v-uLaR1TNE-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='572' src='https://videopress.com/embed/uLaR1TNE?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>The other times Bruce covered &#8220;Rockin&#8217; Pneumonia&#8221; were far more recent, and both were with Danny Clinch&#8217;s Tangiers Blues Band&#8211;first at the Asbury Lanes re-opening celebration in 2018&#8230;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Rockin &#039;Pneumonia and the Boogie Woogie Flu- Bruce Springsteen (17-06-2018  Asbury Lanes,New Jersey)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GHODh4pGWOc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8230;and again ten months later at the annual Kristen Ann Carr Fund benefit at Tribeca Grill in New York City.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Rockin\u2019 Pneumonia and the Boogie Woogie Flue - Bruce Springsteen (13-04-2019 Tribeca Grill,NY)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WSIL3Hs68eU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Each of the three performances featured Bruce in fine improvisational form with top-notch bands, appreciative crowds, and perfect barroom settings.</p>\n<p>Will we ever see him play it again?
