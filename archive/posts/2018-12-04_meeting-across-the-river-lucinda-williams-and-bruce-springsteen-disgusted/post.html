<p>“Disgusted” was recorded by Melvin “Lil’ Son” Jackson back in 1951, but it remained in the vault for years, finally seeing the light of day on a 1968 compilation album.</p>

<p>Lucinda Williams has covered it in concert over the decades, too many times to count; she even included a live performance of it on as a bonus track on her 1998 reissue of her self-titled third album.</p>

<p>When Lucinda’s 2006 tour intersected with Bruce’s Seeger Sessions Tour in London, Bruce made a surprise guest appearance, joining Lucinda’s band for two songs. One of those songs–Lucinda’s own “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/06/25/matr-lucinda-williams-and-bruce-springsteen-joy/">Joy</a>“–has been floating around youtube for many years.</p>
<p>The other song, however, is much harder to find for some reason. So here it is, newly uploaded–enjoy Bruce’s only known performance of “Disgusted.” (He plays guitar only, no vocals.)</p>
