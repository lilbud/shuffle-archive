Anyway, Jackie Wilson&#8217;s &#8220;Higher and Higher&#8221; has always been that song for me. Seriously, this post is taking me forever to write, because I keep replaying it.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Jackie Wilson - (Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher And Higher (Best Quality)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mzDVaKRApcg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;Higher and Higher&#8221; was a huge hit for Wilson, peaking at #6 on the Hot 100 and reaching the top spot on the U.S. R&amp;B chart. It was a hit in the UK, too&#8211;charting in the top 20\u00a0<em>twice</em>, once in 1969 and once in 1987&#8211;and Rolling Stone considers it one of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. So yeah, it&#8217;s pretty great.</p>\n<p>But that bolt of lightning almost didn&#8217;t strike: &#8220;Higher and Higher&#8221; was first recorded by The Dells, although it wasn&#8217;t released until 1968, after Wilson&#8217;s version had become a hit. The Dells&#8217; version features different lyrics, a different title, a different tempo and plays more like a late-sixties R&amp;B ballad (which it basically is).</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"[Your Love Has Lifted Me] Higher And Higher\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yOETOx5Mi5o?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>The Dells had already recorded their version when writer Gary Jackson tweaked the original (written by\u00a0Carl Smith and Raynard Miner) and sold producer Carl Davis on it. Davis had a vision of the song in his head, but Wilson wasn&#8217;t delivering on it&#8211;he&#8217;d heard The Dells&#8217; version and was singing more in that vein.\u00a0 After delivering some coaching to Wilson (and standing ready to record it himself if necessary), Wilson nailed his vocal in one take.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Higher and Higher&#8221; went on to become one of Wilson&#8217;s best-known songs, earning a posthumous re-release&#8211;and unfortunately, a video&#8211;in 1987.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Jackie Wilson - Higher &amp; Higher Official Video\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/AIy6X4VTWpk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Let&#8217;s try to pretend we didn&#8217;t see that one&#8211;Wilson deserves better.</p>\n<p>Anyway, Jackie Wilson was one of the most dynamic performers to grace a stage, with some of the best moves. His knee drops and falsetto flourishes are not unfamiliar to Springsteen fans&#8211;it&#8217;s clear that Wilson was an influence on Bruce&#8217;s stagecraft.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Jackie Wilson performing Higher And Higher\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/k1odvp-_bhk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>It&#8217;s not surprising in the least that &#8220;Higher and Higher&#8221; turned up in Bruce&#8217;s setlists in 1977. It&#8217;s only surprising that he seemed to forget about it for more than two decades afterward. Here&#8217;s Bruce&#8217;s first ever performance of &#8220;Higher and Higher,&#8221; from the closing stand of his 1977 tour in Boston, complete with the Miami Horns. It&#8217;s a joyous rave-up that never loses its power.</p>\n<div id=\"v-5budtv00-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='426' src='https://videopress.com/embed/5budtv00?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>Bruce played &#8220;Higher and Higher&#8221; a couple of times at one-off &#8217;77 shows after the tour ended (along with a <a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/09/05/kingdom-of-days-september-5/\">1981 guest appearance with The Pretenders</a>), but after that the song was MIA for more than twenty years.</p>\n<p>And then: on October 20, 2009, just as Bruce was about to wrap the main set at the very last show Bruce would ever play at the Philadelphia Spectrum, a brilliant fan (to whom I owe a beer if I ever run into him or her at a show) held up a sign, caught Bruce&#8217;s eye, and&#8230;</p>\n<p>Well you&#8217;ll just need to watch. And you really should, because this may be the single most joyous, spontaneous Springsteen moment I&#8217;ve ever seen (virtually, alas) at a show. Watch the looks between Bruce and Steve as they get rolling&#8211;they know full well what&#8217;s about to break loose. And Bruce&#8230; let&#8217;s just say Jackie Wilson was alive that night.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Springsteen - Higher and Higher - The Spectrum October 20, 2009\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DytO5K0rPu8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>That was an inspired request, and an inspired performance&#8211;and Bruce knew it, because a week later, at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#8217;s 25th Anniversary Concert, Bruce reprised it with an all-star slate of performers to close out the show. Check it out below&#8211;it&#8217;s a veritable E Street Family and Friends Reunion.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen, John Fogerty &amp; All Star Band - (Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher And Higher\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-E-cXeRzMpc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;Higher and Higher&#8221; was a standard encore for the remainder of the Working on a Dream Tour, and it&#8217;s popped up a couple of times since, the last time in 2015.
