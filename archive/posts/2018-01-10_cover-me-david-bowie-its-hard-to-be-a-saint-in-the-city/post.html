<p>Two years gone to the day, but his music lives on. Enjoy one of the earliest covers of a Bruce Springsteen song (and a darn good one): David Bowie’s cover of “<a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/10/21/roll-of-the-dice-its-hard-to-be-a-saint-in-the-city/">It’s Hard to Be a Saint in the City.</a>”</p>

<p>Bowie recorded this in 1974, but it languished in the vaults until he released it on his <em>Sound + Vision </em>box set in 1989.</p>
<p>Although Bowie recorded this very early in Bruce’s career, it was actually the second time he’d recorded one of Bruce’s songs. (<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/01/07/cover-me-david-bowie-growin-up/">The first</a> was “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/09/29/roll-of-the-dice-growin-up/">Growin’ Up.</a>“)</p>
<p>And the two icons hadn’t even met yet! For the story of that first meeting, see <a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/11/25/kingdom-of-days-november-25/">that day’s Kingdom of Days entry</a>.</p>
