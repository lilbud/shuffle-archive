<p>And then there’s “30 Days Out.”</p>
<p>It didn’t make the <em>Human Touch</em> album it was recorded for, and it never made it into the vault for a <em>Tracks</em> release. Instead, it slipped out the door when no one was looking, hitched a ride on the b-side of a “Leap of Faith” promo single, and took off for Austria, The Netherlands, Japan, and Australia–the only countries that ever saw anything resembling an official release for this song.</p>
<p>I’m mystified, because “30 Days Out” is a darn good song, stronger than many of the songs that made it to the album.</p>

<p>Musically, “30 Days Out” suffers from the same overproduction that plagues <em>Human Touch. </em>(There’s an album I’d love to see Bruce completely re-record some day.) But it grooves, the lyrics are catchy, and Bruce’s vocals are at his peak, some of his purest on record.</p>
<p>Perhaps the reason Bruce cast this song off is that lyrically, it’s ground well trod for him:</p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;"><em>We fell in love and I made you the world</em><br/>
<em>I spent all my time trying to satisfy you, girl</em><br/>
<em>Just one thing that I can’t figure out</em><br/>
<em>Closer I get, farther baby I am out</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Thirty days, thirty days out</em><br/>
<em>Well I’m six days running but I’m thirty days out</em><br/>
<em>Thirty days, thirty days out</em><br/>
<em>With every kiss you leave a little shadow of doubt</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The roof was leaking honey where we live</em><br/>
<em>And I’m wondering what’s that something that you won’t give</em><br/>
<em>I started loving you but I gotta stop</em><br/>
<em>You got me mostly waiting for that other shoe to drop</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Tried to talk about what’s going on</em><br/>
<em>You just smile and tell me “Baby there ain’t nothing wrong”</em><br/>
<em>In your smile there’s a sign in red</em><br/>
<em>It said “Thousand miles of hard road dead ahead”</em></p>
<p>The notion of the mysterious girl he can never quite please–who remains just emotionally out of reach even though she professes otherwise–that’s familiar territory in the vein of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/06/05/roll-of-the-dice-im-goin-down/">I’m Goin’ Down</a>,” “<a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/02/06/roll-of-the-dice-brilliant-disguise/">Brilliant Disguise</a>” and “<a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/05/30/roll-of-the-dice-secret-garden/">Secret Garden</a>.” Even “<a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/08/17/roll-of-the-dice-one-step-up/">One Step Up</a>” compares in its titular hook and its ain’t-burning furnace vs. the leaky roof in “30 Days Out.”</p>
<p>Perhaps Bruce felt he’d gone to that well a bit too often; regardless, “30 Days Out” deserves rediscovery and airtime in concert. (Bruce has never performed it live.)</p>
<p>Bonus: Here’s an alternate take–a bit faster with an alternate ending.</p>
