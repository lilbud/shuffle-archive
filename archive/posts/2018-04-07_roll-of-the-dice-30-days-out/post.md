And then there’s “30 Days Out.”

It didn’t make the *Human Touch* album it was recorded for, and it never made it into the vault for a *Tracks* release. Instead, it slipped out the door when no one was looking, hitched a ride on the b-side of a “Leap of Faith” promo single, and took off for Austria, The Netherlands, Japan, and Australia–the only countries that ever saw anything resembling an official release for this song.

I’m mystified, because “30 Days Out” is a darn good song, stronger than many of the songs that made it to the album.

Musically, “30 Days Out” suffers from the same overproduction that plagues *Human Touch.* (There’s an album I’d love to see Bruce completely re-record some day.) But it grooves, the lyrics are catchy, and Bruce’s vocals are at his peak, some of his purest on record.

Perhaps the reason Bruce cast this song off is that lyrically, it’s ground well trod for him:

*We fell in love and I made you the world*  
*I spent all my time trying to satisfy you, girl*  
*Just one thing that I can’t figure out*  
*Closer I get, farther baby I am out*

*Thirty days, thirty days out*  
*Well I’m six days running but I’m thirty days out*  
*Thirty days, thirty days out*  
*With every kiss you leave a little shadow of doubt*

*The roof was leaking honey where we live*  
*And I’m wondering what’s that something that you won’t give*  
*I started loving you but I gotta stop*  
*You got me mostly waiting for that other shoe to drop*

*Tried to talk about what’s going on*  
*You just smile and tell me “Baby there ain’t nothing wrong”*  
*In your smile there’s a sign in red*  
*It said “Thousand miles of hard road dead ahead”*

The notion of the mysterious girl he can never quite please–who remains just emotionally out of reach even though she professes otherwise–that’s familiar territory in the vein of “[I’m Goin’ Down](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/06/05/roll-of-the-dice-im-goin-down/),” “[Brilliant Disguise](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/02/06/roll-of-the-dice-brilliant-disguise/)” and “[Secret Garden](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/05/30/roll-of-the-dice-secret-garden/).” Even “[One Step Up](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/08/17/roll-of-the-dice-one-step-up/)” compares in its titular hook and its ain’t-burning furnace vs. the leaky roof in “30 Days Out.”

Perhaps Bruce felt he’d gone to that well a bit too often; regardless, “30 Days Out” deserves rediscovery and airtime in concert. (Bruce has never performed it live.)

Bonus: Here’s an alternate take–a bit faster with an alternate ending.
