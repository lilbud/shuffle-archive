title: I Played the Fool
---

The Stone Pony first opened its doors in early 1974, and The Blackberry Booze Band was its first house band.

Led by Southside Johnny and Steve Van Zandt, the B.B.B. built a following and refined their sound, eventually becoming the band we now know as Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes.

Twenty years later, the legendary Asbury Park club invited their original band back to celebrate their platinum anniversary, and Southside brought along some friends as well: Jon Bon Jovi, Max Weinberg, Patti Scialfa, and Bruce Springsteen were all on hand for the occasion.

The all-star set kicked off with “I Played the Fool,” and although the sound quality is rough, it’s the only recording we have of Bruce performing the song.

“I Played the Fool” was written by Steve Van Zandt, along with most of the songs on Southside’s classic album. Never released as a single, it’s nevertheless a very strong track on an exceptionally strong album, as well as a horn-fueled crowd-pleaser when performed live.

Although the 1994 performance above is the only one in which Bruce’s vocals can be heard, he did in fact play “I Played the Fool” one other time, at a benefit show in 1998. For that performance, however, Bruce’s contribution was strictly on guitar, with Steve and Southside sharing the vocals. Still, it’s a great performance and a much clearer listen–hear for yourself below.
