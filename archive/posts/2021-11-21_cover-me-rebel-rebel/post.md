David Bowie was the original Springsteen cover artist.

In the summer of 1973, mere months after the release of Bruce’s debut album, Bowie recorded [a cover of “Growin’ Up”](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/01/07/cover-me-david-bowie-growin-up/) for his *Pin Ups* album. It didn’t make the final cut, though, and it would remain in Bowie’s vault for another seventeen years.

The following year, he did it again: Bowie recorded[a cover of “It’s Hard to Be a Saint in the City,”](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/01/10/cover-me-david-bowie-its-hard-to-be-a-saint-in-the-city/) and that one also lingered in the vault–this time for fifteen years.

But in between, Bowie recorded what would turn out to be the most-covered track of his own: his 1974 single, “Rebel Rebel,” with a killer riff that carried it to #64 on the Billboard Hot 100. (It fared much better in the U.K., reaching #5.)

So when Bowie passed away in January 2016, just before Bruce embarked on his River Tour with the E Street Band, Bruce paid tribute to his friend and original cover artist by opening his encore set with a searing performance of the oft-covered “Rebel Rebel.”

It proved to be only a one-off, but the band nailed it–a fitting one-time-only tribute to one of rock’s greatest legends by another.
