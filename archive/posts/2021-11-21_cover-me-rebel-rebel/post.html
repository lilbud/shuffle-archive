<p>David Bowie was the original Springsteen cover artist.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1973, mere months after the release of Bruce’s debut album, Bowie recorded <a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/01/07/cover-me-david-bowie-growin-up/">a cover of “Growin’ Up”</a> for his <em>Pin Ups</em> album. It didn’t make the final cut, though, and it would remain in Bowie’s vault for another seventeen years.</p>
<p>The following year, he did it again: Bowie recorded<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/01/10/cover-me-david-bowie-its-hard-to-be-a-saint-in-the-city/"> a cover of “It’s Hard to Be a Saint in the City,”</a> and that one also lingered in the vault–this time for fifteen years.</p>
<p>But in between, Bowie recorded what would turn out to be the most-covered track of his own: his 1974 single, “Rebel Rebel,” with a killer riff that carried it to #64 on the Billboard Hot 100. (It fared much better in the U.K., reaching #5.)</p>

<p>So when Bowie passed away in January 2016, just before Bruce embarked on his River Tour with the E Street Band, Bruce paid tribute to his friend and original cover artist by opening his encore set with a searing performance of the oft-covered “Rebel Rebel.”</p>

<p>It proved to be only a one-off, but the band nailed it–a fitting one-time-only tribute to one of rock’s greatest legends by another.</p>
