(If he only knew what was coming.)</p>\n<p>Fun fact #2: Alejandro Escovedo was Jesse&#8217;s co-writer, so the Bruce connections in this song run deep.</p>\n<p>With a catchy two-chord riff, an awesomely gonzo video, and a theme that Jesse calls &#8220;P.M.A.&#8221; (Positive Mental Attitude), &#8220;Meet Me at the End of the World&#8221; is irresistible.

Keep your eyes on the small group of people hanging out on the side of the stage over the shoulder of James Cruz, Jesse&#8217;s bass player.</p>\n<p>Given the zoom factor, you&#8217;ll need to trust
