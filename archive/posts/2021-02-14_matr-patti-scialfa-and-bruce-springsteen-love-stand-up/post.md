On an episode of *From My Home to Yours* dedicated exclusively to her music, Patti owned up to what her fans realized long ago: her *Rumble Doll* album was entirely a love letter to her husband.

But there are a couple of love notes on her follow-up album, too, and a standout is "Love (Stand Up)."

Although it features a prominent guitar solo and understated keyboards from Bruce, it's Patti's vocals on "Love (Stand Up)" that carry the day.

Patti has always been underrated as both a songwriter and vocalist, but in my opinion, what truly sets her apart is her rare ability to voice both steel and vulnerability at the same time.

There's an arc across her catalog that makes it clear that her shared love with Bruce is continually forged in fire, a give-and-take that sometimes skews more than it should.

"Love (Stand Up)" fits neatly in that narrative, and the beauty of Patti's delivery is that we hear it simultaneously as a romantic ballad, a cry for attention, and a confident "my turn now." It is all of these things at once, united by an unwavering declaration of love.

Patti actually debuted "Love (Stand Up)" in concert years before it debuted on disc. Throughout Bruce's sophomore Asbury Park holiday show stand in 2001, Patti performed it each night, with her husband and the Max Weinberg 7 providing their instrumental support. Here's her debut performance:

Patti's definitive performance of "Love (Stand Up)," however, came during her brief promotional tour for *23rd Street Lullaby*.

At The Hit Factory in New York City on the evening of April 18, 2004, Patti was backed by her studio musicians plus Nils, Soozie, cellist Jane Scaprantoni (who plays on several tracks on *The Rising*), Mark Stewart, and amazing backing vocalists Lisa Fischer and Robin Clark (you know both of their work even if you don't think you do).

Oh, and her husband was there, too.

Start your Valentine's Day with this wonderfully filmed, beautifully performed, but rarely seen version of "Love (Stand Up)."
