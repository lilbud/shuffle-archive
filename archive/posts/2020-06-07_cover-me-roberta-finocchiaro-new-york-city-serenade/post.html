<p>Italian singer-songwriter Roberta Finocchiaro (you might have caught her in her Light of Day appearances) just dropped her new album, <em>Saving Lives with the Rhythm, </em>and it’s terrific.  Check it out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/robertafinocchiaro/featured">here</a> or on your favorite music streaming service.</p>
<p>But this morning, it’s her fantastic cover of “New York City Serenade” that has me grooving.</p>

<p>“New York City Serenade” is a difficult song to cover, which is probably why so few artists have tried. Roberta plays to her strengths by arranging the song for solo electric guitar, and it translates perfectly.</p>
<p>Filmed in her sun-drenched backyard, her performance of “New York City Serenade” is the perfect way to start off a lazy weekend morning.</p>
