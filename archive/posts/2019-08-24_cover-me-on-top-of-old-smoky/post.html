<p>However, the song didn’t become well known beyond the Appalachian region where it originated until Pete Seeger and The Weavers scored a hit with it in 1951.</p>

<p>(Chances are that you’re more familiar with Tom Glazer’s 1963 adaptation, though. To this day, I have an easier time remembering the “spaghetti” lyrics than the original ones.)</p>

<p>And by now, you’re probably thinking that there can’t possibly be a Bruce Springsteen connection. But of course there is, although it’s one of Bruce’s stranger covers.</p>
<p>On October 25, 1980, Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band brought the River Tour to Portland, Oregon. At the time, Portland and the Pacific Northwest were still very much in recovery mode from the devastating eruption of Mount St. Helens just five months earlier. So the band learned a new song for the occasion, hoping (as Bruce nervously remarked), that his local fans had a sense of humor.</p>
<p>Bruce’s arrangement of “On Top of Old Smoky” is classic E Street, but it sounds like I’m not the only one who can’t remember more than one verse. Take a listen:</p>

<p>And that was it for Old Smoky. Neither the mountain nor Bruce’s cover have been heard from ever since.</p>
