Forgive me if I can’t pin down the original recording of today’s cover tune, but try figuring out the earliest recording of the most-published Christmas hymn in North America.

*you*

“Joy to the World” happens to be celebrating its tricentennial this year–it was written by Isaac Watts exactly 300 years ago in 1719. Here’s the oldest recording I could find, from 1926.

Bruce covered it once and only once–at Sting and Trudie Styler’s Rainforest Fund holiday concert in December 2016.

And he wasn’t alone: Bruce was joined by the assembled array of artists–including Sting, Lisa Fischer, Darlene Love, Ronnie Spector, James Taylor, Idina Menzel, Jennifer Nettles, and Vittorio Grigolo–for an all-star Christmas Carol encore.

This is the first time Bruce was known to have performed this perennial seasonal classic… but I suspect that he unofficially covered it long, long before he ever picked up a guitar.

*officially*

Happy Holidays, however you celebrate them, and may the holiday season bring you peace and joy.
