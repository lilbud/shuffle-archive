<p>I’ve featured Lorenzo Bertocchini’s Springsteen covers before, and I’ll almost certainly do so again. The challenge is narrowing the selection: Not only are his renditions both fresh and very well done, Lorenzo also dives deep–<em>very </em>deep–into Bruce’s catalog.</p>
<p>From deep cuts like “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/11/15/roll-of-the-dice-when-youre-alone/">When You’re Alone</a>” to outtakes like <a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/12/09/cover-me-lorenzo-bertocchini-and-elizabeth-lee-be-true/">his wonderful duet with Elizabeth Lee</a> on “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/12/02/roll-of-the-dice-be-true/">Be True</a>” to unreleased gems like “Sugarland,” Lorenzo obviously has an encyclopedic appreciation of Bruce’s body of work.</p>
<p>That knowledge is on dizzying display in Lorenzo’s original song/shaggy dog story, “Hey Bruce,” which caps off his tribute album, <em>Hearts of Stone</em>. I won’t say much about it other than: it’s clever, catchy, and warrants close attention, because at times the in-jokes and easter eggs fly by faster than I can count.</p>
