Bob Dylan had the courage to stand in that fire, and he caught the sound of that explosion. This song remains a beautiful call to arms. The meaning of this song and the echo of that explosion live on in the struggle for social justice in America that continues so fiercely today.”  <em>–Bruce Springsteen, Kennedy Center Honors, December 7, 1997</em></span></p></blockquote>
<p>Bob Dylan recorded “The Times They Are A-Changin'” on October 24, 1963, during the one-year anniversary of the Cuban Missile Crisis and only weeks after the March on Washington and Dr. King’s “I Have a Dream” speech.</p>

<p>Within a month, President Kennedy would be assassinated, auguring a tumultuous year that proved to be an inflection point for both the Civil Rights movement and America’s overseas interventions.</p>
<p>The times, were most definitely a-changing, and Dylan’s song made sure everyone acknowledged it. He performed it live the very next day following Kennedy’s death.</p>
<p>Amazingly, “The Times They Are A-Changin'” was never released as a single in the U.S. It almost certainly would have been a hit if it had been. (It peaked at #9 in the U.K., where it was released in 1965.)</p>
<p>Over the years, it’s become a beloved protest song, with covers by The Byrds, Peter Paul &amp; Mary, Simon and Garfunkel, The Beach Boys, Cher, The Hollies, and Nina Simone just in the first five years following Dylan’s original version. James Taylor and Carly Simon performed at the legendary 1979 <em>No Nukes</em> concerts, and Billy Joel performed it at his famous Soviet shows.</p>
<p>Rarely does a year go by without a notable live or studio cover. Its rank as #59 on <em>Rolling Stone’s</em> 500 Greatest Songs of All Time is well-deserved.</p>
<p>Given Dylan’s influence on Bruce’s music and career, it seemed predestined that Bruce would eventually cover “The Times They Are A-Changin'” in concert. When he finally did, the circumstances couldn’t have been more auspicious.</p>
<p>On December 7, 1997, Bob Dylan was one of the honorees at the annual Kennedy Center Honors ceremony, and the “New Dylan” was one of the artists selected to pay tribute to him that night.</p>
<p>Although he’d never played it live before, Bruce’s song selection was an obvious one. Fresh off his solo acoustic Ghost of Tom Joad Tour, Dylan’s social protest song was very much in keeping with Bruce’s own recent set lists.</p>
<p>Bruce’s arrangement was somber and sincere, and his performance was mesmerizing both live (Dylan seemed particularly moved) and on the professionally captured video.</p>
<p>From the 1997 Kennedy Center Honors, here’s Bruce Springsteen’s only performance to date of Bob Dylan’s “The Times They Are A-Changin’.”</p>
