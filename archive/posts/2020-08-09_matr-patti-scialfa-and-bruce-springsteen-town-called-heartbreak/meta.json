A bit tougher in tone than her earlier material, Patti found a home for it on her third album and released it as the album&#8217;s first single.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Town Called Heartbreak&#8221; isn&#8217;t a title you&#8217;d expect for a love song, and frankly its lyrics don&#8217;t scream romance either.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px\"><em>They say love</em><br />\n<em>A love has its very own light</em><br />\n<em>That can shine through the darkest night</em><br />\n<em>That we&#8217;ve heard of</em><br />\n<em>And that light</em><br />\n<em>That you may want so much</em><br />\n<em>Well maybe you can never touch</em><br />\n<em>Though you may try</em><br />\n<em>Now at night I dream</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;m all alone</em><br />\n<em>Big sledgehammer and a cold dark stone</em><br />\n<em>Man swing the hammer</em><br />\n<em>World begin to shake</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;m just living in a town called Heartbreak&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>And yet in a way, &#8220;Town Called Heartbreak&#8221; very much is a love song. It&#8217;s about the reality of love, rather than the cliche of it. Maybe we can&#8217;t be complete without our partners, but they&#8217;re not all it takes to make us complete.</p>\n<p>We change, we grow, and our marriages and relationships need to evolve as we do. In that sense, &#8220;Town Called Heartbreak&#8221; is almost a companion piece to &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/06/01/roll-of-the-dice-if-i-should-fall-behind/\">If I Should Fall Behind.</a>&#8221; Bruce wrote that one at the beginning of his life with Patti; &#8220;Town Called Heartbreak&#8221; is almost like Patti&#8217;s answer song many years later.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a tag at the end of Patti&#8217;s song that comes directly from the end of Janis Ian&#8217;s &#8220;Society&#8217;s Child,&#8221; and it ends the song on an ominously unsettled note. &#8220;Society&#8217;s Child&#8221; is about an inter-racial relationship that doesn&#8217;t end well.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Janis Ian - Society&#039;s Child\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-QPF-duKQro?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Perhaps Patti&#8217;s inclusion of it&#8211;besides serving as a hat tip to an influence&#8211;is her way of signalling that love on its own isn&#8217;t enough. There are always other forces at play, and to make a relationship work&#8230;</p>\n<p>Well, you gotta work with me, baby.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Bruce plays acoustic guitar on Patti&#8217;s studio track, a contribution he reprised when he featured &#8220;Town Called Heartbreak&#8221; in his early Magic Tour set lists.</p>\n<p>This time, though, Bruce provided vocals, too, turning the song into a duet&#8211;and I&#8217;d argue it works even better that way. (Patti&#8217;s lyrics read like a conversation even in the original version.)</p>\n<p>Fans by and large didn&#8217;t respond to the Scialfa spotlight, however, and within two months Bruce dropped the song. It hasn&#8217;t been heard from since.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s too bad, because the E Street version is gloriously gritty and features some terrific guitar work from Nils and a rare true duet between Patti and Bruce.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen w/Patti Scialfa - Town Called Heartbreak (Hartford, October 2, 2007)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XOusUJJsQzk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;Town Called Heartbreak&#8221; is one of Patti&#8217;s strongest tracks, and her live performances with Bruce were highlights of the early Magic Tour.
