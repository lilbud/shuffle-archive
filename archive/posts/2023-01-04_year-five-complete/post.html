<p>Today marks the end of Year Five of this site’s daily mission to document every song Bruce Springsteen has ever written, recorded, or performed in concert!</p>
<p>Five years of daily publishing feels like a marathon with no end in sight, but when I stop and consider that today <em>also</em> marks the end of Year Fifty of Bruce’s professional career as a major label artist, I think I can take inspiration and keep this going for a while.</p>
<p>Before we start Year Six, however, I want to thank you for reading, commenting, sharing your stories, telling your Bruce friends about this blog, and for just being a part of this ongoing odyssey. Whether this is your first visit or whether you’ve been with me from the beginning, I appreciate you and hope you’ll stick with me in 2023!</p>

<p>As always, special thanks to those of you who have written to me with corrections, additional information, absolutely amazing “I was there” stories (especially my “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/category/where-the-band-was/">Where the Band Was</a>” guest bloggers who gave me welcome writing reprieves from time to time–please drop me a line if you’d like to share your story), personal anecdotes, and alternative interpretations. That’s been my absolute favorite part of these five years, and as a result I feel like I’ve learned as much as I’ve shared.</p>
<p>And my profound thanks to two special people who make me sound much more polished than I otherwise would:</p>
<ul>
<li>Robyn Sherer reads each and every draft (except this one!) and without fail points out my run-on sentences, extraneous words, redundancies, and generally helps me sound way less long-winded than I am in person.</li>
<li>Lori “Eagle Eye” Pierce, my pro bono, ex post facto copy editor, appears in my inbox within minutes of a typo showing up in one of my essays (in other words, most days). She gives me a chance to do a quick clean-up of my articles before most of you read them.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am deeply grateful to Lori and Robyn. I owe them both more thanks than I can adequately express here.</p>
<p>As always, today also marks the completion of my annual refresh project–every <em>Roll of the Dice</em>, <em>Cover Me</em>, <em>Meeting Across the River, Where the Band Was, Spare Parts and Two Faces</em> entry is now refreshed with repaired media links and new cross-site links. (It’s a longer project every year!)</p>
<p>And finally, today marks the end of the year-long <a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/category/kingdom-of-days/">Kingdom of Days</a> series–but if you enjoy those, fear not: the series restarts tomorrow, with new events from 2022, repaired and fresh media, and new information turned up during my research this past year.</p>
<p>A final note: I know my publishing cadence has slowed this year (I used to publish two articles each and every day), and that’s a reflection of my life getting busier and fuller.</p>
<p>Rather than commit to a cadence and have this site become more burden than joy, I’ve decided to just publish as I’m able to find the time, which organically seems to be working out to 2-3 articles a week in addition to the daily <em>Kingdom of Days</em> post. I’ll continue to spotlight <a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/roll-of-the-dice-album-by-album/">original Springsteen songs</a>, <a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/category/cover-me/">covers</a>, or <a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/category/meeting-across-the-river/">team-ups</a> throughout the year, just a bit less frequently than in years past.</p>
<p>According to my tracking spreadsheet, I still have about 150 articles left to write before I bring this project to a close, so we’ve still got a long way to travel together. I hope you stick with me for the rest of the ride!</p>
<p>Thanks again for reading. Onward to Year Six!</p>
