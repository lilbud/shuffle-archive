Whether this is your first visit or whether you&#8217;ve been with me from the beginning, I appreciate you and hope you&#8217;ll stick with me in 2023!</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/thank_you_PNG132.png?resize=424%2C140\" class=\"aligncenter\"></p>\n<p>As always, special thanks to those of you who have written to me with corrections, additional information, absolutely amazing \u201cI was there\u201d stories (especially my \u201c<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/category/where-the-band-was/\">Where the Band Was</a>\u201d guest bloggers who gave me welcome writing reprieves from time to time\u2013please drop me a line if you\u2019d like to share your story), personal anecdotes, and alternative interpretations. That\u2019s been my absolute favorite part of these five years, and as a result I feel like I\u2019ve learned as much as I\u2019ve shared.</p>\n<p>And my profound thanks to two special people who make me sound much more polished than I otherwise would:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Robyn Sherer reads each and every draft (except this one!) and without fail points out my run-on sentences, extraneous words, redundancies, and generally helps me sound way less long-winded than I am in person.</li>\n<li>Lori &#8220;Eagle Eye&#8221; Pierce, my pro bono, ex post facto copy editor, appears in my inbox within minutes of a typo showing up in one of my essays (in other words, most days). She gives me a chance to do a quick clean-up of my articles before most of you read them.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I am deeply grateful to Lori and Robyn. I owe them both more thanks than I can adequately express here.</p>\n<p>As always, today also marks the completion&nbsp;of my annual refresh project\u2013every&nbsp;<em>Roll of the Dice</em>,&nbsp;<em>Cover Me</em>,&nbsp;<em>Meeting Across the River, Where the Band Was, Spare Parts and Two Faces</em> entry is now refreshed with repaired media links and new cross-site links. (It&#8217;s a longer project every year!)</p>\n<p>And finally, today marks the end of the year-long <a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/category/kingdom-of-days/\">Kingdom of Days</a> series\u2013but if you enjoy those, fear not: the series restarts tomorrow, with new events from 2022, repaired and fresh media, and new information turned up during my research this past year.</p>\n<p>A final note: I know my publishing cadence has slowed this year (I used to publish two articles each and every day), and that&#8217;s a reflection of my life getting busier and fuller.</p>\n<p>Rather than commit to a cadence and have this site become more burden than joy, I&#8217;ve decided to just publish as I&#8217;m able to find the time, which organically seems to be working out to 2-3 articles a week in addition to the daily&nbsp;<em>Kingdom of Days</em> post. I\u2019ll continue to spotlight <a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/roll-of-the-dice-album-by-album/\">original Springsteen songs</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/category/cover-me/\">covers</a>, or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/category/meeting-across-the-river/\">team-ups</a> throughout the year, just a bit less frequently than in years past.</p>\n<p>According to my tracking spreadsheet, I still have about 150 articles left to write before I bring this project to a close, so we\u2019ve still got a long way to travel together. I hope you stick with me for the rest of the ride!</p>\n<p>Thanks again for reading.
