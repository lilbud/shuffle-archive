<p>I gotta envy the Australians, because watching this video made my heart leap into my throat.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAYL_oI_bHA">Watch on Youtube: Cover Me (live at Django) - The Album Show (Springsteen "Born In The USA" show)</a></p>
<p>This was six days ago, folks: live music in a packed club. Sigh… someday, that’ll be us too.</p>
<p>In the meantime, though, we can live vicariously thanks to The Album Show, a “live performance concept” that brings classic albums to new life on the stage.</p>
<p>Led by Sydney-based Michael Carpenter, The Album Show shone their spotlight on Bruce Springsteen’s <em>Born in the U.S.A. </em>last week, and they generously filmed and shared highlights from that performance.</p>
<p>All of their selections are great, but I’m particularly fond of their interpretation of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/01/13/roll-of-the-dice-cover-me/">Cover Me,</a>” a song I don’t even like in its original version. The Album Show’s version is smokier and more nocturnal than Bruce’s original, and it’s a perfect fit for the club’s ambience.</p>
<p>Here’s hoping they release the whole show. In the meantime, check out more of their covers of classic albums <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCextdy0IL2N7w3ktIolAzZA/videos?view=0&amp;sort=dd&amp;shelf_id=0">here</a>.</p>
