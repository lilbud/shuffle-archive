Their romance was short, as Eurydice perished shortly after their wedding, thanks to a deadly snake bite.</p>\n<p>Consumed by grief, Orpheus travelled to the underworld determined to win his wife back, which he does by moving Hades with his beautiful music. Hades imposed only one condition: Orpheus had to lead his wife back to the surface world without once looking back to make sure she was still there. In the end, Orpheus couldn&#8217;t maintain his faith, looked back for reassurance, and lost Eurydice forever.</p>\n<p>That last paragraph is largely irrelevant to Bruce&#8217;s story, however. It&#8217;s enough to know that Orpheus and Eurydice represent doomed romance.</p>\n<p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-attachment-id=\"27749\" data-permalink=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/06/07/roll-of-the-dice-upon-this-day-eurydice/uponthisday_lyrics/#main\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/uponthisday_lyrics.jpg?fit=316%2C466&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"316,466\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"uponthisday_lyrics\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/uponthisday_lyrics.jpg?fit=203%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/uponthisday_lyrics.jpg?fit=316%2C466&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-27749\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/uponthisday_lyrics.jpg?resize=758%2C1120&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"758\" height=\"1120\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/uponthisday_lyrics.jpg?resize=203%2C300&amp;ssl=1 203w, https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/uponthisday_lyrics.jpg?w=316&amp;ssl=1 316w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 758px) 100vw, 758px\" /></p>\n<p>In &#8220;Upon This Day (Eurydice),&#8221; Bruce writes in the voice of Orpheus\u2013or at least, in the voice of a florid poet.
