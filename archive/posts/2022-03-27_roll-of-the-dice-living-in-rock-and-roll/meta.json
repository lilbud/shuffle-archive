Daniels joined The Bruce Springsteen Band as a backing vocalist in October 1971, replacing <a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/11/07/roll-of-the-dice-you-dont-leave-me-no-choice/\">Barbara Dinkins</a>, who preferred singing in the church choir rather than a rock and roll band.</p>\n<p>Daniels made her debut on October 29th; she made her final appearance two days later. Not because her talents were insufficient, but because Bruce had finally realized that a nine-member band wasn&#8217;t economically feasible and made the painful decision to pare the band back to its core five-man, prototypical E Street membership.</p>\n<p>Her tenure may have only lasted three days, but one of those gigs was partially captured on tape, which means we&#8217;re able to eavesdrop on the sound of the briefest of Bruce Springsteen Band eras.</p>\n<p>Daniels wasn&#8217;t the only one-time-only element of that recording. One of the songs she sang backup on that night was an early original Springsteen song called &#8220;Living in Rock and Roll,&#8221; performed that night of October 30th in Richmond, and never (as far as we know) again.</p>\n<div id=\"v-UQQAH2zi-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='568' src='https://videopress.com/embed/UQQAH2zi?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>Like many of Bruce&#8217;s Steel Mill and Bruce Springsteen Band era songs, &#8220;Living in Rock and Roll&#8221; is slight of lyrics and heavy on the jam. The recording above is distant and often muddy, but we&#8217;re able to make out enough of his lyrics to recognize that this is a pure pop song&#8211;nothing to analyze here.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Mama, mama, won&#8217;t you come and see</em><br />\n<em>See what the music has done to me</em><br />\n<em>Gone through my fingers, gone down deep into my soul</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;m just another boy trying to live in rock and roll</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Sister, sister come quick</em><br />\n<em>Just the other night, a revelation</em><br />\n<em>Found it last night, soul on the radio</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;m just another boy trying to live in rock and roll</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well if you&#8217;ve got it, baby</em><br />\n<em>Don&#8217;t hide it</em><br />\n<em>You can feel it</em><br />\n<em>You can&#8217;t hide it, you can&#8217;t hide it</em><br />\n<em>???</em></p>\n<p>The lyrics are either bluffed or repeated from this point forward, and I&#8217;m not even sure I&#8217;ve correctly captured what I&#8217;ve printed above. But I&#8217;m confident we&#8217;re close enough to paint &#8220;Living in Rock and Roll&#8221; as a good-time, uptempo crowd-pleaser, with vocalists Daniels and Dee Holmes clearly audible and acknowledged by Bruce just before launching into the song.</p>\n<p>The next day, the band made it back from Richmond to New Jersey for a show at the National Guard Armory in Long Branch, after which Bruce released his backing vocalists to slim down the payroll.</p>\n<p>Within a matter of weeks, Bruce would leave his own band and head west to start a new life in California, never (or so he thought) to return. He did return, of course, and just a few months later events were in motion that would lead to his first record deal and the formation of a new and enduring band.</p>\n<p>But that&#8217;s a story for another day.</p>\n<p><strong>Living in Rock and Roll<br />\nNever recorded</strong><br />\n<strong>Never released</strong><br />\n<strong>First performed:</strong> October 30, 1971 (Richmond, VA)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> October 30, 1971 (Richmond, VA)</p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
