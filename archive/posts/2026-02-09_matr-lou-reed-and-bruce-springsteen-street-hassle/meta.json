By the end of the summer, the band had moved operations back to The Record Plant, where\u00a0<em>Born to Run</em> was recorded.</p>\n<p>Bruce and the band recorded at The Record Plant throughout the autumn and winter of 1977, but they weren&#8217;t the studio&#8217;s only clients at that time: Lou Reed was also in the building, one floor above Bruce, recording his landmark album\u00a0<em>Street Hassle.</em></p>\n<p>The centerpiece of\u00a0<em>Street Hassle</em> was its eleven-minute title track, a dark, gritty and brutal musical monologue of a street painting. The song is composed of three vignettes, and each sounds for all the world like an alternative character&#8217;s take on a Bruce Springsteen song.</p>\n<p>Chapter 1, &#8220;Waltzing Matilda&#8221; (the first three minutes or so) is sung from the point of view of a woman picking up a male prostitute that could easily be Spanish Johnny; Chapter 2, &#8220;Street Hassle,&#8221; features a drug dealer disposing of the body of a woman who drank some seriously unholy blood.</p>\n<p>And then there&#8217;s Chapter Three, &#8220;Slip Away,&#8221; which begins at the 9-minute mark with a forty-second spoken-word guest monologue about love and pain and death that ends with the words:</p>\n<p>&#8220;Tramps like us, we were born to pay.&#8221;</p>\n<p>And that guest-star? He&#8217;s uncredited, but listen below (or skip ahead to the nine-minute mark if you must), and you&#8217;ll surely recognize him.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"758\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4LK9JjW2noo?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></div>\n<p>That&#8217;s right: Bruce&#8217;s first post-lawsuit appearance on vinyl wasn&#8217;t\u00a0<em>Darkness on the Edge of Town</em>, but rather his uncredited spoken-word performance on Lou Reed&#8217;s &#8220;Street Hassle,&#8221; released four months earlier.</p>\n<p>Bruce&#8217;s guest appearance wasn&#8217;t by design but rather by serendipity. Lou had already written the lyrics, including the &#8220;tramps like us&#8221; monologue, but he was apprehensive about delivering it himself. When he discovered that Bruce was recording below him, he introduced himself, discovered they were mutual fans, and asked Bruce if he&#8217;d be interested in recording the part.</p>\n<p>Bruce read the lyrics, agreed, and recorded his contribution in two takes. The rest is uncredited rock and roll history.</p>\n<p><strong>Street</strong> <strong>Hassle<br />\nRecorded:</strong> Autumn 1977<br />\n<strong>Released:\u00a0</strong><em>Street Hassle\u00a0</em>(1978)<br />\n<strong>Never performed</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a9 February 2, 2019</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>Tramps like us, we were born to pay.
