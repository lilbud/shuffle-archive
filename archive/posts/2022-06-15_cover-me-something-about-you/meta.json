Also, if you wanted to know how to write, how to structure successful pop records, you could learn it all from Motown. The sound of the band, the importance of a great singer. Motown was the school where you wanted to go to learn your craft.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bruce&#8217;s list also includes Elvis, The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, and other rock icons&#8211;artists he&#8217;s covered time and again. The Four Tops hold the distinction of being the desert island artists Bruce has covered the least (and hardly at all&#8211;you&#8217;ll have to look well beyond his standard tour performances to find them).</p>\n<p>There was one Four Tops song that almost made the Springsteen concert cut, though: their 1965 hit &#8220;Something About You.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"The Four Tops ....

And while it may not have been Bruce&#8217;s desert island song of choice (that honor belongs to &#8220;Baby, I Need Your Loving&#8221;), it did inspire one of Bruce&#8217;s own singles.</p>\n<p>The riff from &#8220;Something About You&#8221; bears a strong resemblance to &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/08/21/roll-of-the-dice-pink-cadillac/\">Pink Cadillac</a>,&#8221; and when Bruce broke out the latter song during the Born in the U.S.A. Tour, he didn&#8217;t even try to hide his influence.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Pink Cadillac [Philadelphia, August 14, 1985]\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VCmpqCRlVA4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>But it would take a few more years before Bruce would play the original on stage&#8211;and even then only during a rehearsal. One January day at the Expo Theater in Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, Bruce and the E Street Band took a break from practicing their new\u00a0<em>Tunnel of Love</em> material and tackled the Four Tops classic instead.</p>\n<audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-35074-3\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/201-Something-About-You-Baby.mp3?_=3\" /><a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/201-Something-About-You-Baby.mp3\">https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/201-Something-About-You-Baby.mp3</a></audio>\n<p>Bruce&#8217;s arrangement was pretty faithful to the original&#8211;a bit brighter, thanks to the full horn section, but instantly recognizable from the riff, even if his vocals are too distant to be fully made out.</p>\n<p>Springsteen never did get around to performing it on stage, then or ever. But then again, Bruce hasn&#8217;t toured since shortly after revealing his desert island influences, so don&#8217;t count out a Four Tops appearance in his set list in 2023.</p>\n<p><strong>Something
