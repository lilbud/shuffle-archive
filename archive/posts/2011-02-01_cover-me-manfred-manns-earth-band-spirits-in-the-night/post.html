<p>When it comes to Springsteen covers, Manfred Mann’s Earth Band occupies the throne with not one but <em>three</em> successfully charting hits–all of which scored higher than Bruce was able to do by himself.</p>
<p>The band is best known for their lyric-mangling version of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2023/01/01/roll-of-the-dice-blinded-by-the-light/">Blinded by the Light</a>,” which to this day remains Bruce’s only #1 hit song when Mann took it there in early 1977.</p>

<p>Three years later, <a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/06/14/cover-me-manfred-manns-earth-band-for-you/">he took Bruce’s deep cut “For You” to #15</a> via their 1980 album, <em>Chance.</em> (By 1980, they had lots of Springsteen songs to choose from, so it’s interesting that for all three covers, they drew from Bruce’s very first album.)</p>

<p>But Mann actually covered another <a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2023/01/05/album-companion-greetings-from-asbury-park-n-j/"><em>Greetings From Asbury Park, N.J.</em></a> track even earlier–so early, in fact, that Bruce wasn’t even cool yet.</p>
<p>The Earth Band released two different covers of Bruce Springsteen’s “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/03/01/roll-of-the-dice-spirit-in-the-night/">Spirit in the Night</a>” in back-to-back years, with two different vocalists. Both versions charted, which probably would have annoyed the original artist just a tiny bit if he hadn’t already broken through on his own by the time the second one hit.</p>
<p>Their 1975 album <em>Nightingales &amp; Bombers </em>led off with a lengthy, groovy cover of “Spirits in the Night” (the “s” would maddeningly come and go over the years with various edits and re-issues).</p>

<p>“Spirits in the Night” was released as a single in the U.K. a full month before Bruce became a mega-star with the release of <em>Born to Run; </em>a U.S. version followed in  early 1976.</p>
<p>The single was a heavily edited (for length) version of the album track with vocalist Mick Rogers, and despite some early publicity (including the band’s appearance on Dutch television show <em>TopPop</em> below), “Spirits in the Night” performed disappointingly, peaking at #97 on the Billboard Hot 100.</p>

<p>It was probably just a little too soon.</p>
<p>Because while Mann’s version of “Spirit in the Night” was flying under the radar, Bruce was continuing to build his breakout buzz. When the Earth Band scored a mega-hit the following year with “Blinded by the Light,” the band figured maybe they should take another run at their earlier cover.</p>
<p>But rather than re-release their original 1975 recording featuring Rogers (who had left the band shortly after the release of <em>Nightingales &amp; Bombers</em>), they decided to record a completely new overdub with new vocalist Chris Thompson.</p>

<p>This new version was released in 1977 (after “Blinded by the Light” finished its run on the charts), and this time the band took it all the way to #40 on the Billboard Hot 100.</p>
<p>The Earth Band’s early trilogy of high-flying <em>Greetings from Asbury Park</em> covers remains an unequaled feat in Springsteen history.</p>
<p>But while they haven’t added any new Springsteen songs to their studio albums in the four decades since, they did add a fourth one to their live repertoire. For the past two decades, their live sets have often featured a cover of the only song that came close to carrying Bruce to the #1 spot on his own.</p>
<p>But we’ll cover that one in a future book.</p>
