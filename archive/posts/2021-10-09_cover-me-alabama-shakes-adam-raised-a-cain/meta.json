(The episode isn&#8217;t out yet, but if you&#8217;re so inclined you can keep an eye out for it at whichever podcast hub you frequent. Check out their back episodes while you&#8217;re there!)</p>\n<p>In preparation for our chat, co-host Donna Mintz did some blog recon and took me to task for neglecting one of her favorite covers: Alabama Shakes&#8217; performance of &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/07/03/roll-of-the-dice-adam-raised-a-cain/\">Adam Raised a Cain</a>&#8221; from Bruce&#8217;s MusiCares tribute in 2013.</p>\n<p>Now this particular rendition has been on my covers-to-cover list for so long that it was on Row 8 of a four-digit-long roster. It&#8217;s one of my favorites, too&#8211;an absolutely kick-ass performance.</p>\n<p>So why haven&#8217;t I featured it until now? Partly because over the years, I&#8217;ve skewed more toward lesser-known, international, or amateur artists to spotlight performances that might otherwise fly under the radar.</p>\n<p>But to be completely honest, it&#8217;s also because I worried that if I featured this particular performance, I was going to feel compelled to say something blasphemous, something that would spark a barrage of angry comments. But&#8230; I&#8217;ve worked on my self-restraint, and I think I can keep it in check.</p>\n<p>So this is for you, Donna! And for everyone else, if you haven&#8217;t seen this before: buckle up.</p>\n<div id=\"v-vvjOkpSn-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='426' src='https://videopress.com/embed/vvjOkpSn?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>Wow.</p>\n<p>Okay, I was wrong. I can&#8217;t hold back. I have to say it.</p>\n<p>That is the absolute best performance of &#8220;Adam Raised a Cain&#8221; I have ever seen by\u00a0<em>anyone&#8211;</em>original artist included. Brittany Howard <em>owned</em> that song. It&#8217;s like Bruce wrote it with her in mind to sing it.</p>\n<p>And they did it <em>right in front of Bruce and the E Street Band!</em></p>\n<p>Damn, that took guts.
