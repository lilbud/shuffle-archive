**2017:** Patti Scialfa is sick with the flu and cannot perform, throwing a monkey wrench into the *Springsteen on Broadway* storyline and set list. Bruce adapts by changing that part of the show to focus on his kids instead of his wife, and accordingly, "[Long Time Comin'](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/06/19/roll-of-the-dice-long-time-comin/)" makes its first appearance in the show, in the spot where "[Tougher Than the Rest](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/08/08/roll-of-the-dice-tougher-than-the-rest/)" would normally be. Bruce also swaps out "[Brilliant Disguise](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/02/06/roll-of-the-dice-brilliant-disguise/)" for "[The Ghost of Tom Joad](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/10/17/roll-of-the-dice-the-ghost-of-tom-joad/)," giving added weight to the segment on his social values.
