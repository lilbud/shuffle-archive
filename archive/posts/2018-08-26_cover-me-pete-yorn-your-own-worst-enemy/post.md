Ten points to Pete Yorn for choosing one of the best tracks (but least played) from Bruce's *Magic* album: "[Your Own Worst Enemy.](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/05/31/roll-of-the-dice-your-own-worst-enemy/)"

Another 10 points for his beautiful guitar work and deeply felt vocals.

Minus 5 for not understanding the song.

Still a great cover, though.
