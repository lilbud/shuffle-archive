<p>Ten points to Pete Yorn for choosing one of the best tracks (but least played) from Bruce’s <em>Magic </em>album: “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/05/31/roll-of-the-dice-your-own-worst-enemy/">Your Own Worst Enemy.</a>”</p>
<p>Another 10 points for his beautiful guitar work and deeply felt vocals.</p>
<p>Minus 5 for not understanding the song.</p>
<p>Still a great cover, though.</p>
