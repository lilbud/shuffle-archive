Included in the set: Larry Williams’ 1957 hit, “Bony Moronie.”</p>
<p>Bruce can only be seen and heard on guitar in the newly uploaded video below, but since it’s the only known recorded instance of him playing it, I’m sharing and including it here.</p>

<p>It’s a more frenetic performance than the Larry Williams performance; see below for comparison.</p>
