In 1998, it was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. In 2017, the U.S. Library of Congress enshrined it in the National Recording Registry for its cultural, historical, and artistic significance.</p>\n<p>In 1989, The Temptations received their due honor when they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. When the assembled luminaries gathered on stage for the now-customary all-star jam session, everyone wanted to get in on the &#8220;My Girl&#8221; action&#8211;including an unusually reserved Bruce Springsteen, who can be seen supplying rhythm guitar stage right.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Finale performance of &quot;My Girl&quot; featuring the Temptations at the 1989 Induction Ceremony\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eQ6xLX6sFog?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>I suppose one could technically argue that was Bruce&#8217;s first public performance of &#8220;My Girl,&#8221; but it&#8217;s pretty tough to pick out his contribution among the pantheon of rock royalty on stage.</p>\n<p>He&#8217;d played it once before, at a wedding reception a full decade earlier, but that was a private affair rather than a proper concert. And he played it once after, at a crew party during the Rising Tour&#8217;s holiday break. That one was invite-only, too.</p>\n<p>To find anything resembling a true Springsteen public performance of &#8220;My Girl,&#8221; we&#8217;ll have to time travel to 1997 and visit the long-gone Tradewinds in Sea Bright, New Jersey, where Bruce made a surprise appearance with The Wallflowers during a break in the Ghost of Tom Joad Tour.</p>\n<p>Bruce&#8217;s appearance was heavy on classic rock and roll covers, including a few one-time-only performances like &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/02/07/matr-bruce-springsteen-and-the-wallflowers-brand-new-cadillac/\">Brand New Cadillac</a>,&#8221;\u00a0 &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/07/23/matr-the-wallflowers-and-bruce-springsteen-bring-it-on-home-to-me/\">Bring It On Home to Me</a>,&#8221; and &#8220;My Girl.&#8221; In the recording below, Springsteen starts out respectfully reserved (he was a guest, after all), but he soon finds himself unable to deny his inner crooner.\u00a0Listen to the crowd&#8217;s reaction to the return of Bruce&#8217;s &#8220;rock voice&#8221; after two years of acoustic touring.</p>\n<audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-38922-9\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/1997-03-08-My-Girl.mp3?_=9\" /><a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/1997-03-08-My-Girl.mp3\">https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/1997-03-08-My-Girl.mp3</a></audio>\n<p>Bruce is clearly enjoying himself in that recording, so again we wonder: why haven&#8217;t we seen him perform it on the E Street stage?\u00a0Maybe it&#8217;s because the last time he tried cozying up to Patti with it on stage&#8230;
