You might have heard Suzi Quatro’s cover of “Born to Run” before.

But if Youtube’s stats are to be trusted, you might not have heard *this* version before.

Suzi’s four-minute version from her 1999 *Greatest Hits* album is one of the more well-known Springsteen covers out there, and it’s a mighty fine rendition.

But this expanded five-minute version from her 1995 *What Goes Around* album is so much better. Quatro is all in on Bruce’s signature song, singing with 110% commitment in an arrangement in a way that honors both its Spectorian influence and E Street origin and yet still makes it her own.

Quatro even nails a spoken-word bridge, which could have come off as just plain cheesy if her conviction wavered for even an instant.

This is a seriously well done cover.
