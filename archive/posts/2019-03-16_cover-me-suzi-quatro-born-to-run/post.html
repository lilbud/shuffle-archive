<p>You might have heard Suzi Quatro’s cover of “Born to Run” before.</p>
<p>But if Youtube’s stats are to be trusted, you might not have heard <em>this</em> version before.</p>
<p>Suzi’s four-minute version from her 1999 <em>Greatest Hits</em> album is one of the more well-known Springsteen covers out there, and it’s a mighty fine rendition.</p>
<p>But this expanded five-minute version from her 1995 <em>What Goes Around</em> album is so much better. Quatro is all in on Bruce’s signature song, singing with 110% commitment in an arrangement in a way that honors both its Spectorian influence and E Street origin and yet still makes it her own.</p>
<p>Quatro even nails a spoken-word bridge, which could have come off as just plain cheesy if her conviction wavered for even an instant.</p>
<p>This is a seriously well done cover.</p>
