It seemed like a good idea at the time.

I mean, I’d written essays on almost all of the songs on at one point or another over the life of the blog,

*L.A. Garage Sessions ’83*

Sure there were two (“Follow That Dream” and “Sugarland”) I never got around to, but I knew what my “hook” would be for those songs years ago. I could write them pretty quickly.

And yes, I knew that a couple of the songs differed from their earlier bootleg versions. No worries, I could lightly update those essays.

I convinced myself that in a hour or three, I could polish a ragtag group of essays that would otherwise be destined for “miscellaneous” status into a volume written years the release of the album it examines.

*Roll of the Dice**before*

How could I resist that?

Brimming with confidence and cushioned by an almost three-month lead time buffer, I announced this book as Volume 4 in the series, and I started to write.

And that’s when reality set in.

None of my assumptions above were incorrect. It really didn’t take that long to write the new essays, and I actually enjoyed that part. And it was easy enough to update the entries for songs released elsewhere (“My Hometown,” “County Fair,” “Shut Out the Light,” “Johnny Bye Bye”).

And a few of the essays for songs unique to this album (like “The Klansman” or “Little Girl Like You”) required very little if any changes.

But the others… oy.

What I hadn’t considered was the cross-pollination between so many of the track on this album, and the fact that the order in which Bruce wrote them, the order in which he sequenced them on the album, and the order in which I originally wrote about them were three very distinctly different timelines.

I discovered that in some cases, I’d put an earlier song’s backstory buried deep toward the back of the album, or I’d compared two songs only to find out that the newly released version compared more directly to a different album-mate instead.

I quickly became mired in confusion and started swapping paragraphs between essays like body parts in Frankenstein’s monster. And the essays started to reflect it. So I started polishing, scrubbing, deleting, rewriting, to the point where in some cases I lost track of what was original and what was new.

The upshot is that this book contains more new writing than I ever intended, something I’m not likely to repeat in this year’s remaining volumes.
