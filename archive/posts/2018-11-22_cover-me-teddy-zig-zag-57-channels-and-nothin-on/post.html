<p>It’s not often I can say this: I think this cover is better than Bruce’s original version.</p>
<p>Teddy “Zig Zag” Andreadis has toured with and supported artists ranging from Guns N’ Roses to Carole King, but his roots are on the Jersey shore.</p>
<p>Maybe that’s why he takes so well to covering Bruce. He made a gutsy choice, too–opting for “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/05/17/roll-of-the-dice-57-channels-and-nothin-on/">57 Channels (And Nothin’ On)</a>,” a song that was both lyrically and musically dated almost as soon as it was released.</p>
<p>Zig Zag’s take is bluesy and earthy, breathing new life into the song. Well done.</p>
