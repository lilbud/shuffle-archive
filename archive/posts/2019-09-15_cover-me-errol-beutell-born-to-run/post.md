Long time readers know that I have a rule when it comes to covering Bruce: either do it better or do it different–or don't bother.

But there are exceptions to every rule, and one-man cover band Errol Beutell is our case in point today.

Errol's version of "Born to Run" may hew closely–*very* closely–to the original album arrangement, but he brings such passion, joy, prowess, resourcefulness, and chutzpah to his rendition of Bruce's iconic anthem that I can't help but break out in a big, goofy grin every time I watch it.

And I bet you will, too. Check it out:

Errol also gets points for covering a song that really means something to him, as he explains in his vlog that accompanies the song:

I've never met Errol, and I have no idea if he reads this blog, but just in case:

From fan to fan, Errol: Very nice work. Keep the great covers coming, and I hope to run in to you at a show someday!
