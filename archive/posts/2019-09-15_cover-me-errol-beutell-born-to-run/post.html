<p>But there are exceptions to every rule, and one-man cover band Errol Beutell is our case in point today.</p>
<p>Errol’s version of “Born to Run” may hew closely–<em>very</em> closely–to the original  album arrangement, but he brings such passion, joy, prowess, resourcefulness, and chutzpah to his rendition of Bruce’s iconic anthem that I can’t help but break out in a big, goofy grin every time I watch it.</p>
<p>And I bet you will, too. Check it out:</p>

<p>Errol also gets points for covering a song that really means something to him, as he explains in his vlog that accompanies the song:</p>

<p>I’ve never met Errol, and I have no idea if he reads this blog, but just in case:</p>
<p>From fan to fan, Errol: Very nice work. Keep the great covers coming, and I hope to run in to you at a show someday!</p>
