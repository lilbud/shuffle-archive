<p>For every song that escapes, another never even makes it out of the notebook.</p>
<p>Today we take another trip back into young Bruce Springsteen’s songwriting notebook. While today’s entry is undated, lyrically it seems in keeping with Bruce’s post Steel Mill but pre-label days, so let’s peg it to the early 1970s.</p>
<p>The song appears to have multiple titles: at the top of the page is “Daddy Long Legs / Baby Son,” and just below it is “Phantom Love  (Just 16).”</p>
<p>Only the “phantom love” phrase appears in the lyrics themselves, though, so let’s assume that the “daddy long legs/baby son” is an orphan.</p>

<p>“Phantom Love (Just 16)” is a bit tough to analyze, because it seems very much like a work in progress. There are no chord notations to give us a sense of its musicality, but the lack of obvious meter or external rhyme scheme suggests that it was probably a slower song (if a song at all).</p>
<p>Bruce also seems to be having trouble with the first verse, scratching out phrases, overwriting and adding parentheticals to a point that makes it almost impossible to determine what he intended as the final product:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Phantom love I will chase in exile down St. Christopher</em><br/>
<em>Without armor or audience (fancy studs) till your beast lover (lover men) turn child</em><br/>
<em>In search of a softer quieter lie</em><br/>
<em>She moves in a ballerina suit tight and quick</em><br/>
<em>I’m steppin’ in buckle boots slick and sharp</em></p>
<p>What we can make out appears to be the beginning of a would-be romance between lovers from different worlds. The second verse is clearer and more confident, though. The phrase “softer, quieter lie” appears to be a recurring theme, a nice notion for a pair that seem to <em>want </em>to be in love but can’t quite manage to get there.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Chase the little hood down through the fire wood</em><br/>
<em>And we’ll walk together once again in search of that softer quieter lie</em><br/>
<em>And I’ll really believe that I want you</em><br/>
<em>And you’ll really believe you need me</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Did I tell you, Bobby, I got me a phantom love</em></p>
<p>That’s all we get. As far as we know, “Phantom Love (Just 16)” never evolved into anything more; not a single phrase appears elsewhere in Bruce’s catalog.</p>
<p>We’ll chalk this one up to a songwriter’s experiment, one of what must be countless hidden away in the pages of Bruce’s decades of notebooks.</p>
<p><strong>Phantom Love (Just 16)<br/>
Never recorded</strong><br/>
<strong>Never released</strong><br/>
<strong>Never performed</strong></p>
