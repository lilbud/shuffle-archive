Singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist Phil Beer is no stranger to Bruce Springsteen’s catalog, having played covers of Bruce’s music at least as far back as his Albion Band days a couple of decades ago.

Even today, he’s likely to feature songs like “” and “” in his acoustic sets.

His high-water mark, though, is undoubtedly his band’s joyously rollicking cover of “” from his album.

Beer’s version of “No Surrender” leans heavily on Gareth Turner’s melodeon, infusing Bruce’s song with a zydeco spirit that’s impossible to resist.

Introduced as a one-off cover, “No Surrender” immediately became a fan favorite and has remained a consistent encore number ever since.
