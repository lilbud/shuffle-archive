<p>My rule for what makes for a great cover of a Bruce Springsteen song: do it different or do it better.</p>
<p>This one definitely falls in to the former category.</p>
<p>“Thunder Road” has been covered countless times, by artists famous and obscure. But I’m not sure it’s ever been covered like this.</p>
<p>In 2006, the experimental rock band Tortoise got together with singer-songwriter Bonnie “Prince” Billy in the studio, and together they released <em>The Brave and The Bold</em>, an album of covers. Actually, that’s probably not a fair description–let’s call it an album of reinterpretations or reinventions.</p>
<p>Because that’s what their version of “Thunder Road” is. Arranged as a minor-key prog rock mind trip, “Thunder Road” is a completely different song. Take a listen, ideally in the dark:</p>

<p>Amazing, isn’t it?</p>
<p>Bruce’s lyrics–an invitation for freedom and escape–come across here as dark temptation and seduction. I don’t know exactly where Bruce’s “Thunder Road” narrator is heading when he pulls out of that town, but Tortoise and Billy’s narrator doesn’t seem to be heading anyplace that leads to redemption.</p>
<p>It may not be something I’d want to listen to repeatedly, but it’s a seriously well-done cover.</p>
