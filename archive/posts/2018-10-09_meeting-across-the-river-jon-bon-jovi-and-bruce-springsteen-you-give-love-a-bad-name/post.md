On January 31, 1998, Bruce joined Jon Bon Jovi on stage at the Count Basie Theater in Red Bank at a benefit concert for the memorial fund of a slain local police officer.

Together they played a one-time-only rendition of Bon Jovi’s first number one hit, “You Give Love a Bad Name,” with Bruce taking lead vocals on the second verse.
