So perhaps it’s a bit of a deep cut for us to expect it to show up in a Springsteen set list.</p>

<p>Then again, the same could be said of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/08/05/roll-of-the-dice-cover-me-trapped/">Trapped</a>” and “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/07/28/cover-me-many-rivers-to-cross/">Many Rivers to Cross</a>,” both released as singles by Cliff to little notice until Bruce added them to his set lists.</p>
<p>Bruce has long been a huge Jimmy Cliff fan, and over the years he’s performed many of Cliff’s songs, sometimes with the artist himself.</p>
<p>But Bruce has never covered “Sufferin’ in the Land” in concert, despite rehearsing it during warm-up sessions for the Working on a Dream Tour. Luckily for us, that rehearsal was captured and managed to escape into the wild.</p>

<p>Okay, granted that’s neither the E Street Band’s strongest performance nor Bruce’s best vocal (the bluffing gives away the lack of a teleprompter), but in fairness it’s not something they ever expected anyone outside of the room to hear.</p>
<p>Still, that escapee recording allows us to hear what an E Street Band cover might sound like if we’re ever fortunate enough to hear them try it.</p>
