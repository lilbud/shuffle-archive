Okay, this one’s more than a little bit rough. But if you’re like me–a completist that absolutely *must* listen to every song Bruce has written and recorded or performed at least once–well then, please proceed.

We only know of one documented performance of Bruce’s early song, “Good Lovin’ Woman,” and this is it: the last song of a Steel Mill concert from August 14, 1970.

Bruce was only 20 at the time, and we have good reason to believe he’d written the song much earlier (he introduced it as “an old song.” But since records from those days are far from complete (it’s amazing we have any at all), and since we know of no studio recordings, this is all we have to go by.

But it sure *sounds* like something a heterosexual teenage boy would write. I can’t make out most of the lyrics in the first half of the song (the distortion is too loud), but honestly, I’m not sure it matters. Judging from the back half of the song (which is full of high school rock cliches), this isn’t one of Bruce’s deeper compositions.

Ah, but that guitar solo just past the three-minute mark… that’s another story. Bruce had a reputation even then as one of the fastest guitarists on the Jersey Shore, and he reminds us why in this performance. It’s worth listening to just for that.
