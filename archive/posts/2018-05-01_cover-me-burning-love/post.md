It’s always a fun moment when “Burning Love” shows up in the setlist. Arthur Alexander’s 1972 brassy, swinging classic (made famous when Elvis Presley covered it shortly after) is perfectly suited for the super-sized E Street Band of recent years.

Here’s Bruce covering it in Nashville in 2014:

But Bruce doesn’t need the band to rock this tune–here he is taking requests on his acoustic guitar in a Paris pre-show in 2013:

The “hunka hunka’s” are dead giveaways that Bruce has Elvis’ version in mind when he plays the song, but I’m more partial to the original below. If you haven’t heard it before, give it a listen–the arrangement would have been right at home on the Wrecking Ball and High Hopes Tours.
