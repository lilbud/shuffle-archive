If asked to name a defining trait for Bruce Springsteen on\u00a0<em>Family Feud</em>, &#8220;passion&#8221; would almost certainly be the number one answer. But the singer of &#8220;Blood Brothers&#8221; can&#8217;t dredge any of it up&#8211;he can only remember it in the faint, foolish, glow of youth.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>We played king of the mountain out on the end</em><br />\n<em>The world come charging up the hill, and we were women and men</em><br />\n<em>Now there&#8217;s so much that time, time and memory fade away</em><br />\n<em>We got our own roads to ride and chances we got to take</em><br />\n<em>We stood side by side each one fighting for the other</em><br />\n<em>And we said until we died we&#8217;d always be blood brothers</em></p>\n<p>Yes, Bruce is speaking of and to the E Street Band here. He admitted as much in interviews at the time&#8211;in fact he wrote the song on the eve of (temporarily, it turned out) reuniting with them in the studio. And that pull-quote at the top of the essay&#8211;it probably sounded a bit melodramatic at the time, but with the retrospective knowledge that its speaker has struggled all his adult life with depression&#8230;. well, suddenly that abyss seems very real and very close. I&#8217;d argue that &#8220;Blood Brothers&#8221; may be the most depressive song in Bruce&#8217;s catalog, the one that most clearly laid bare (if only we knew how to hear it at the time) his emotional struggle.</p>\n<p>But even if Bruce wrote &#8220;Blood Brothers&#8221; in the grip of a depressive period (and there&#8217;s a very good chance that he did), the thing is: he&#8217;s not wrong. The E Streeters did and do indeed have their own roads to ride and chances to take. There&#8217;s no question that the band members have benefited from their &#8220;me time&#8221; over the years; a balance of personal and fraternal time is vital, and today&#8217;s Bruce seems to have finally realized it.</p>\n<p>But in 1995, he was still searching and still coming to terms with the warring sides of his nature.</p>\n<p>Remember, this is the man who only a few years earlier wrote one of the other defining songs of the Reunion Era:</p>\n<div style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>We said we&#8217;d walk together baby come what may</em><br />\n<em>That come the twilight should we lose our way</em><br />\n<em>If as we&#8217;re walking a hand should slip free</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;ll wait for you</em><br />\n<em>And should I fall behind</em><br />\n<em>Wait for me</em></div>\n<div style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>We swore we&#8217;d travel darlin&#8217; side by side</em><br />\n<em>We&#8217;d help each other stay in stride</em></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Granted, &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/06/01/roll-of-the-dice-if-i-should-fall-behind/\">If I Should Fall Behind</a>&#8221; is a romantic song and &#8220;Blood Brothers&#8221; a fraternal one, but the narrator of the latter seems to have lost the heart of the former.</p>\n<div style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">\n<p><em>Now the hardness of this world slowly grinds your dreams away<br />\n</em><em>Making a fool&#8217;s joke out of the promises we make<br />\n</em><em>And what once seemed black and white turns to so many shades of gray<br />\n</em><em>We lose ourselves in work to do, work to do and bills to pay</em></p>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If there&#8217;s an emotional core to &#8220;Blood Brothers,&#8221; this is it: that the passion and promise of youth inevitably comes under siege by the pressures of age.</p>\n<p>Until this point, Bruce had largely lived a Peter Pan life, but now in 1995 he had three small children, had squarely entered middle age, and seemed to have left his rock and roll glory days behind him.</p>\n<p>In other words&#8211;and in later words&#8211;it was &#8220;bills and kids and kids and bills and the ringing of the bell.&#8221;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>And it&#8217;s a ride, ride, ride, and there ain&#8217;t much cover</em><br />\n<em>With no one running by your side, my blood brother</em></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s worth pausing for a moment here to note that despite the obviously personal lyrics and the interviews where Bruce flat-out copped to writing the song about the band, the song itself is actually sung to only one person, one blood brother. It would be a few years before Bruce would alter it to remove the veil&#8211;but we&#8217;re getting ahead of ourselves.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s the final verse that reveals the emotional state of the singer. He&#8217;s numb, detached, and removed from his actions, unable to feel the connections he&#8217;s clearly subconsciously searching for.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>On through the houses of the dead past those fallen in their tracks</em><br />\n<em>Always moving ahead and never looking back</em><br />\n<em>Now I don&#8217;t know how I feel, I don&#8217;t know how I feel tonight</em><br />\n<em>If I&#8217;ve fallen &#8216;neath the wheel, if I&#8217;ve lost or I gained sight</em><br />\n<em>I don&#8217;t even know why, I don&#8217;t know why I made this call</em><br />\n<em>Or if any of this matters anymore after all</em></p>\n<p>The song&#8217;s final couplet almost seems like an afterthought, a too-neat bow to end the song on a happy note the song hasn&#8217;t earned.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>But the stars are burning bright like some mystery uncovered</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;ll keep moving through the dark with you in my heart, my blood brother</em></p>\n<p>But the key is in that very last line, now that we know to look for it: at the time at least, Bruce was still in the dark, still moving through it, and he knew that his personal relationships were the key to making it through to the other side.\u00a0He&#8217;s not in a healthy place, but he knows his best chance of getting there lies with his family and friends.</p>\n<p>That apathy carried through more than just the lyrics; during his professionally documented recording sessions with the E Street Band, Bruce couldn&#8217;t seem to find an arrangement that fit the song. Or maybe he was simply searching for an arrangement that would jolt him into feeling what he sang about losing.</p>\n<p>In any event, besides the &#8220;official&#8221; version above that appears on\u00a0<em>Greatest Hits,\u00a0</em>we also have this &#8220;rock&#8221; version (with abbreviated lyrics) from the <em>Blood Brothers\u00a0</em>EP.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Blood Brothers (Alternate Version)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LrzSY2bVDzg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Interestingly, the rock version discards the &#8220;I don&#8217;t know why&#8221; ending of the official version and replaces it with this couplet:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Now the moon&#8217;s dirty light shines &#8216;cross the highway unfurled</em><br />\n<em>And this love burns inside me like the last light in the world</em></p>\n<p>Those lines don&#8217;t appear in any other of the versions floating around, so it may have been a fleeting attempt by Bruce to summon a sentiment he just wasn&#8217;t feeling.
