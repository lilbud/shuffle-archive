Or maybe ever.</p>\n<p>What the uninitiated didn&#8217;t know, of course, is what we know: Bruce was exaggerating a bit. Or maybe more than a bit.</p>\n<p>Bruce in fact\u00a0<em>had</em> played &#8220;You Never Can Tell&#8221; with his band before, and he was 24, not sixteen. Here&#8217;s their first performance, from The Agora in Cleveland in the spring of 1974:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - YOU NEVER CAN TELL  1974 (audio)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Clmk7R1mlTI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Now perhaps we can cut Bruce some slack here&#8211;that was almost four decades prior to that Leipzig performance, after all. Plus, that was a very different E Street Band&#8211;it didn&#8217;t even include Roy or Max yet (or Steve, for that matter).</p>\n<p>Except that Bruce played it with Max and Roy (with Max&#8217;s band Killer Joe) fifteen years later (almost to the day) at The Stone Pony in Asbury Park.</p>\n<div id=\"v-tWJczTmo-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='426' src='https://videopress.com/embed/tWJczTmo?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>But of course that wasn&#8217;t an E Street Band show at all, so we can excuse that one too.</p>\n<p>Except that Bruce played it\u00a0<em>again</em>, this time with the modern E Street Band in 2009&#8211;<em>twice</em>&#8211;just four years before the Leipzig show, once in Spain and once in the &#8216;burbs of Boston. And they had just as awkward a start in Mansfield as they did in Leipzig:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen  &quot;You Never Can Tell&quot;  Mansfield  8-23-09\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gaa_S7-ob1k?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>So why the on-stage memory lapse in Leipzig for a song he&#8217;d played six times before, including twice on the previous tour? Beats me, but it certainly made for a great, fun moment.</p>\n<p>Bruce and the E Street Band tackled &#8220;You Never Can Tell&#8221; only once more since, in Denmark towards the end of their most recent tour&#8211;and they\u00a0<em>still</em> had to take a minute to work out how to play it.\u00a0 But at least he recognized the pattern.
