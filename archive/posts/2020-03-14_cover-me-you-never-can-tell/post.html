<p>On July 7, 2013 in Leipzig, Germany, Bruce took a sign request early in the show for “You Never Can Tell,” Chuck Berry’s final Top 40 hit of the 1960s.</p>

<p>“Every night we try to pull one out that we haven’t played since we were…. I don’t know, sixteen,” Bruce said by way of introduction. “If maybe ever. So let’s see how we do with this.”</p>
<p>Then followed two charmingly awkward minutes of the E Street Band trying to figure out how to play the song before launching into a completely and masterfully improvised performance that showed off both the band’s versatility and Bruce’s skill as a bandleader.</p>

<p>Longtime fans weren’t surprised, of course–we’d seen them do this countless times before. But something about this performance–so loose and yet so simultaneously tight–attracted worldwide attention like never before.</p>
<p>The clip above went viral–to date it’s had more than 40 million views. (By comparison, the official video for “Born to Run” is just a notch higher at 42 million.) The story was picked up by newspapers and web sites worldwide.</p>

<p>All over the world, it seemed, on-line audiences couldn’t help but be impressed and amazed by how quickly and deftly Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band picked up a song they hadn’t played since they were, I don’t know, sixteen. Or maybe ever.</p>
<p>What the uninitiated didn’t know, of course, is what we know: Bruce was exaggerating a bit. Or maybe more than a bit.</p>
<p>Bruce in fact <em>had</em> played “You Never Can Tell” with his band before, and he was 24, not sixteen. Here’s their first performance, from The Agora in Cleveland in the spring of 1974:</p>
<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="426" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clmk7R1mlTI" title="Bruce Springsteen - YOU NEVER CAN TELL  1974 (audio)" width="758"></iframe></div>
<p>Now perhaps we can cut Bruce some slack here–that was almost four decades prior to that Leipzig performance, after all. Plus, that was a very different E Street Band–it didn’t even include Roy or Max yet (or Steve, for that matter).</p>
<p>Except that Bruce played it with Max and Roy (with Max’s band Killer Joe) fifteen years later (almost to the day) at The Stone Pony in Asbury Park.</p>
<div class="video-player" id="v-tWJczTmo-1"><iframe allow="clipboard-write" allowfullscreen="" aria-label="VideoPress Video Player" data-resize-to-parent="true" frameborder="0" height="426" src="https://videopress.com/embed/tWJczTmo" title="VideoPress Video Player" width="758"></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost="ignore" src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js"></script></div>
<p>But of course that wasn’t an E Street Band show at all, so we can excuse that one too.</p>
<p>Except that Bruce played it <em>again</em>, this time with the modern E Street Band in 2009–<em>twice</em>–just four years before the Leipzig show, once in Spain and once in the ‘burbs of Boston. And they had just as awkward a start in Mansfield as they did in Leipzig:</p>
<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="426" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gaa_S7-ob1k" title='Bruce Springsteen  "You Never Can Tell"  Mansfield  8-23-09' width="758"></iframe></div>
<p>So why the on-stage memory lapse in Leipzig for a song he’d played six times before, including twice on the previous tour? Beats me, but it certainly made for a great, fun moment.</p>
<p>Bruce and the E Street Band tackled “You Never Can Tell” only once more since, in Denmark towards the end of their most recent tour–and they <em>still</em> had to take a minute to work out how to play it.  But at least he recognized the pattern. (“We go through this every time we cover this song.”)</p>

<p>This time, though, no one took notice but the Horsens fans.</p>
<p>It just goes to show: when it comes to predicting whether a great performance will go viral… well, you never can tell.</p>
