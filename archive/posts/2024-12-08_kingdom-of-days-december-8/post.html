<p><strong>1950: </strong>Bruce’s younger sister Ginny is born in Freehold, New Jersey. Decades later, she will inspire Bruce’s timeless classic, “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/03/04/roll-of-the-dice-the-river/">The River</a>.”</p>
<p><strong>1972: </strong>Peter Knobler interviews Bruce for <em>Crawdaddy</em> at Bruce’s girlfriend’s house in Bradley Beach. That night, Bruce and the as-yet-unnamed E Street Band play their fourth night of a six-night, two-shows-nightly stand at Kenny’s Castaways in New York City.</p>

<p><strong>1980: </strong>Bruce and the boys play their second of three River Tour nights at the Philadelphia Spectrum. Earlier that Day, John Lennon gave an interview praising “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/12/21/roll-of-the-dice-hungry-heart/">Hungry Heart</a>” as his current favorite song. It would prove to be his last favorite song: while Bruce is on stage performing tonight, John Lennon is murdered in New York City.</p>
