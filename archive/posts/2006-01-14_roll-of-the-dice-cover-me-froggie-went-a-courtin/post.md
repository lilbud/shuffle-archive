True fact: Bruce’s first solo on *We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions* comes ninety seconds before the end of the album, when he finally allows himself a moment in the instrumental spotlight with his harmonica.

“Froggie Went A-Courtin'” is the song that finally broke through Bruce’s atypical reticence–a joyous celebration of a track and a merry way to close his 2006 Americana album.

Except “Froggie Went A-Courtin'” isn’t really Americana–it predates America by over a century, dating back to Scotland in the mid-sixteenth century and possibly earlier.

There’s been much debate over the folk song’s subtext, much of it speculating that it serves as commentary on the court of Queen Elizabeth I. But that’s not a settled matter, and such debates are beyond the scope of this blog.

In any event, it seems clear that Bruce cared little for the political context of “Froggie Went A-Courtin” when he recorded it. It’s a familiar song (thanks to memorable recordings by Pete Seeger, Woody Guthrie, Burl Ives, Bob Dylan, and a host of others), a fun ensemble piece, and an upbeat way to close the album.

There have been so many versions of “Froggie Went A-Courtin'” over the years, in fact, that over 170 verses have been collected and catalogued.

Bruce seems to have taken his cue from Pete Seeger’s version (no surprise, given the inspiration for the project); although Bruce omits several of Seeger’s verses, Pete’s seems to be the first recording to include the final “cornbread” verse that also appears in Bruce’s version.

How much fun is “Froggie Went A-Courtin’?”

So much that Elvis Presley had a blast goofing to it at an improv studio rehearsal session.

And so much fun that Bruce couldn’t resist singing along with himself when he heard the playback.

So why didn’t Bruce play it more often during the Seeger Sessions Tour? That I don’t know.

He did play it a half-dozen times in 2006, though, and one of those (in Santander, Spain) was captured on distant video. It’s not the best quality, but it’s infectious enough to get your toes tapping.
