Later that night–so late that it’s technically the following day, August 31–Bruce makes a surprise appearance at The Agora in Cleveland. Even though they’ve already turned in a full show, Bruce, Steve, Clarence, Roy, and Garry join Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes on-stage for absolutely fantastic performances of “[The Fever](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/10/04/roll-of-the-dice-the-fever/),” “[I Don’t Want to Go Home,](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/03/30/meeting-across-the-river-bruce-springsteen-and-steve-van-zandt-i-dont-want-to-go-home/)” “[Having a Party](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/12/31/matr-bruce-springsteen-and-southside-johnny-having-a-party/),” and “Stagger Lee.” Must-watch pro-shot video below, featuring the definitive version of “The Fever” — it may never be topped.

**2008:** An epilogue for the Magic Tour: Bruce and the E Street Band headline the Harley Davidson 105th Anniversary Festival at The Roadhouse at The Lakefront in Milwaukee. “[Gypsy Biker](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/05/02/roll-of-the-dice-gypsy-biker/)” is a fitting opener, and “[Born to Be Wild](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/05/20/cover-me-born-to-be-wild/)” bookends it as the final encore. “[Wooly Bully](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/03/31/cover-me-woolly-bully/)” is a mid-set tour premiere (its first appearance in 23 years), and Danny Federici’s son Jason plays his dad’s part on “[4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/04/26/roll-of-the-dice-4th-of-july-asbury-park-sandy/).”

**2016:** Jaws drop and the Internet breaks: Bruce and the E Street Band break their U.S. record–again–for the longest show ever (this time breaking the four-hour mark), but it’s the set list at this final East Rutherford show that blows minds: the show starts with the by now (amazingly) standard opener, “New York City Serenade” complete with strings, but what follows is a largely chronological trip through Bruce’s catalog. Rickie Lee Jones guest stars on three songs, and Bruce plays the entire second side of *The Wild, The Innocent, and The E Street Shuffle* (including the tour premiere of “[Kitty’s Back](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/01/22/roll-of-the-dice-kittys-back/)“). Also making their tour premiere: “[Pretty Flamingo,](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/12/04/cover-me-pretty-flamingo/)” “[Living Proof](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/03/18/roll-of-the-dice-living-proof/),” and “[Secret Garden](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/05/30/roll-of-the-dice-secret-garden/).” A fireworks-accompanied “[Jersey Girl](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/07/24/cover-me-roll-of-the-dice-jersey-girl/)” closes a remarkable show.
