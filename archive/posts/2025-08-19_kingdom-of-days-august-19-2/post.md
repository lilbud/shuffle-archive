**2008:** The Magic Tour’s victory lap includes a show at Hersheypark Stadium, where Bruce brings back two Tunnel of Love tour staples, both played for the first time in 20 years: “[Boom Boom](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/03/26/cover-me-boom-boom/)” and “[Part Man, Part Monkey](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/02/19/roll-of-the-dice-part-man-part-monkey/).” The show closes with another tour premiere: “[Gloria](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/03/16/cover-me-gloria/),” featuring Joe and Johnny Grushecky (although somehow, the local paper misidentifies Joe for Tommy James).
