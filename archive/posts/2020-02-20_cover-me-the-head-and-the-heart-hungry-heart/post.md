Who knew The Head and The Heart are Springsteen fans?

I didn't, at least not until the band showed up for the premiere of *Blinded by the Light* at Sundance and performed a Springsteen tribute in Park City the night before.

But fear not, THATH/Springsteen fans: late last year, The Head and The Heart paid homage to Bruce once again, and this time their performance was not only captured on audio–it was streamed as part of a special 70th birthday tribute show.

Here's that performance: a lovely and aptly-chosen cover of Bruce's "[Hungry Heart](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/12/21/roll-of-the-dice-hungry-heart/)."
