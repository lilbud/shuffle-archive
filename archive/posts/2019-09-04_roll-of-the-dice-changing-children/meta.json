But when you listen to the lyrics, what seems at first like a contemporary protest song soon reveals itself to be anything but.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well everybody&#8217;s saying their favorite sayings</em><br />\n<em>Everybody&#8217;s singing their favorite songs</em><br />\n<em>Everybody&#8217;s got a favorite game they&#8217;re playing</em><br />\n<em>We&#8217;re alright, but I guess we&#8217;re all wrong</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I said you better take a look around you brother</em><br />\n<em>Something&#8217;s happening here</em><br />\n<em>Sooner or later it&#8217;s gonna surround you</em><br />\n<em>And leave you with nothing but fear</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>All you gotta do is hang around</em><br />\n<em>Tell you you&#8217;re never gonna know</em><br />\n<em>Just what&#8217;s going down</em></p>\n<p>Go back and listen to (or simply read) that second verse again&#8211;it&#8217;s a direct reference to Buffalo Springfield&#8217;s already-classic protest song &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/02/13/cover-me-for-what-its-worth/\">For What It&#8217;s Worth</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Buffalo Springfield - For What It&#039;s Worth 1967\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gp5JCrSXkJY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Not only does Bruce quote the song directly in the first couplet, he co-opts the song&#8217;s rhymes for the chorus that follows as well (around/down vs. sound/down).</p>\n<p>If &#8220;For What It&#8217;s Worth&#8221; is a clarion call to action, however, &#8220;Change It&#8221; is a big fat &#8220;why bother?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Although the band&#8217;s vocalists put everything they have into the song&#8217;s &#8220;Change it, children&#8221; refrain (I&#8217;m positive it&#8217;s not &#8220;changing children,&#8221; although I can understand how some might hear that), the song progress from subtle to shockingly over cynicism as with each verse.</p>\n<p>(If you&#8217;re listening to the live recording above, I should point out that Bruce&#8217;s entire &#8220;Well, I know that we all wanna change it, but first we gotta re-arrange it&#8221; verse is an ad lib. I assume that there were some tall folks hogging whatever served as a pit/front-of-stage, and Bruce is gently chiding them to let others see.)</p>\n<p>The song continues, poking and prodding at &#8220;activists&#8221; who are all talk and no action. It&#8217;s not that Bruce didn&#8217;t believe the protest songs (he written several of them himself by this time)&#8211;he was just dismayed that fans would embrace them, sing them, but not live them.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well there&#8217;s cannons on my left, I got cannons on my right</em><br />\n<em>Rode my people out of battle &#8217;till the sign was right</em><br />\n<em>And you know the only path that&#8217;s bringing &#8217;em low now, can&#8217;t you see the light</em><br />\n<em>Oh doing what you want to, living life like you like</em></p>\n<p>At this point, the song tempo awkwardly changes (prompting Bruce to give the audience clapping lessons), abandoning the tropes of classic sixties protest songs and embracing earlier happy-go-lucky rock classics to add an extra note of sarcasm to the lyrics:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Yeah it&#8217;s that time again</em><br />\n<em>I ain&#8217;t felt like this since I don&#8217;t know when</em><br />\n<em>A new sun is rising and the weather is changing</em><br />\n<em>Whoa whoa it&#8217;s revolution</em><br />\n<em>Whoa whoa it&#8217;s revolution</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>So lets get together and have a good time</em><br />\n<em>There&#8217;s so much fun it&#8217;s gonna blow your mind</em><br />\n<em>Break out the guns and the ammo</em><br />\n<em>Everything&#8217;s gonna be fine</em></p>\n<p>(We can clearly hear the influence of The Isley Brothers&#8217; &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/09/12/cover-me-shout/\">Shout</a>&#8221; in the &#8220;it&#8217;s that time again, for revolution&#8221; chorus at around the 5:20 mark above.)</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"The Isley Brothers - Shout\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nEjLFpU2pJ4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>That middle section culminates with probably the least likely lyrics we&#8217;d ever expect to hear from Bruce:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>So take LSD and off the pigs</em><br />\n<em>The summer is over gonna make it big</em></p>\n<p>At this point, Steel Mill slows the song to a crawl, and Bruce&#8217;s vocals become plaintive and <em>almost</em> sincere:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Everybody&#8217;s got a favourite game that they&#8217;re playing</em><br />\n<em>Everybody&#8217;s right Lord, and huh we&#8217;re all wrong</em><br />\n<em>Oh but we can fix that up</em><br />\n<em>We can amend that mistake</em><br />\n<em>Well you know I made a lot of mistakes in my life</em><br />\n<em>Stepped on a few toes too</em><br />\n<em>Well I made a lot of mistakes in my life</em><br />\n<em>The Lord god up above knows that&#8217;s true</em><br />\n<em>Changing, we got to change ourselves oh yeah</em><br />\n<em>From all the destruction</em><br />\n<em>From all the corruption</em></p>\n<p>But only almost.
