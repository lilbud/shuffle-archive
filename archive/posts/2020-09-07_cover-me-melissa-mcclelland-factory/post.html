<p>If her name sounds vaguely familiar and her voice sounds <em>very</em> familiar, that’s probably because she frequently accompanies Sarah McLachlan on tour, playing the bass guitar and providing powerful backing vocals. If you’ve seen Sarah before, you’ve likely seen Melissa.</p>
<p>Melissa’s solo albums are well worth seeking out, particularly her 2004 sophomore album, <em>Stranded in Suburbia. </em>Right at the heart of an album of beautiful original material is a lone cover: Bruce Springsteen’s “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/10/31/roll-of-the-dice-factory/">Factory</a>.”</p>

<p>Arranged as a crunchy “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/03/30/roll-of-the-dice-death-to-my-hometown/">Death to My Hometown</a>“-esque work stomp, Melissa pulls off a tough feat–capturing the song’s original tone while hardening it into a true rocker.</p>
<p>Enjoy the day off if you have it, and send thanks to those who don’t. Our essential workers are what today’s all about.</p>
