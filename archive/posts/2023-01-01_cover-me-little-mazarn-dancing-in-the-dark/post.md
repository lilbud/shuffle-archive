meta-description: Little Mazarn’s brand-new cover of Bruce’s biggest hit is one of my favorite “Dancing in the Dark” covers yet. Take a listen inside.

I’m not sure how to describe Little Mazarn’s sound; “new age/Appalachian” may be as close as I can get.

It’s not worth getting hung up on categories, though, because no matter where you assign it, Little Mazarn’s cover of Bruce’s “” is gorgeous, haunting, and unique. It’ll stick with you long after the first listen.

You can find her version on her new 2019 album, , released mere weeks ago (as I write this, anyway).

Bonus: here’s a live performance from a few months before the album’s release. It’s not quite as stunning as the album version, but the context perfectly captures the isolation and loneliness in Bruce’s lyrics.
