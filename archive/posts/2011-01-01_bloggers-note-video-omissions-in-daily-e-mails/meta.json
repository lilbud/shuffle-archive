(I have notoriously poor sarcasm radar.) But whether she did or not, that was my Mayor Goldie Wilson moment.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Back to the Future - Mayor\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6rvVPqdl2iw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>A blogger&#8230;</em> I thought.\u00a0<em>I like the sound of that!</em></p>\n<p>Now if you know me at all in real life, you know that ideas like this fly through my head on a fairly regular basis. And by\u00a0<em>through</em> I mean: into and then out of. I have enough self-awareness to know that any seemingly great idea that holds my enthusiasm captive today is 99% likely to be forgotten within a day or two.</p>\n<p>But every once in a while&#8230; it sticks.</p>\n<p>Starting a blog was one of the ones that stuck. Starting this book series is another. (I hope, anyway. We&#8217;ll see.)</p>\n<p>E Street Shuffle launched on January 5, 2018. The name stems from the gimmick I came up with to keep the blog fresh and unpredictable to both writer and reader (should I be so lucky to have any): a randomized editorial calendar of daily posts, working my way through the one-thousand-plus songs Bruce Springsteen had written, covered, recorded, gifted, or contributed to over the course of his entire career.</p>\n<p>It was audacious mission, and for a long time I believed I would complete it. For the first three years, I published two posts each and every day, one of which was almost always an examination of one of a Springsteen original or cover. I don&#8217;t think I took even a single day off until my dad died in the summer of 2021.</p>\n<p>I eventually slowed down. I wrote most days in Year 4, many days in Year 5, and a few in Year 6. And then I ran out of gas entirely. The reasons why would fill a very different kind of book.</p>\n<p>But when I recently and serendipitously discovered a publishing partner who shared my vision for what a true blog-based book should both look and feel like, that engine was suddenly refueled.</p>\n<p>And within a matter of days&#8230; here we are.</p>\n<p>Volume One of <em>The E Street Shuffle Bookshelf Collection</em>.</p>\n<p>From the very beginning, the blog featured several sub-blogs, but all of them were sort of in service to what I considered the flagship: <em>Roll of the Dice,\u00a0</em>an exhaustive and comprehensive series of essays delving into every original Springsteen song.</p>\n<p><em>Kingdom of Days</em> was originally intended just as an organizational tool for my linked media, and to maybe serve as a little clickbait to attract readers so they might discover what I considered the more serious work.</p>\n<p><em>Cover Me</em> was originally intended to fill space between\u00a0<em>Roll of the Dice\u00a0</em>entries in the days when I believed (because I was authoritatively told by other bloggers) that it was important to &#8220;feed the beast&#8221; daily. Ironically, <em>Cover Me</em> evolved over time into the series I enjoyed writing the most, for reasons I&#8217;ll explain in the introduction to Volume One of that book.</p>\n<p>But\u00a0<em>Roll of the Dice\u00a0</em>was and is the series I&#8217;m most proud of.</p>\n<p>There have been lots of &#8220;all the songs&#8221; books. I think I probably own them all, and each has their own virtues. I needed to figure out mine.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m neither a professional nor an insider, so I knew I wasn&#8217;t going to have access to Bruce to pick his brain. I&#8217;m neither a professional musician or engineer, so I knew I wasn&#8217;t going to be able to discuss the more technical aspects of Bruce&#8217;s work.</p>\n<p>But I knew I had at least one lane in which I could confidently drive. Because I&#8217;m a historian, and there are certain things that go along with being a historian.</p>\n<p>For one, historians know that human sources&#8211;even primary ones&#8211;are inherently unreliable. I knew even as I started the blog that Bruce Springsteen is an unreliable narrator. By that I don&#8217;t mean to say he&#8217;s dishonest&#8211;far from it. It&#8217;s just that his explanations tend to change, evolve and even contradict themselves over time, he has a tendency to conflate and confuse disparate events and times, and sometimes he just plain forgets stuff.</p>\n<p>In other words, he&#8217;s human. I do the same things if you ask me about my life and work. It&#8217;s how our brains work.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d consumed just about everything ever written about Bruce that I could get my hands on, as well as dozens and dozens of interviews, and it was clear to me that the meaning of Bruce&#8217;s songs had evolved even in his own mind over time.</p>\n<p>Historians also know the importance of deep research. Deep, but also broad. I knew that to trace the origins of the work, I&#8217;d need to travel back in time and listen to his earliest words. I&#8217;d also need to compare his contemporaneous writing. Explore what was happening in the news while he was writing a particular song.\u00a0 Even listen to what was on the radio at the time. (Is it a coincidence that Bruce had David Sancious play a prominent clavinet on &#8220;The E Street Shuffle&#8221; shortly after Stevie Wonder&#8217;s clavinet propelled &#8220;Superstition&#8221; to Number One on the Billboard Top 40? I don&#8217;t think so.) And movies&#8211;it&#8217;s difficult to impart just how important classic and contemporary films are when tracing the the origins of and influences on Bruce&#8217;s music.</p>\n<p>In preparation for writing the blog (although I didn&#8217;t know it at the time), I&#8217;d listened to almost every extant bootleg chronologically, including all of Bruce&#8217;s pre-label outtakes, rehearsals and early band performances. I&#8217;d identified key phrases, lyrical and musical themes that would often resurface&#8211;sometimes verbatim&#8211;years later. I was able to &#8220;see&#8221; connections between songs that I hadn&#8217;t seen anyone write about yet, at least in part because no one was giving the castoffs and outtakes enough attention. I wanted to change that.</p>\n<p>I can&#8217;t say my takes on Bruce&#8217;s songs are more accurate than anyone else&#8217;s. But I am confident that they are deeply considered and informed, with even &#8220;minor&#8221; tracks and castoffs given the same attention, research, and analysis as &#8220;epics.&#8221; I think perhaps that more than anything else sets the essays in this volume apart from similar volumes that tend to focus on officially released or even just &#8220;major&#8221; tracks.</p>\n<p>This first\u00a0<em>Roll of the Dice\u00a0</em>volume features some of my personal favorite essays. I remember gaining a deeper appreciation for &#8220;Mary Queen of Arkansas&#8221; through the process of writing about it; the light bulb above my head when I placed the writing of &#8220;For You&#8221; against the backdrop of a toxic breakup shortly before; the literary rabbit hole I plunged into writing &#8220;Spirit in the Night.&#8221; I can&#8217;t always look back over a collection of my own writing without a least a couple of cringes, but I can with this group.</p>\n<p>That wouldn&#8217;t be the case without the contributions of two very important behind-the-scenes contributors.</p>\n<p>Almost since the very beginning of the blog, Lori Pierce has graced my inbox within an hour of the publication of any new essay, her eagle eye catching each and every typo&#8211;and there are <em>always</em> typos&#8211;so that I could quickly correct them before most of you noticed. I am sure that as soon as she receives her copy of this book, I will learn what typos infest this introduction.</p>\n<p>Starting in Year Four onward, Robyn Sherer started reviewing my drafts before I published them. She become my substantive editor and excelled at pointing out where the dots on the page didn&#8217;t connect nearly as well as they did in my brain. She flagged where sentences were run-on or unclear, and she called me out when my choice of words was overly sesquipedalian.</p>\n<p>Both Lori and Robyn have my continued and renewed gratitude. They&#8217;ve ensured these essays are much more polished than they otherwise would be.</p>\n<p>Although I&#8217;ve wanted to compile these essays in print for several years, I waited until I found a publishing platform that could recreate the interactive, multi-media blog experience. You&#8217;ll find QR codes embedded throughout this book. I\u00a0<em>highly</em> recommend scanning each one with your mobile device as you encounter them, because they bring this book to life in ways the text alone can&#8217;t.</p>\n<p>(Note: The video and audio links are hosted by a variety of channels and posters, so I can&#8217;t guarantee that every QR code will work as time goes on. In fact, I pretty much <em>can</em> guarantee that someday they won&#8217;t. Every year, I&#8217;ve had to repair around ten percent of the links, so that&#8217;s probably a pretty good benchmark for the &#8220;QR decay&#8221; over time. I hope you&#8217;re able to enjoy the full experience now, and that the essays hold up as good reading even when the media someday expires.)</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy this book as much as I enjoyed creating it over the last eight years. Volume 2 is coming soon, but it won&#8217;t cover Bruce&#8217;s second album.</p>\n<p>Which album will it feature? Only the dice know.</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>Oops.</p>\n", "protected": false}, "author": 1, "featured_media": 0, "comment_status": "open", "ping_status": "open",
