(If New Jerseyans can claim to be the first to realize Bruce&#8217;s potential, Richmonders can rightfully claim to be second.)</p>\n<p>Bruce&#8217;s previous bands had set lists with prominently featured covers, but with Steel Mill, Bruce was rapidly creating his own catalog.</p>\n<p>Some of Bruce&#8217;s early work hinted at the brilliance to come. Others&#8230; well, others sound like what you&#8217;d expect the output of a 21-year-old songwriter in 1970 to sound like.</p>\n<p>Case in point: &#8220;Come On.&#8221;</p>\n<!--[if lt IE 9]><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\">document.createElement('audio');</script><![endif]-->\n<audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-15200-1\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/02-Come-On.mp3?_=1\" /><a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/02-Come-On.mp3\">https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/02-Come-On.mp3</a></audio>\n<p>If &#8220;Come On&#8221; is notable for anything at all, it&#8217;s for the remarkable quality of this surviving recording (who could have known in 1970 that the young band playing at Asbury Park&#8217;s Sunshine In would have such historical significance?) and the power of Bruce&#8217;s vocals, particularly as the song shifts into gear in the third line of the song.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well come on, are you ready</em><br />\n<em>Well the temperature&#8217;s rising and summer&#8217;s coming on</em><br />\n<em>Well come on, don&#8217;t let &#8217;em catch you running &#8217;round here</em><br />\n<em>Well the time has come, let&#8217;s get on</em></p>\n<p>The song itself, however, is a fairly pedestrian call-to-action for young people, inspired by any number of contemporary protest songs&#8211;including &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/04/14/matr-crosby-stills-nash-young-and-springsteen-teach-your-children/\">Teach Your Children</a>,&#8221; which Bruce alludes to twice in the song. (Bruce had a penchant even then for wearing his influences on his sleeves&#8211;see &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/09/04/roll-of-the-dice-changing-children/\">Change It</a>&#8221;\u00a0 for another example of how young Bruce paid tribute to his influences.)</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Yeah come on, are you ready</em><br />\n<em>The bells are ringing and the people are singing their song</em><br />\n<em>Well come on, come on, don&#8217;t you fear it</em><br />\n<em>The world is crying for freedom, can&#8217;t you hear it</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well gather up your children</em><br />\n<em>Bring them down to the riverside</em><br />\n<em>And teach them well, show them good</em><br />\n<em>They got no reason\u00a0to hide</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well gather up them children</em><br />\n<em>Bring them down to the riverside</em><br />\n<em>And treat them well, wish them good</em><br />\n<em>They got no reason\u00a0to hide</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Come on, you gotta be a man now</em><br />\n<em>The time has come, get up and stand now</em><br />\n<em>Come on, don&#8217;t you fear it</em><br />\n<em>The world is crying for freedom</em><br />\n<em>The world is crying for freedom, don&#8217;t you hear it</em></p>\n<p>&#8220;Come On&#8221; won&#8217;t be remembered as one of Bruce&#8217;s best songs, but as a curious postscript, Steel Mill Retro (a modern-day incarnation of Bruce&#8217;s early band, led by original member (and E Streeter) Vini Lopez) officially recorded and released it (with Bruce&#8217;s blessing) in 2005 on their <em>Dead Sea Chronicles\u00a0</em>album&#8211;earning &#8220;Come On&#8221; distinction as a member of Bruce Springsteen&#8217;s catalog of officially released compositions.</p>\n<p><strong>Come On<br />\n</strong><strong>Never recorded</strong><br />\n<strong>Never released</strong><br />\n<strong>First performed:</strong> May 23, 1970 (Richmond, VA)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> August 14, 1970 (Richmond, VA)</p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
