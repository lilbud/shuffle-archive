(See &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/02/01/roll-of-the-dice-mr-jones/\">Mr. Jones</a>&#8221; from that show for the very first live performance of an original Springsteen song.)</p>\n<p>Two weeks later, The Castiles returned to The Left Foot, and once again Father Coleman was ready. The set list that night was primarily comprised of covers, but there was a single (that we know of) Springsteen original.</p>\n<p>Actually, &#8220;Look Into My Window&#8221; was co-written by Bruce and George Theiss, as several of the band&#8217;s earliest original songs were. It&#8217;s incomplete (there were several cuts on the tape), but there&#8217;s enough for us to get a solid sense of what Bruce and George were reaching for.</p>\n<div id=\"v-LLFCEstp-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='568' src='https://videopress.com/embed/LLFCEstp?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>The lyrics are elementary&#8211;only a day after his seventeenth birthday, Bruce hadn&#8217;t yet begun to stretch himself.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Look into my window girl</em><br />\n<em>You&#8217;re lookin&#8217; at me</em><br />\n<em>Cause to get my window girl</em><br />\n<em>Tell me what you see</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Look into my window</em><br />\n<em>Tell me what I&#8217;m like</em><br />\n<em>Look into my window</em><br />\n<em>And don&#8217;t be afraid to try</em></p>\n<p>As for the music, &#8220;Look Into My Window&#8221; is clearly Kinks-inspired. Two weeks prior, The Castiles had played a cover of &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/04/30/cover-me-see-my-friends/\">See My Friends,</a>&#8221; and the similarities in the two songs&#8217; Indian-influenced melodies is striking.</p>\n<p>Although Bruce would quickly grow by leaps and bounds in both his lyrical skill and originality, he&#8217;d continue to wear his musical influences on his sleeve. We&#8217;re not aware of any other known performances of &#8220;Look Into My Window&#8221; (although again, documents from this period are rare), so we might consider this song just a stop along the early journey of a budding songwriter.</p>\n<p><strong>Look Into My Window<br />\nNever recorded</strong><br />\n<strong>Never released</strong><br />\n<strong>First performed:</strong> September 30, 1967 (Freehold, NJ)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> September 30, 1967 (Freehold, NJ)</p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
