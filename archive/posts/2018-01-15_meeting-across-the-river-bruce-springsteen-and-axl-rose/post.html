<p>At the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony in 1994, Rod Stewart and Elton John were slated to perform a duet of “Come Together,” the opening track from The Beatles’ 1969 album <em>Abbey Road</em> that made it all the way to the top of the charts in the U.S.</p>

<p>At the last minute, Rod wasn’t able to make it, so the producers asked Bruce to step in. Bruce declined, so they moved on to Axl Rose, who accepted. Apparently Axl was a more intriguing duet partner than Elton, though, because when Axl asked Bruce to join him, this time Bruce said yes. Axl and Bruce had no warning this was coming, and therefore no rehearsal time.</p>
<p>You’d never know from the performance. Axl would not perform in public again for six years.</p>

<p>In the spring of 2022, Bruce performed “Come Together” in public–this time with Gary Clark, Jr. at the presentation of the 23rd Annual Mark Twain Prize for American Humor to Jon Stewart. Here’s a somewhat distant video of the event to tide you over until it’s televised in June.</p>
