The High Hopes tour was wild and unpredictable, starting with the Australian leg. Early in the tour, Bruce started pulling out a different cover for each show, either by a local artist or something thematic for the venue. The show at the Hunter Valley Hope Estates winery on February 23, 2014 fell into the latter category. Here’s Bruce and the E Street Band opening the show with a cover of Eric Burdon and War’s “Spill the Wine.”

It was a pretty faithful cover–judge for yourself by comparing with the original below:
