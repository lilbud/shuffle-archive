<p>“Go Go Go (Down the Line)” is far from my favorite Roy Orbison song, but it’s certainly one of my favorite highlights from Orbison’s <em>Black and White Night</em> concert–if only for the sight of a completely starstruck Bruce Springsteen (with an “I can’t believe this is actually happening” expression the entire time) playing alongside one of his idols.</p>
<p>Bruce was a week past his 38th birthday when this clip was recorded, but that smile (especially at the 3:20 mark) is the smile of an awestruck kid.</p>

<p>“Go Go Go (Down the Line)” was actually Orbison’s very first self-penned song. released as the rockabilly B-side to “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/07/11/matr-roy-orbison-bruce-springsteen-and-friends-ooby-dooby/">Ooby Dooby</a>” in 1956. It wasn’t a hit at the time, but it attracted notable cover artists like The Hollies, The Drifters, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Johnny Cash over the years.</p>

<p>In my opinion, though, nothing matches that one-time-only performance with Roy, Bruce, Elvis Costello, Tom Waits and more. I can only imagine how Bruce felt, because every time I watch this concert, I can’t believe it actually happened either.</p>
