(Based on interviews decades later, it&#8217;s not clear they ever did.)</p>\n<p>If you ask their fans, though, the work paid off. &#8220;Tumbling Dice&#8221; was a hit for The Rolling Stones, peaking at #7 in the U.S. and #5 in the U.K. when it was released in 1972. It quickly became a live fan favorite for its deceptively laid-back groove and clever gambling-themed lyrics, and just last year\u00a0<em>Rolling Stone </em>ranked it #86 on their 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Tumbling Dice\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0C8i6tOjt-M?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>It apparently became one of Bruce Springsteen&#8217;s favorite Rolling Stones songs, too. When the Stones assembled a cavalcade of guest-stars for their pay-per-view performance from Newark in 2012, Bruce was the local guest of the evening,</p>\n<p>Performing alongside perhaps the only rock frontman who could upstage him (on Jagger&#8217;s own stage no less), Bruce brought his A game moves, strayed far from the teleprompter, and held his own picking up a guitar solo handoff from Ronnie Wood.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Tumbling Dice - The Rolling Stones and Bruce Springsteen (live at Prudential Center, Newark 2012)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NJDjEYcLMr8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>It was such a great performance that they had to do it again&#8211;a year and a half later, at Rock in Rio in Lisbon.
