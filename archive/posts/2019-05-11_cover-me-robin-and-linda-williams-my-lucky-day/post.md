“[My Lucky Day](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/09/02/roll-of-the-dice-my-lucky-day/)” is way up there among my favorite 21st-century Springsteen songs. Since it debuted as the second single from *Working on a Dream* a full decade ago, it’s been a perennial on my setlist wish list.

But as much as I love the song, I’ve always felt that the tenderness of the lyrics was completely overpowered by force of the full-band arrangement.

And then I discovered this cover by husband-and-wife folk singers Robin and Linda Williams, and I’ll be darned: they fixed it.

Take a listen–if you’ve never given “My Lucky Day” much consideration before, you’re about to discover one of Bruce’s loveliest hidden love songs.
