Since it debuted as the second single from <em>Working on a Dream</em> a full decade ago, it’s been a perennial on my setlist wish list.</p>
<p>But as much as I love the song, I’ve always felt that the tenderness of the lyrics was completely overpowered by force of the full-band arrangement.</p>
<p>And then I discovered this cover by husband-and-wife folk singers Robin and Linda Williams, and I’ll be darned: they fixed it.</p>
<p>Take a listen–if you’ve never given “My Lucky Day” much consideration before, you’re about to discover one of Bruce’s loveliest hidden love songs.</p>
