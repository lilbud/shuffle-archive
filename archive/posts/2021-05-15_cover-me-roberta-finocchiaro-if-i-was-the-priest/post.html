<p>If you’re a Springsteen fan, have musical talent, and think you can bring a fresh perspective to one of Bruce’s songs, there’s still time to enter the s<a href="https://www.noiespringsteen.com/contest/">econd annual Cover Me contest!</a></p>
<p>Last June, I featured the Critics’ Prize winner from the first edition here on the Shuffle: Light of Day alum Roberta Finnochiaro and her <a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/06/07/cover-me-roberta-finocchiaro-new-york-city-serenade/">wonderful cover</a> of “New York City Serenade.”</p>

<p>Roberta’s back for this year’s contest, and her entry is just as deep a cut as her first one: “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/12/28/roll-of-the-dice-if-i-was-the-priest/">If I Was the Priest</a>,” one of Bruce’s oldest or newest songs, depending on your perspective.</p>
<p>Roberta has a terrific voice, but as with her cover of “New York City Serenade,” the highlight of her rendition of “If I Was the Priest” is her guitar playing. She’s arranged the song for a solo electric performance, and the last funky minute in particular is bound to get you grooving.</p>

<p>Will Roberta stage a repeat win this year? With entries still rolling in, it’s too soon to handicap. Stay tuned this summer for more great contestants and my coverage of the finals.</p>
