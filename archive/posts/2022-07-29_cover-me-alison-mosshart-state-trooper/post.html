<p>“One of my favorite car songs,” Alison Mosshart told <em>Forbes</em> during the deep heart of the pandemic, “which I just covered and I fucking love is ‘<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/12/22/roll-of-the-dice-state-trooper/">State Trooper</a>,’ by Bruce Springsteen. I’m obsessed with that song. I just can sit and sing it all day. I love how cinematic it is, I love [how] it’s so visual.”</p>
<p>It’s also dark and alienated, which is how a lot of us were feeling in the middle of 2020. Maybe that’s what prompted Mosshart to record a cover and produce a video of it during her at-home sessions that summer.</p>

<p>Mosshart’s version is intense and ominous, laden with eerie effects and a few appropriately salty liberties with Bruce’s lyrics. Oh and she nails that scream, too. If this cover doesn’t make your arm hair stand on end, you’re not paying close enough attention.</p>
