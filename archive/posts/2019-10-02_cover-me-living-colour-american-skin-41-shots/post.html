<p>The band delivered a strong set, and to close the show, they chose a very special cover: Bruce’s “American Skin (41 Shots).”</p>
<p>If you haven’t seen this before, trust me: you need to.</p>
<p>The arrangement is intense and original, and Corey Glover’s vocal performance is absolutely mesmerizing. I can only imagine what was going through his mind as tears streaked down his face during the crossfire (and that’s only barely a metaphor) of Will Calhoun’s drums.</p>

<p>It’s not one of the most well-known Springsteen covers out there, but it’s certainly one of the strongest.</p>
<p>And without question, the most heartfelt.</p>
