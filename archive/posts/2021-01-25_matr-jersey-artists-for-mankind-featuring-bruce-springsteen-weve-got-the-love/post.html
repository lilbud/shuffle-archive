<p>It doesn’t get more eighties than this. (And I mean that in the best possible way.)</p>
<p>Rock musicians have long been focused on social activism, but in the mid-eighties, there was a groundswell of collective action that seemed to sweep up virtually every active recording artist.</p>
<p>From Band Aid to Live Aid to Farm Aid (and of course <em>U.S.A. for Africa</em>), rock’s most popular artists and bands teamed up to drive awareness and raise funds for important national and multi-national causes through live concert events and original studio recordings.</p>
<p>In 1985, the musicians from the Jersey Shore music scene decided to band together to make a difference in their own community. Garry Tallent and Tim Ryan formed a group called Jersey Artists for Mankind (J.A.M.) to help combat hunger in New Jersey, and Joel Krauss and Bobby Bandiera contributed their writing talents for what would become the A-side for their single: “We’ve Got the Love.”</p>
<p>In December a core group of artists recorded the backing track, and on January 13, 1986, over 450 local voices assembled at The Stone Pony for a raucous rehearsal and recording session. So much talent showed up that the session had to be split in two–one session for those under 21 early in the evening, and another later that night for the grown-ups.</p>

<p>Once the backing track and “choir” were captured, local legends contributed their talents for vocal and instrumental solos. Bruce and Clarence contributed instantly recognizable guitar and sax solos, and as for spotlight vocalists, see how many you can recognize.</p>

<p>The single was released on May 16, 1986 and garnered national media attention, largely thanks to Bruce’s participation.</p>

<p>Jersey Artists for Mankind remained active through the remainder of the decade, assembling in various combinations and venues to continue their mission to combat local hunger, but they never again received the media spotlight that greeted the release of their 1986 single.</p>
