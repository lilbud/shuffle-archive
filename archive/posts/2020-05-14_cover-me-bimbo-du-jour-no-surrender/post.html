<p>Bimbo du Jour sure did.</p>
<p>I wish I knew more about this band other than that they had two albums back in the nineties, they don’t appear to have issued anything since, their debut album includes a punk treatment of Goffin and King’s “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/01/20/cover-me-will-you-love-me-tomorrow/">Will You Love Me Tomorrow</a>”  which works way better than it should, and their awesomely crunchy cover of “No Surrender” comes from their <em>Six Ways From Sunday</em> album, which you can stream on your favorite platforms.</p>
<p>But even if I did know the band’s full story, I probably couldn’t summarize their sound better than the album’s official description:</p>
<p>“[P]ut Blondie, a little Clash and Pistols, a pinch of Bush and a dash of Gwen into an El Nino blender, add single malt scotch, turn it on 11 and record the results.”</p>
<p>Yep, that pretty much captures it. Take a listen:</p>

<p>Bimbo du Jour’s cover of “No Surrender” might have been under the radar at the time, but it <em>almost</em> of made the cut for <em>One Step Up/Two Steps Back: The Songs of Bruce Springsteen</em>, a 1998 tribute album with some standout covers.</p>
<p>Some of the best tracks from that project turned out to be outtakes, released on an EP called <em>Downbound Train</em> that was so under the radar, you needed sonar to spot it. (See Billy Mann’s “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/03/27/cover-me-billy-mann-two-hearts/">Two Hearts”</a> for another great cut from that EP.)</p>
