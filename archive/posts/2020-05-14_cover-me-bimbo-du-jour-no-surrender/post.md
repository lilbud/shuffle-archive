Deep down, we always knew that "[No Surrender](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/11/18/roll-of-the-dice-no-surrender/)" was secretly punk, didn't we?

Bimbo du Jour sure did.

I wish I knew more about this band other than that they had two albums back in the nineties, they don't appear to have issued anything since, their debut album includes a punk treatment of Goffin and King's "[Will You Love Me Tomorrow](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/01/20/cover-me-will-you-love-me-tomorrow/)" which works way better than it should, and their awesomely crunchy cover of "No Surrender" comes from their *Six Ways From Sunday* album, which you can stream on your favorite platforms.

But even if I did know the band's full story, I probably couldn't summarize their sound better than the album's official description:

"[P]ut Blondie, a little Clash and Pistols, a pinch of Bush and a dash of Gwen into an El Nino blender, add single malt scotch, turn it on 11 and record the results."

Yep, that pretty much captures it. Take a listen:

Bimbo du Jour's cover of "No Surrender" might have been under the radar at the time, but it *almost* of made the cut for *One Step Up/Two Steps Back: The Songs of Bruce Springsteen*, a 1998 tribute album with some standout covers.

Some of the best tracks from that project turned out to be outtakes, released on an EP called *Downbound Train* that was so under the radar, you needed sonar to spot it. (See Billy Mann's "[Two Hearts"](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/03/27/cover-me-billy-mann-two-hearts/) for another great cut from that EP.)

Anyone out there have any info on this band? If so, please drop a comment–I'd love to learn more.
