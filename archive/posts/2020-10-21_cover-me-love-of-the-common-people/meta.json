And yet, other than Paul Young&#8217;s minor hit with it (it came close but never cracked the U.S. Top 40, although it fared much better in Europe) and Nicky Thomas&#8217; #9 UK hit in 1970, &#8220;Love of the Common People&#8221; never seemed to resonate with the public as much as it did with recording artists.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Paul Young - Love of the Common People (Official Video)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SVmjKHkgxis?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>It resonated with Bruce Springsteen, though. He broke it out in the final days of his 2006 Seeger Sessions Tour, premiering it as an encore-opener in Valencia. The song went over so well that Bruce moved it to the main set and performed it an astonishing seven times in ten days. (I have to remind myself sometimes that there was a not-that-distant time when Bruce played shows that frequently.)</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen with the Sessions Band - Love of the Common People (Live In Dublin)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7JrXlGIpbRA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>After a couple of performances, the arrangement was solid enough and the band&#8217;s performance confident enough for Bruce to capture it on video and audio.
