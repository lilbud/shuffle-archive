I still loved his music as much as always&#8211;in fact, his last album,\u00a0<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/08/08/album-companion-tunnel-of-love/\"><em>Tunnel of Love</em></a> was and remains my all-time favorite&#8211;but it had been four-and-a-half years since we&#8217;d heard any new music from him, and time and tastes had moved forward.</p>\n<p>For the sake of old times, I picked up the albums (I couldn&#8217;t be bothered dealing with the midnight madness at Tower Records, though), and on my first listen I was mostly underwhelmed. With few exceptions (most notably the title track), I didn&#8217;t care for the production on\u00a0<em>Human Touch</em>, and while I liked\u00a0<em>Lucky Town</em> just fine, it just didn&#8217;t\u00a0<em>sound</em> like Bruce.</p>\n<p>Which was precisely Bruce&#8217;s intention of course, but I didn&#8217;t know that then. All I knew was that his voice sounded different, his subject matter was lighter, and the\u00a0sound I&#8217;d come to know and love was just plain gone. &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/06/01/roll-of-the-dice-if-i-should-fall-behind/\">If I Should Fall Behind</a>&#8221; immediately stood out as a lovely and destined-to-be-timeless ballad, and &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/03/17/roll-of-the-dice-better-days/\">Better Days</a>&#8221; was fun, but nothing else lodged in my brain on first listen.</p>\n<p>A day or two later, I listened to\u00a0<em>Lucky Town</em> again. And this time, I must have been paying closer attention, because when I listened to &#8220;Local Hero,&#8221; I laughed out loud.\u00a0<em>There you are</em>, I thought: &#8220;Local Hero&#8221; is such a delightfully meta commentary on the downhill side of fame that I still chuckle every time I hear it, even decades later. It also has some of Bruce&#8217;s\u00a0 cleverest, most incisive lyrics on record.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Local Hero\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BExTE1vDhxs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>It&#8217;s funny to think about it now, but there actually was a time when it seemed&#8211;both to fans and to the artist&#8211;that Bruce Springsteen was in his post-stardom period. His fame and popularity peaked during the\u00a0<em>Born in the U.S.A. </em>era, and his critical acclaim crested with his follow-up,\u00a0<em>Tunnel of Love</em>.\u00a0 Four years is like a generation in music, and that&#8217;s how long it had been since Bruce had released an album. &#8220;Local Hero&#8221; chronicles what it must have felt like to be Bruce at that time. (The irony, of course, is that Bruce was only in a mid-career lull&#8211;he&#8217;d go on to even greater heights in terms of stature and ticket sales if not in album sales&#8211;but it would take the better part of a decade to reclaim his position.)</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve read takes on &#8220;Local Hero&#8221; that interpret the song literally&#8211;and certainly it works on that level. But I&#8217;ve always felt from my first (well, second) listen that his &#8220;town&#8221; wasn&#8217;t a little burg in New Jersey, but rather the rock and roll pantheon.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s dig into the lyrics, but let&#8217;s first take one more listen to the song&#8211;this time in one of its earliest live performances, on\u00a0<em>MTV Unplugged</em>.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Local Hero (MTV Plugged - Official HD Video)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/96abVWWm8UA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>To me, this live 1992 live performance will always be the definitive version of the song. His new band is firing on all cylinders, and &#8220;Local Hero&#8221; in particular seems perfectly suited to their sound. While the E Street Band would tackle it in later years, they would never match the lean taut power of the 1992-93 band arrangement, and Bruce in particular seems so carefree and liberated from the audience expectations that he&#8217;d carried for so long. There&#8217;s a\u00a0<em>freedom</em> in this performance that seems very much tied to this period in Bruce&#8217;s career.</p>\n<p>It probably had a lot to do with the song, though, as well. It had to be therapeutic to write, much less sing, lyrics like these:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>I was driving through my hometown, I was just kinda killing time</em><br />\n<em>When I seen a face staring out of a black velvet painting from the window of the Five And Dime</em><br />\n<em>I couldn&#8217;t quite recall the name but the pose looked familiar to me</em><br />\n<em>So I asked the salesgirl &#8220;Who was that man between the Doberman and Bruce Lee?&#8221;</em><br />\n<em>She said &#8220;Just a local hero&#8221;, &#8220;Local hero&#8221; she said with a smile</em><br />\n<em>&#8220;Yeah a local hero, he used to live here for a while&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>Yeah, this was based on an actual event that preceded Bruce&#8217;s move from New Jersey to California (although I personally believe the conversation is too cute to be anything but apocryphal). And there&#8217;s certainly something appealing in the notion of time having moved on so much that even in his own stomping grounds, Bruce might go unrecognized, considered just a has-been local hero.</p>\n<p>But read it again, and this time consider his hometown as &#8220;rock music&#8221; instead of &#8220;Freehold,&#8221; and the song takes on larger meaning and greater resonance.</p>\n<p>Bruce had very much been killing time in the realm of popular music; for some time, he&#8217;d had nothing to say and no compelling reason to say it. His life had changed so much&#8211;he was now a parent and a husband, he&#8217;d moved to California, he&#8217;d broken up his band&#8211;that it&#8217;s easy to see how he might be unrecognizable to himself.\u00a0 While he might not be finished as a musician, he might very well have believed that he was past his icon phase. He&#8217;d blown it all up to free himself and try something new.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>I met a stranger dressed in black at the train station, he said &#8220;Son your soul can be saved&#8221;</em><br />\n<em>There&#8217;s beautiful women, nights of low living, and some dangerous money to be made</em><br />\n<em>There&#8217;s a big town &#8216;cross the whiskey line and if we turn the right cards up</em><br />\n<em>Well they make us boss, the devil pays off, and them folks that are real hard up</em><br />\n<em>They get their local hero, yeah somebody with the right style</em><br />\n<em>They get their local hero, yeah somebody with just the right smile</em></p>\n<p>Now certainly this verse is symbolic, but it&#8217;s also insightful. Bruce saw himself as having made a deal with the devil, and it paid off. He&#8217;d achieved fame, fortune, adventure, and misadventure&#8211;he&#8217;d was made the &#8220;boss&#8221; (a clever wink, there) and became the hero that music needed at that time and place.</p>\n<p>The bridge that follows is one of Bruce&#8217;s best ever:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Well I learned my job, I learned it well</em><br />\n<em>Fit myself with religion and a story to tell</em><br />\n<em>First they made me the king then they made me pope</em><br />\n<em>Well then they brought the rope</em></p>\n<p>How fortunate to be self-aware enough to know the arc of your life as you&#8217;re travelling along it. The irony, of course, is that Bruce was still too much on the curve to know that he hadn&#8217;t been made pope yet, only king. Papacy still awaited off in the future, and the rope&#8230; well, we&#8217;ve seen hints of it from time to time, but Bruce has escaped the noose time and again as well.</p>\n<p>Bruce&#8217;s final verse trades the humor for courageous confession:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>I woke to a gypsy girl saying &#8220;Drink this&#8221;, well my hands had lost all sensation</em><br />\n<em>These days I&#8217;m feeling all right except I can&#8217;t tell my courage from my desperation</em><br />\n<em>From the tainted chalice well I drunk some heady wine</em><br />\n<em>Tonight I&#8217;m laying here but there&#8217;s something in my ear saying there&#8217;s a little town just beneath the floodline</em></p>\n<p>Bruce intentionally uprooted his life and career, and he was happy with his new life, home, and family. But if it seemed like he&#8217;d made peace with post-stardom&#8230; well, his muse may have gone walkabout, but she was never far away. That gypsy girl kept feeding him sips of wine, the same &#8220;wine&#8221; he&#8217;d drink in while on stage, in his element. And while he might never play to the crowds he&#8217;d entertained at his peak, there was always a little town&#8230; and a little town&#8230; and a little town. All waiting for him.</p>\n<p>As we do.</p>\n<p>Was it courage that led Bruce to put himself back out there before a public that had moved on without him, with an unfamiliar sound and an unfamiliar band? Or was it the desperation of an artist who\u00a0<em>needed</em> their attention? Bruce couldn&#8217;t tell the difference, and maybe it didn&#8217;t matter anyway.</p>\n<p>Maybe it was both: a calling and an act of bravery.</p>\n<p>After all, isn&#8217;t that what makes a hero, local or otherwise?</p>\n<p>&#8212;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Local Hero&#8221; was a mainstay throughout World Tour 1992, although Bruce dropped it from the set when the tour resumed in 1993. Perhaps he was feeling his oats by then.</p>\n<p>In the quarter century since, Bruce has only played &#8220;Local Hero&#8221; twice, and it&#8217;s telling that neither time could come anywhere close to matching the sincerity and power of his 1992 performances.</p>\n<p>The first 21st century appearance of &#8220;Local Hero&#8221; was at the tail end of the Rising Tour, when Bruce was rediscovering his &#8220;missing years,&#8221; pulling out HT/LT chestnuts for their E Street Band debuts in rapid succession.</p>\n<p>But while Soozie&#8217;s violin was a nice addition to the arrangement, the performance was stately, and Bruce seemed disconnected from the spirit of the song. If he was feeling it, it didn&#8217;t show.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Local Hero Bruce Springsteen 9/21/2003 Detroit\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PDHsvzZGpPk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>It was almost a full decade before Bruce tried again, this time by request on the Wrecking Ball Tour in Leeds.
