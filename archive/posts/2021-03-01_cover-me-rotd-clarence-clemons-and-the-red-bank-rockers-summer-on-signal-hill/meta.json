When Bruce donated the music to Clarence for an instrumental, he retitled it &#8220;Summer on Signal Hill.&#8221;</p>\n<p>(Signal Hill is most likely a reference to Telegraph Hill, the name of Bruce&#8217;s street (as well as a nearby park) where he lived from the Born to Run-era through 1981, which leads me to suspect that Bruce actually wrote the song even earlier than 1982.)</p>\n<p>The retitling appears to have been a late decision, however, because when the song was originally issued as the B-side to &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/03/01/cover-me-a-womans-got-the-power/\">A Woman&#8217;s Got the Power</a>&#8221; in Australia, it was actually called &#8220;Now and Forever.&#8221;</p>\n<p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-attachment-id=\"25731\" data-permalink=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/03/01/cover-me-rotd-clarence-clemons-and-the-red-bank-rockers-summer-on-signal-hill/nowandforever/#main\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/nowandforever.jpg?fit=600%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"nowandforever\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/nowandforever.jpg?fit=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/nowandforever.jpg?fit=600%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-25731\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/nowandforever.jpg?resize=758%2C758&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"758\" height=\"758\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/nowandforever.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/nowandforever.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/nowandforever.jpg?resize=550%2C550&amp;ssl=1 550w, https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/nowandforever.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/nowandforever.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 758px) 100vw, 758px\" /></p>\n<p>Dave Marsh set the record straight in the very next issue of <em>Backstreets, </em>but for many fans, the is-it-or-isn&#8217;t-it debate continued.</p>\n<p>In 2002, <em>Backstreets\u00a0</em>finally got a chance to definitively settle the matter when Christopher Phillips had a chance to interview The Big Man himself. When asked who the studio musicians were on &#8220;Summer on Signal Hill,&#8221; Clarence flatly stated that they were his band, The Red Bank Rockers.</p>\n<p>Chris pressed once more: &#8220;It sounds for all the world like the E Street Band, and that&#8217;s sort of been an ongoing&#8211;&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s because the song was written like that, written by Bruce,&#8221; Clarence replied. &#8220;It&#8217;s his signature sound. Other musicians may play, but his songs will sound like him, sound like the E Street Band. So you&#8217;ve got that real E Street Band sound in there. But that was my band.&#8221;</p>\n<p>So we can consider the matter settled.
