<p>Before Pearl Jam there was Bad Radio. They never released an album, but Bad Radio still has a claim to fame: their frontman was Eddie Vedder.</p>
<p>And even in his Bad Radio days, Eddie was a Springsteen fan. He recorded this lovely cover of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/08/17/roll-of-the-dice-one-step-up/">One Step Up</a>” in a friend’s recording studio in Chicago sometime in the late 1980s.</p>
