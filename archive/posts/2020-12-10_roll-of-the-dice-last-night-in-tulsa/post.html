<p>Every once in a while, Bruce writes a pure pop song like “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/05/04/roll-of-the-dice-surprise-surprise/">Surprise, Surprise</a>” or “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/roll-of-the-dice-album-by-album/">You’ve Got It</a>” that requires no lyrical analysis–everything we need to know is right there on the surface.</p>
<p>That was as true at the beginning as it is now. Take “Last Night in Tulsa,” for example.</p>

<p>Bruce wrote and performed “Last Night in Tulsa” during his Bruce Springsteen Band period, and although there are at least three known performances of it, this is the only one that widely circulates.</p>
<p>It’s okay.</p>
<p>There’s nothing to find fault with in “Last Night in Tulsa,” but neither is there anything particularly memorable about it.</p>
<p>During his Steel Mill and Bruce Springsteen Band periods, Bruce tended to write songs that were showcases for the band’s musical chops, so even when the lyrics were slight (which was sometimes the case), at least we could count on some sublime solos and jaw-dropping jams.</p>
<p>We don’t even get those with “Last Night in Tulsa.”</p>
<p>David Sancious gets a turn in the spotlight but is relatively restrained; Bobby Feigenbaum similarly isn’t given much room to impress during his solo. There’s some nice guitar interplay between Bruce and Steve Van Zandt, but nothing that compares to their more memorable contemporary performances.</p>
<p>Lyrically, “Last Night in Tulsa” is a simple road song of the sort that any touring musician who’s lingered just a bit too long with a comely companion would appreciate and identify with.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Last night in Tulsa</em><br/>
<em>And I’m goin’ back home</em><br/>
<em>It’s my last night in Tulsa</em><br/>
<em>And I’m goin’ back home</em><br/>
<em>I been in town just one night too long</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>My bags all packed up at the station</em><br/>
<em>Gotta take it on the Tulsa line</em><br/>
<em>My bags all packed up at the station</em><br/>
<em>I gotta take that all out on the Tulsa line</em><br/>
<em>There ain’t never been a feelin’ so fine</em><br/>
<em>As laying out in some of that warm, warm, warm sunshine</em><br/>
<em>And everything looks surely grand</em><br/>
<em>With that fine little woman of mine</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>I remember all them sweet kisses</em><br/>
<em>And I know I’m gonna miss her</em><br/>
<em>She was fine, that woman of mine</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Last night in Tulsa</em><br/>
<em>And I’m going back home</em><br/>
<em>It’s my last night in Tulsa</em><br/>
<em>I’m just tired of travelling right along</em><br/>
<em>I been in this town one night too long</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Last night in Tulsa</em><br/>
<em>My last night in Tulsa</em><br/>
<em>My last night I’m coming home</em><br/>
<em>Coming home, coming home, coming home</em></p>
<p>See what I mean? “Last Night in Tulsa” is pleasant enough, and I suspect that if I had a clean, clear performance (instead of the distant recording above), I might even listen to it once in a while.</p>
<p>But it’s not likely to make any fan’s favorite list, and even if Bruce seems to be rediscovering his pre-label music of late, I wouldn’t count on Bruce acknowledging “Last Night in Tulsa” any time soon (if ever).</p>
