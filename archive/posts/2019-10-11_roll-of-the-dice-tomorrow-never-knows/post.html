<p>It’s easy to forget about “Tomorrow Never Knows.” Bruce has never performed it live, and I’ve never seen a fan ask for it or heard Bruce talk about it. And yet, it’s arguably one of the songs that best defines the album on which it’s hidden away.</p>
<p>Bruce wrote “Tomorrow Never Knows” during the mixing stages of <em>Magic–</em>in fact, it was one of the very first songs written for the album that would become <em>Working on a Dream. </em></p>
<p>That first group of songs also included “<a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/11/25/roll-of-the-dice-what-love-can-do/">What Love Can Do</a>,” “This Life,” “<a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/03/26/roll-of-the-dice-life-itself/">Life Itself</a>,” and “<a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/09/02/roll-of-the-dice-my-lucky-day/">My Lucky Day</a>,” and together with “Tomorrow Never Knows,” it’s clear that Bruce was beginning to come to terms with aging in a way that he really hadn’t addressed before.</p>
<p><em>Working on a Dream</em> would develop into a fascinating document of an artist taking stock of his life, love, family, friends and body of work. It’s the gateway to all of his later work, both musically and lyrically–and “Tomorrow Never Knows” is one of the plainest yet loveliest examples.</p>
<p>Take a careful listen to the song below, and use headphones if you have them to get the full effect.</p>

<p>When the album was first released, “Tomorrow Never Knows” struck me as what it would sound like if the Sessions Band covered a Beatles song (perhaps that was intentional given the song’s allusional title), but when I listen to it now, I hear a clear throughline to <em>Western Stars</em>.</p>
<p>Edward Horst’s string and horn arrangements (although not credited, there are clearly French horns in the mix) are understatedly perfect, and there’s a gentle ease to the entire track.</p>
<p>That ease is deliberate. Bruce uses it to underscore the song’s message, which is: Don’t waste the time you’ve been granted. Use it however you will, but use it well.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the song speaks for itself–until the last verse, that is. That one is worth discussing, so take a read through the lyrics, and I’ll meet you on the other side.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Where the cold wind blows</em><br/>
<em>Tomorrow never knows</em><br/>
<em>Where your sweet smile goes</em><br/>
<em>Tomorrow never knows</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>You and me we been standing here my dear</em><br/>
<em>Waiting for our time to come</em><br/>
<em>Where the green grass grows</em><br/>
<em>Tomorrow never knows</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>In the field your long hair flowed</em><br/>
<em>Down by the Tildenberry tracks</em><br/>
<em>There ‘neath the water tower</em><br/>
<em>I carried you on my back</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Over the rusted spikes of that highway of steel</em><br/>
<em>When no more thunder sounds</em><br/>
<em>Where the time goes</em><br/>
<em>Tomorrow never knows</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Well he who waits for the day’s riches will be lost</em><br/>
<em>In the whispering tide</em><br/>
<em>Where the river flows</em><br/>
<em>Tomorrow never knows</em></p>
<p>Bruce has said on more than one occasion that most of his songs hide a single line that contain its key, and “Tomorrow Never Knows” is no exception. If you want to know the message of the song, look no further than:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>“He who waits for the day’s riches will be lost in the whispering tide.”</em></p>
<p>That line is significant, because without it, “Tomorrow Never Knows” would be lyrically indistinguishable from “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/04/04/roll-of-the-dice-kingdom-of-days/">Kingdom of Days</a>” on the same album.</p>
<p>In both songs, Bruce addresses his life partner, but where the latter song is time suspended, “Tomorrow Never Knows” seizes the day. “Kingdom of Days” revels in the richness of a lifelong love; “Tomorrow Never Knows” recognizes that even as our love grows deeper, we move ever closer to its end.</p>
<p>Although it almost always seems to earn me scorn when I say it, I consider <em>Working on a Dream </em>to be one of Bruce’s very best albums, and it’s certainly one of his most cohesive and considered.</p>
<p>Taken as a whole, it presents a snapshot of an artist truly coming to terms with aging and mortality, and rather than fear it, Bruce embraces it, setting an example for those of us coming up behind him.</p>
<p>“Tomorrow Never Knows” and “Kingdom of Days” contain words to live by, for those of us fortunate enough to be in a position to follow them.</p>
