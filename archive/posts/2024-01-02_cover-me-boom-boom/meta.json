There are reports (although no recording) of him playing it in 1974 and two known outings a decade later.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the earliest recorded Springsteen performance of &#8220;Boom Boom,&#8221; performed with John Eddie and the Frontstreet Runners at Patrix in New Brunswick in January 1984. Bruce is clearly influenced primarily by The Animals&#8217; version, liberally lifting and playing it in an arrangement very close to the one he&#8217;d use on tour four years later.</p>\n<div id=\"v-jDpsrq4O-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='426' src='https://videopress.com/embed/jDpsrq4O?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>Now, about that Tunnel of Love Tour version: if the 1984 version smokes, the 1988 version absolutely sizzles&#8230; particularly when Bruce and Patti enter each other&#8217;s field of gravity.

In April, Julianne even told <em>Rolling Stone\u00a0</em>that she and Bruce weren&#8217;t ruling out having kids in the future.</p>\n<p>But by late May, rumors abounded in the New York press about marital strife in the Springsteen/Phillips household, and Patti Scialfa had already been suggested as an involved party. A few weeks later, there was photographic evidence in the tabloids.</p>\n<p>And right in the middle, on May 10th in Bloomington, Minnesota, Bruce replaced his reliable nightly &#8220;Be True&#8221; with &#8220;Boom Boom&#8221; as the second song of the evening, immediately establishing and escalating the chemistry between Bruce and his back-up singer.</p>\n<div id=\"v-NKEsi6O4-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='426' src='https://videopress.com/embed/NKEsi6O4?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>Although it quickly returned to the set list as the third song (following &#8220;Boom Boom&#8221;),\u00a0 &#8220;Be True&#8221; made its final tour appearance on June 15, 1988&#8211;the night before Italian newspapers published photos of Bruce and Patti in their skivvies on their hotel room balcony, essentially outing their affair to the world. Coincidence? Decide for yourself.</p>\n<p>We wouldn&#8217;t hear &#8220;Be True&#8221; again at a proper E Street Band Show for over a decade. &#8220;Boom Boom,&#8221; however,\u00a0would continue to make select appearances at Jersey Shore club gigs over the next few years, and one far-flung gig in Berlin with Wolfgang Niedecken in 1995.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Boom Boom\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cHiHb3fMJdA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;Boom Boom&#8221; reappeared on the E Street stage in late in the Magic Tour, and since then it&#8217;s made a cameo or three in every E Street Band Tour since.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s my favorite &#8220;Boom Boom&#8221; performance of the modern era&#8211;from the legendary final show of the Working on a Dream Tour in Buffalo, on November 22, 2009.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Springsteen &quot; Boom Boom&quot; Buffalo 11-22-09\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WMcGHw305MI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>None of the post-1988 performances have matched the remarkable passion on display during the Tunnel of Love Tour, however, and perhaps that&#8217;s to be expected&#8211;nothing&#8217;s more combustible than the early days of a relationship.</p>\n<p>Still, &#8220;Boom Boom&#8221; remains a reliable adrenaline booster for any show it appears in, and odds are strong that we&#8217;ll hear it again at least once on the next E Street Band Tour.</p>\n<p><strong>Boom Boom<br />\nFirst performed:</strong> April 26, 1974 (Providence, RI)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> September 14, 2016 (Foxborough, MA)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>Coincidence, subconscious, or intentional?
