meta-description: Ronnie Spector does an admirable cover of “Brilliant Disguise” — right up until the coda. You might not be able to unhear that part.

Here’s a Springsteen cover that’s flown largely under the radar… perhaps deservedly so.

Don’t get me wrong: I’m a huge Ronnie Spector fan, and it’s nice to hear her take a run at one of Bruce’s songs given their long association and friendship.

And “” is actually a pretty neat choice for her; she’s so closely associated with the more innocent crush/love songs of the sixties, that it’s fascinating to hear her tackle a song that grapples with the reality of relationships.

Her voice is in fine form on this 2001 recording, and I have no problem with artists flipping the gender of a song’s lyrics, even though it shouldn’t really be necessary.

But, Ronnie… that coda.

You had me until the coda. That was unforgivable.

Whoa-oh-oh-oh indeed.
