<p>Bruce’s connection with Dion DiMucci goes way back to 1975 (even further if you count a second-degree association between Dion and Steve Van Zandt when Steve and The Dovells backed Dion in a 1972 show in Miami), and Bruce has called Dion “the link between Sinatra and rock and roll.”</p>
<p>The two have performed together on stage in every decade since the 1970s, so it was perhaps only a matter of time before Dion tried his hand at covering one or two of Bruce’s songs.</p>
<p>Dion first covered Bruce in 1992 in a <a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/09/07/cover-me-dion-if-i-should-fall-behind/">doo-wop version</a> of Bruce’s 1992 standard “<a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/06/01/roll-of-the-dice-if-i-should-fall-behind/">If I Should Fall Behind</a>.” His second cover came eight years later on his <em>Deja Nu</em> album, with a loving reading of his former cover’s album-mate, “<a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/06/04/roll-of-the-dice-book-of-dreams/">Book of Dreams</a>.”</p>
<p>In a 2000 NPR interview, Dion explained why “Book of Dreams” was so special to him:</p>

<p>Let’s take a listen to Dion’s lovely version of “Book of Dreams.” It’s both faithful to the album version yet distinctly Dion. I have to imagine Bruce strongly approves.</p>
