Some songs completely transform when you sing them with someone else.

Just as “[Brilliant Disguise](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/02/06/roll-of-the-dice-brilliant-disguise/)” morphs from a song about betrayal and estrangement when sung alone into a song of acceptance and commitment when performed as a duet, so does “[Be True](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/12/02/roll-of-the-dice-be-true/)” blossom from a “[Two Hearts](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/05/28/roll-of-the-dice-two-hearts/)“-style pep talk into a pledge of intimacy and devotion.

Allow Lorenzo Bertocchini and Elizabeth Lee to demonstrate with their breathtakingly tender and beautiful cover of “Be True” from the 2010 Italian tribute album, *For You 2.*

Bertocchini is superb on his acoustic guitar and harmonica, and Gabriele Zolli’s violin is just lovely–but what truly elevates this cover are the world-weary vocals from Lorenzo and Elizabeth. We get the clear sense that these two characters aren’t young, naïve lovers. They’ve been around a time or two, which makes their pledges all the more meaningful and a happy ending much more satisfying.

Tribute albums can be hit or miss, but this one’s a bullseye.
