Bruce never *officially* covered The Hollies’ “I’m Alive,” but if you’re willing to stretch the definition a bit, you can hear the E Street Band take a run at it during a soundcheck in Passaic more than forty years ago.

It’s only a 90-second or so excerpt, but it’s enough for us to tell that it’s a pretty faithful cover arrangement. (You can stop after the 1:30 mark unless you just like hearing the band work out various parts of the arrangement.)

The original 1965 recording by The Hollies was a the band’s first Number One hit in the UK, topping the charts for three weeks. It wasn’t as big a hit in the U.S., but it did chart and peaked at #84.
