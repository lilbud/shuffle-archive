<p>“<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/08/01/roll-of-the-dice-radio-nowhere/">Radio Nowhere</a>” doesn’t get nearly as much cover love as it deserves (although <a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/01/31/cover-me-town-bike-radio-nowhere/">Town Bike’s spectacular version</a> still rates as one of my all-time favorite Springsteen covers).</p>
<p>But Canadian singer-songwriter Northcote (a.k.a. Matthew Goud) gave “Radio Nowhere” some attention back in 2016 with his wonderful B-side rendition.</p>

<p>Goud’s voice is often compared with Bruce’s, and “Radio Nowhere” fits him like a glove. His acoustic arrangement works perfectly, his lone guitar highlighting the isolation that resides at the heart of Bruce’s song but that is subsumed by the original’s uptempo rock arrangement.</p>
<p>Goud’s vocals are no less fiery and passionate than Bruce’s electric original, however. Even in this stripped down cover, “Radio Nowhere” rocks.</p>
