From the Darkness on the Edge of Town tour’s November 16, 1978 show in Toronto: “Ready Teddy,” first recorded as a B-side by Little Richard in June 1956 and performed by Elvis Presley on *The Ed Sullivan Show* later that year.

It’s a great opener, so it’s a surprise that this was a true one-off–Bruce never played it with the E Street Band again. (He did play it during a handful of 1982 bar appearances, and once at a 1991 benefit, though.)
