<p>Friend of the blog Jesse Jackson graciously invited me to be a guest on his excellent podcast, <em>S<a href="http://setlustingbruce.libsyn.com/">et Lusting Bruce</a></em>, a few weeks back, and I had a blast with Jesse in a wide-ranging conversation.</p>
<p>If you care to check it out, here’s a link to the <a href="http://directory.libsyn.com/episode/index/id/6308286">episode</a>–check out a few of them while you’re there, because Jesse offers the community an entertaining, fascinating look not just at Bruce’s music but at the nature of what it means to be a fan of Bruce and his art.</p>
<p>Thanks, Jesse–keep ’em coming!</p>
