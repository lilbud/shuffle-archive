Friend of the blog Jesse Jackson graciously invited me to be a guest on his excellent podcast, *S[et Lusting Bruce](https://setlustingbruce.libsyn.com/)*, a few weeks back, and I had a blast with Jesse in a wide-ranging conversation.

If you care to check it out, here’s a link to the [episode](https://directory.libsyn.com/episode/index/id/6308286)–check out a few of them while you’re there, because Jesse offers the community an entertaining, fascinating look not just at Bruce’s music but at the nature of what it means to be a fan of Bruce and his art.

Thanks, Jesse–keep ’em coming!
