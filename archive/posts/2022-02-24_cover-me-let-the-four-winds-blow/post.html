The New Orleans pianist and singer-songwriter was one of rock’s foremost pioneers and is credited with one of the very first rock and roll singles.</p>
<p>So it’s a little surprising that Bruce hasn’t covered him more than he has–and that we have to go all the way back to 1974 to find the best example.</p>
<p>But oh, what an example.</p>
<p>“Let the Four Winds Blow” was never one of Domino’s greatest hits. Peaking at #15, the 1961 single stood in the shadow of many other more successful Domino tracks.</p>

<p>(Domino’s recording wasn’t even the original version of the song. Although he’d co-written it, it was his collaborator Dave Bartholomew who first took it to market in 1955.)</p>

<p>“I’m Ready,” another Domino single, notched lower still when it was released in 1959.</p>

<p>But something about those two tracks grabbed the attention of a young Bruce Springsteen, who covered “Let the Four Winds Blow” with the E Street Band throughout 1974 and appended “I’m Ready” to it for a few shows that June.</p>
<p>In June 1974, the E Street Band hadn’t yet fully left its Bruce Springsteen Band days behind. With David Sancious on keys and–for a brief moment in time–“Boom” Carter on the drums, the E Street Band stood at the intersection of jazz and rock, and nowhere can we hear that gumbo more clearly than in their performance of “Let the Four Winds Blow.”</p>
<p>Take a listen to their performance below and prepare to be blown away by The Big Man at his most ferocious and carried along by the light-on-his-keys Sancious at his ivory-tickling best.</p>

<p>By the time the band segues into “I’m Ready,” the band is operating at full force, careening through a nearly twelve-minute performance before crashing to a mic-drop of a finish.</p>
<p>It’s one of the finest moments of that transitional incarnation of the E Street Band, and while Bruce would cover Fats Domino again someday, it would never be quite like this.</p>
