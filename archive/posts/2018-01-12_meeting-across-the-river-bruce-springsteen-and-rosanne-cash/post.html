<p>“Sea of Heartbreak” first became a hit in 1961, when Don Gibson took it all the way to #2 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart.</p>

<p>If only Johnny Cash had released it as a single when he recorded it for his 1996 <em>Unchained </em>album, “Sea of Heartbreak” might have charted for <em>four</em> consecutive decades.</p>
<p>He didn’t though, and the streak ended. But that didn’t stop Cash’s daughter Rosanne from taking a run at it herself in 2009.</p>
<p>Well, not exactly by herself. From Cash’s album, <em>The List, </em>here’s “Sea of Heartbreak” with Bruce Springsteen.</p>

<p>Rosanne and Bruce performed “Sea of Heartbreak” together just once, at Rosanne’s show in Durham, North Carolina in 2010. No recording circulates from that performance.</p>
