If only Johnny Cash had released it as a single when he recorded it for his 1996 *Unchained* album, "Sea of Heartbreak" might have charted for *four* consecutive decades.

He didn't though, and the streak ended. But that didn't stop Cash's daughter Rosanne from taking a run at it herself in 2009.

Well, not exactly by herself. From Cash's album, *The List,* here's "Sea of Heartbreak" with Bruce Springsteen.
