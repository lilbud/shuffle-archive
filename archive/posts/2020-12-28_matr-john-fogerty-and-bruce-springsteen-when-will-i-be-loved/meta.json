So much so, in fact, that he released his first solo album under the name The Blue Ridge Rangers.</p>\n<p>Fogerty&#8217;s name didn&#8217;t even appear on the cover of the album, and none of his songwriting appeared on it either. <em>The Blue Ridge Rangers</em>\u00a0 was a covers album, and it was truly a solo project&#8211;Fogerty played every instrument on the album.</p>\n<p>Thirty-five years later, Fogery&#8217;s wife Julie suggested he make a sequel. John took his wife&#8217;s advice and recorded\u00a0<em>The Blue Ridge Rangers Rides Again\u00a0</em>(the bad grammar an intentional in-joke since The Blue Ridge Rangers was a one-man band).\u00a0This time, though, John had a backing band in the studio.</p>\n<p>Like the original, the sequel was also comprised entirely of covers, the last of which was The Everly Brothers&#8217; &#8220;When Will I Be Loved.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Everly Brothers &quot;When Will I Be Loved&quot;\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rI0ll5SexV0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>The Everly Brothers took &#8220;When Will I Be Loved&#8221; to #8 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the summer of 1960, and Fogerty vividly remembers the first time he heard it.</p>\n<div id=\"v-2o54avrw-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='568' src='https://videopress.com/embed/2o54avrw?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>In 1975, Linda Ronstadt scored even higher chart success with &#8220;When Will I Be Loved&#8221; when she took it it all the way to #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #1 on the Billboard Country &amp; Western charts.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"When Will I Be Loved\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/r4TdEG2drsU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>When John decided to include &#8220;When Will I Be Loved&#8221; on his new Blue Ridge Rangers album, his wife offered him one piece of wise advice:</p>\n<div id=\"v-WQyPeOXM-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='568' src='https://videopress.com/embed/WQyPeOXM?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>John and his backing band recorded the basic tracks in October 2008, but John held off on the vocals, hoping he&#8217;d be able to secure Bruce&#8217;s participation. It was Julie who broached the subject with Bruce, who immediately agreed to do it.</p>\n<p>John and Julie flew to New Jersey shortly in the early days of 2009, and somehow during a chain of events that included Bruce accepting a Golden Globe award for &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/10/31/roll-of-the-dice-the-wrestler/\">The Wrestler</a>,&#8221; performing &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/11/21/roll-of-the-dice-the-rising/\">The Rising</a>&#8221; at the inauguration of President Obama, releasing a new album, and playing the Super Bowl half-time show, Bruce found time to record duet vocals with John for &#8220;When Will I Be Loved&#8221; at his home in Colts Neck.</p>\n<p>Bruce&#8217;s vocals are unmistakable on the track. John let him fly solo on a verse, but the high key of the chorus proved a challenge for Bruce&#8217;s range.\u00a0 As John remarked in an interview, however, &#8220;He got it done. He didn&#8217;t complain; he didn&#8217;t wimp out. It sounds great. It was remarkable how much of a chance he would take.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;When Will I Be Loved&#8221; ended up as the closing track on\u00a0<em>The Blue Ridge Rangers Rides Again</em>, as well as its first single, released in early August of 2009.</p>\n<p>When it came time to film an official video for the new single, Bruce was touring the world in support of <em>Working on a Dream.\u00a0</em>Still, he managed to make a brief cameo appearance in the video&#8211;see if you can spot him.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"John Fogerty and Bruce Springsteen: &quot;When Will I Be Loved&quot;\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fpeaMoCWNNg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><strong>When Will I Be Loved<br />\nRecorded:</strong> October 2008 &#8211; January 2009<br />\n<strong>Released:\u00a0</strong><em>The Blue Ridge Rangers Rides Again</em><br />\n<strong>Never performed</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>When John Fogerty decided to record a sequel to his 1973 debut album, Bruce decided it was finally time to join his friend in the studio.</p>\n", "protected": false}, "author": 1, "featured_media": 24193, "comment_status": "open", "ping_status": "open", "sticky": false, "template": "", "format": "standard", "meta": {"_monsterinsights_skip_tracking": false, "_monsterinsights_sitenote_active": false, "_monsterinsights_sitenote_note": "", "_monsterinsights_sitenote_category": 0, "jetpack_post_was_ever_published": false, "_jetpack_newsletter_access": "", "_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs": false, "_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id": 0, "_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content": false, "_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content": false, "footnotes": "", "jetpack_publicize_message": "", "jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled": true, "jetpack_social_post_already_shared": true, "jetpack_social_options": {"image_generator_settings": {"template": "highway", "default_image_id": 0, "font": "", "enabled": false}, "version": 2}}, "categories": [4, 5], "tags": [694, 3035, 2141, 3033], "class_list": ["post-23944", "post", "type-post", "status-publish", "format-standard", "has-post-thumbnail", "hentry", "category-cover-me", "category-meeting-across-the-river", "tag-john-fogerty", "tag-the-blue-ridge-rangers-rides-again", "tag-the-everly-brothers", "tag-when-will-i-be-loved"], "aioseo_notices": [], "jetpack_publicize_connections": [], "jetpack_featured_media_url": "https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/whenwillibeloved.jpg?fit=500%2C500&ssl=1", "jetpack_sharing_enabled": true, "jetpack_shortlink": "https://wp.me/p9w3Lk-6ec", "jetpack_likes_enabled": true, "jetpack-related-posts": [{"id": 19493, "url": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/07/11/matr-john-fogerty-and-bruce-springsteen-deja-vu-all-over-again/", "url_meta": {"origin": 23944, "position": 0}, "title": "MatR: John Fogerty and Bruce Springsteen: Deja Vu (All Over Again)", "author": "Ken", "date": "July 11, 2020", "format": false, "excerpt": "When America found itself enmeshed in an unpopular foreign war (again), John Fogerty met the moment.
