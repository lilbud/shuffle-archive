<p>Apparently #42 on the Billboard Hot 100 was high enough to catch the attention of a young Bruce Springsteen, however, because the following year, “Only You Know and I Know” turned up on the setlist of The Bruce Springsteen Band” during their residency at the Student Prince in Asbury Park.</p>
<p>Here’s their only known and captured performance (featuring an extended guitar jam almost as long as the original single) from the evening of December 11, 1971.</p>
