“Only You Know and I Know” was Dave Mason’s first single to chart, stopping just shy of the Top 40 upon its release in the summer of 1970.

Apparently #42 on the Billboard Hot 100 was high enough to catch the attention of a young Bruce Springsteen, however, because the following year, “Only You Know and I Know” turned up on the setlist of The Bruce Springsteen Band” during their residency at the Student Prince in Asbury Park.

Here’s their only known and captured performance (featuring an extended guitar jam almost as long as the original single) from the evening of December 11, 1971.
