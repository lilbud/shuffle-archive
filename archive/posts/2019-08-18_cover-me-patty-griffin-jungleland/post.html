<p>Patty Griffin has nothing if not guts.</p>
<p>Earlier this year in Philadelphia, on her first U.S. tour since defeating breast cancer, she stepped up to the microphone and opened her show with a most unexpected song choice. There are a few videos floating around of it, but the fact that they all seem to miss the opening bars of the introduction show just how off-guard the audience must have been caught.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJMq8_q7K28">Watch on Youtube: Patty Griffin - "Jungleland" (Bruce Springsteen cover) - 4/04/19 - Philadelphia, PA</a></p>
<p>Patty’s cover is brave, but more than that: it’s beautiful, capturing the essence of Bruce’s street war ballad in quiet contemplation. Even the guitar solo works, and in the moments leading up to it, I couldn’t imagine how it possibly would.</p>
<p>As far as I know, Patty only performed “Jungleland” one other time, in New York just two days later. That’s too bad–this is one cover I’d very much like to hear live.</p>
