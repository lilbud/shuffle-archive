**1976:** Bruce drops by The Hanger in Hazlet, New Jersey, to see Gary U.S. Bonds perform–unknown to Gary. Mid-show, the owner whispers to Gary that Bruce is in the audience and is interested in joining him on stage. Gary has no idea who Bruce is, but his band does and they encourage Bonds to say yes. He does, and Bruce and Gary meet for the first time. Bruce borrows a guitar and plays with Bonds and the band for about an hour, and afterwards Bruce invites Gary to join him at his show at the Palladium the following week.
