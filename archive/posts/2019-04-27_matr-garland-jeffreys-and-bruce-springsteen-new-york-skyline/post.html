By that winter, Bruce had asked his friend and contemporary to join him on stage in Asbury Park at Bruce’s annual holiday concerts.</p>
<p>Among the songs Garland and Bruce performed together that night: Garland’s love song to his hometown, “New York Skyline,” from his 1977 album <em>Ghost Writer.</em></p>

<p>Garland’s version on that December night was even more tender and contemplative than his original version above, perhaps a bit too much so for the festive crowd–during the song’s quieter moments, you can hear them Brooooce-ing, unfortunately. (Bruce heard them too, as you’ll discover toward the end of the track.)</p>
<p>So ignore the boorish fans and give a listen to the beautiful performance below–Garland is on lead vocals, but Bruce provides backing vocals and guitar.</p>
