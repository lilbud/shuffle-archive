Oklahoma singer-songwriter Jimmy LaFave has a talent for interpreting Bruce's songs (see his cover of "[Valentine's Day](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/03/03/cover-me-jimmy-lafave-valentines-day/)").

In 2012, Jimmy released his album *Depending on the Distance*, featuring his cover of Bruce's "[Land of Hope and Dreams.](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/01/05/roll-of-the-dice-land-of-hope-and-dreams/)" Unlike Bruce's version, which plays more like a declarative anthem, Jimmy's version is tender–almost a love song. It's a different take, and a great cover.
