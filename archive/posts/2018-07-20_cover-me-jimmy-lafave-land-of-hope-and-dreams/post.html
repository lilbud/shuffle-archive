<p>Oklahoma singer-songwriter Jimmy LaFave has a talent for interpreting Bruce’s songs (see his cover of “<a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/03/03/cover-me-jimmy-lafave-valentines-day/">Valentine’s Day</a>“).</p>
<p>In 2012, Jimmy released his album <em>Depending on the Distance</em>, featuring his cover of Bruce’s “<a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/01/05/roll-of-the-dice-land-of-hope-and-dreams/">Land of Hope and Dreams.</a>” Unlike Bruce’s version, which plays more like a declarative anthem, Jimmy’s version is tender–almost a love song. It’s a different take, and a great cover.</p>
