Here’s a switch: a Roy Orbison song that Bruce actually covered *before* Orbison released it.

“(All I Can Do Is) Dream You” was written for Orbison by Billy Burnette (son of rockabilly legend Johnny Burnette). Roy recorded and released it on his posthumous 1989 album, *Mystery Girl*. With its aching, heart-breaking lyrics and soaring melody, it was tailor-made for him.

We didn’t get to hear Roy’s studio version of “(All I Can Do Is) Dream You” until after he was gone, but we at least got to hear him perform it live.

During his legendary *Black and White Night* all-star concert in 1987, “(All I Can Do Is) Dream You” was on the set list, and Bruce was in the band.

Orbison was one of Bruce’s heroes, and throughout the show, Bruce was clearly in awe of Roy’s legendary voice.

Unfortunately, Bruce wasn’t center stage for this song, though–to spot him, you’ll have to keep your eyes to Roy’s left and wait for the camera to pan–but the camera gets a good close up of him at around the 2:25 mark, and his guitar is present throughout.

**Bonus:** After the show ended that night, Roy brought the band back to the stage to film a five-song mini “secret concert,” and “(All I Can Do Is) Dream You” was on the set list for that one too. This is a completely different performance than the one above, seen by far fewer people. Enjoy,.
