<p>Here’s a switch: a Roy Orbison song that Bruce actually covered <em>before</em> Orbison released it.</p>
<p>“(All I Can Do Is) Dream You” was written for Orbison by Billy Burnette (son of rockabilly legend Johnny Burnette). Roy recorded and released it on his posthumous 1989 album, <em>Mystery Girl</em>. With its aching, heart-breaking lyrics and soaring melody, it was tailor-made for him.</p>

<p>We didn’t get to hear Roy’s studio version of “(All I Can Do Is) Dream You” until after he was gone, but we at least got to hear him perform it live.</p>
<p>During his legendary <em>Black and White Night</em> all-star concert in 1987, “(All I Can Do Is) Dream You” was on the set list, and Bruce was in the band.</p>
<p>Orbison was one of Bruce’s heroes, and throughout the show, Bruce was clearly in awe of Roy’s legendary voice.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Bruce wasn’t center stage for this song, though–to spot him, you’ll have to keep your eyes to Roy’s left and wait for the camera to pan–but the camera gets a good close up of him at around the 2:25 mark, and his guitar is present throughout.</p>

<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> After the show ended that night, Roy brought the band back to the stage to film a five-song mini “secret concert,” and “(All I Can Do Is) Dream You” was on the set list for that one too. This is a completely different performance than the one above, seen by far fewer people. Enjoy,.</p>
