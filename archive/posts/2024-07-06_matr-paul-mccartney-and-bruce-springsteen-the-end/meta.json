The Beatles hadn&#8217;t intended for &#8220;The End&#8221; to close out the album (let alone their career) at the time they recorded it, and by all accounts Paul was simply looking for a satisfying way to cap off the medley. He took his inspiration from The Bard, who liked to close his plays with a standalone couplet.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The End&#8221; comes at, well, the end of a sixteen-minute medley of short or incomplete Lennon-McCartney songs that never made it to vinyl in final form.</p>\n<p>Bookended by brief lyrical snippets, the track is essentially an instrumental jam, with Paul, John, and George trading off three rounds of two-bar guitar solos and featuring Ringo&#8217;s only drum solo on a Beatles track.</p>\n<p>The guitar jam is the track&#8217;s highlight. Even without reading interviews confirming it, we can hear the infectious abandon and friendly competition between the three guitar-wielding Beatles.</p>\n<p>It puts aspiring artists on notice: if you&#8217;re going to perform &#8220;The End&#8221; live in concert, you better have three hot-shot guitarists on hand to do it justice.</p>\n<p>Even if you&#8217;re Paul McCartney.</p>\n<p>Luckily for Sir Paul, when he was asked to close out the 54th Annual Grammy Awards in 2012 with &#8220;The End,&#8221; he had an array of stellar guitar talent on hand to choose from.</p>\n<p>In the end, he had\u00a0<em>six</em> guitar heroes on stage: besides himself and his two outstanding touring guitarists Rusty Anderson and Brian Ray, McCartney invited Dave Grohl, Joe Walsh, and Bruce Springsteen to join the epic televised jam.</p>\n<p>Bruce easily held his own against that formidable line-up, and in the clip below we can clearly see him having the time of his life.</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"VideoPress Video Player\" aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='426' src='https://videopress.com/embed/0ABz94N6?at=216&amp;hd=0&amp;cover=1' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script src='https://v0.wordpress.com/js/next/videopress-iframe.js?m=1674852142'></script></p>\n<p>For a kid who grew up idolizing The Beatles, the chance to support McCartney on stage like that even once would be a bucket list dream.</p>\n<p>A decade later, however, Springsteen had the chance to do it again. Twice.</p>\n<p>Bruce had already been on stage for a couple of songs (including his own &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2024/06/04/roll-of-the-dice-glory-days/\">Glory Days</a>&#8220;) earlier in the set at McCartney&#8217;s 80th birthday show at MetLife Stadium in 2022. He came back out for the final encore, joining McCartney, Anderson and Ray for the show-closing &#8220;The End.&#8221;</p>\n<p>With only four guitarists at the fore for an extra-long jam, Bruce had even more at-bats than he did at The Grammys, and the hometown crowd went wild for it.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"&quot;The End (Jam) &quot; Paul McCartney &amp; Bruce Springsteen@Metlife East Rutherford, NJ 6/16/22\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/whSVXfetz4g?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Just nine days later, Bruce reprised his guest appearance at McCartney&#8217;s headlining gig across the pond at Glastonbury.</p>\n<p>That appearance was actually a promise kept: McCartney had asked Bruce to join him for the gig two years earlier&#8230; in 2020.</p>\n<p>Springsteen agreed, but a global pandemic forced the festival to punt the gig two years down the road. Bruce remembered his promise, however, and showed up for his songwriting idol.
