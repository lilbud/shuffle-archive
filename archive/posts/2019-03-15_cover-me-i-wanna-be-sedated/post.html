<p>Whew. Okay, now we can proceed.</p>
<p>“I Wanna Be Sedated” is one of those songs that will absolutely stop me in the tracks of whatever I was doing at the time so I can dance with abandon around the house singing “ba ba baba, baba ba baba…” Who doesn’t love to do that?</p>
<p>Apparently Bruce does, because he didn’t hesitate to grab the sign request for The Ramones’ classic crowd-pleaser when a fan raised it at Bruce’s second show in Boston on the Working on a Dream Tour.</p>
<p>After taking a moment or ten to work out the song with the band, they barrel-rolled through it, as loose and woolly as the song deserves. Take a listen:</p>

<p>(Oh, and a fun fact about that brilliant video at the top of the post: that’s a very young Courtney Love playing the role of the bride.)</p>
<p>A true one-off performance, that was–Bruce has never played “I Wanna Be Sedated” before or since.</p>
