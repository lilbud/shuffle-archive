Manfred Mann's cover of "[Blinded by the Light](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2023/01/01/roll-of-the-dice-blinded-by-the-light/)" is one of the most famous Springsteen covers out there–it gets lots of airplay to this day.

But "Blinded" isn't the only Springsteen original covered by Mann and his band. Here's a vintage video of them taking on "[For You](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/01/08/roll-of-the-dice-for-you/)" on their 1980 album, *Chance.* By 1980, they had lots of Springsteen songs to choose from, so I think it's interesting that for all three covers, they drew from Bruce's very first album.

Love them or hate them, they definitely put their own spin on Bruce's material.
