<p>Manfred Mann’s cover of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2023/01/01/roll-of-the-dice-blinded-by-the-light/">Blinded by the Light</a>” is one of the most famous Springsteen covers out there–it gets lots of airplay to this day.</p>
<p>But “Blinded” isn’t the only Springsteen original covered by Mann and his band. Here’s a vintage video of them taking on “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/01/08/roll-of-the-dice-for-you/">For You</a>” on their 1980 album, <em>Chance.</em> By 1980, they had lots of Springsteen songs to choose from, so I think it’s interesting that for all three covers, they drew from Bruce’s very first album.</p>
<p>Love them or hate them, they definitely put their own spin on Bruce’s material.</p>
