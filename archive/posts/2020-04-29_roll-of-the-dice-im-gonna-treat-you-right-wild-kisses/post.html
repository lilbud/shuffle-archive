<p>My goodness, where did <em>this </em>come from? And where did it go?</p>

<p>Other than this maddeningly unclear tape of a Darkness Tour rehearsal from late 1978, we have no record of “I’m Gonna Treat You Right” (also known by bootleggers as “Wild Kisses”).</p>
<p>Bruce doesn’t appear to have ever recorded it either in the studio or as a home demo, he’s never played it on tour, and we’ve never seen a scrap of handwritten lyrics.</p>
<p>And yet, “I’m Gonna Treat You Right” is almost certainly a Springsteen original, one with a ton of light-hearted potential.</p>
<p>We can understand enough of the lyrics to understand why it was left off of <em>Darkness on the Edge of Town</em>–it certainly wouldn’t have fit the serious tone of that album.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Hey mister, you see that girl walking down the street</em><br/>
<em>That little girl, she used to turn’ em on</em><br/>
<em>Wild kisses and a heart that’s oh-so-sweet</em><br/>
<em>??? in the middle of the night</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>And now, wild kisses never seem to settle down</em><br/>
<em>Afraid to get my feet back on the ground</em><br/>
<em>Well baby ???</em><br/>
<em>I’m gonna meet her tonight</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>And now my wild world’s tumblin’ and dancin’</em><br/>
<em>I’m looking for true romancin’</em></p>
<p>But it would have been perfectly suited for <em>The River, </em>and a brilliant live addition to the Darkness Tour. Bruce is clearly getting his Buddy Holly on in that rehearsal tape, and with a little polish, “I’m Gonna Treat You Right” would have made a great pairing or alternate for Bruce’s cover of Holly’s “<a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/03/25/matr-bruce-springsteen-and-gary-busey-rave-on/">Rave On</a>” that frequently graced Bruce’s 1978 set lists.</p>
<p>Alas, “I’m Gonna Treat You Right” appears to be lost to history; it doesn’t look like it ever even made it to the vault.</p>
<p>It sure would be a nice surprise for <em>Tracks II</em>, though.</p>
