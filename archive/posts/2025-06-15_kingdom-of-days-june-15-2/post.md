***New for 2025:** New entry for 1979*

**1973:** At Madison Square Garden, Bruce and his band play their thirteenth and final show as the opening act for Chicago. This was a notoriously bad tour for the band, playing to huge but unreceptive (and sometimes booing) crowds. Bruce resolves never to play big halls again, and he sticks to it… for a while.

**1974:** Under record label pressure to release a new single, Bruce and the E Street Band cancel a show at Armadillo World Headquarters in Austin.
