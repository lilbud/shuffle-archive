<p>Earlier this week, I published my <em>Roll of the Dice </em>article on “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/01/13/roll-of-the-dice-cover-me/">Cover Me</a>” and proclaimed it my least favorite Springsteen song ever.</p>
<p>I wasn’t particularly generous in my review, but in all fairness I did caveat: “There’s an argument to be made for ‘Cover Me’ being a decent pop song if only it was set to a different backing track and arrangement.”</p>
<p>Well, J.D. Desharnais of the New York City band 13th Alibi certainly set me straight on that.</p>
<p>J.D. saw my post on a Springsteen-related Facebook group and directed me to his band’s smoking 2013 performance of “Cover Me,” featuring guest vocalist DiLiA.</p>
<p>Trust me: even if you hate “Cover Me”–<em>especially</em> if you hate it, in fact–you need to watch this. Imagine “Cover Me” arranged like “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/10/04/roll-of-the-dice-the-fever/">The Fever</a>,” and that’s what you’re about to hear.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDxtlX5xFwg">Watch on Youtube: Bruce Springsteen - "Cover Me" performed by DiLiA* &amp; 13th Alibi</a></p>
<p>DiLiA and 13th Alibi recognized the sultry, sensual heat at the heart of “Cover Me,” and they zeroed right in on it.</p>
<p>Their performance is fantastic, and it’s enough to make me reconsider my opinion of the song. I now rank it <em>above</em> “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/08/09/roll-of-the-dice-ill-stand-by-you-always/">I’ll Stand By You</a>.”</p>
<p>(There ain’t no saving <em>that </em>song. Prove me wrong, please.)</p>
<p>Thanks, J.D.!</p>
