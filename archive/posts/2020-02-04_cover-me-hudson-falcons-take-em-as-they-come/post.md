Take Bruce’s 1980 power pop outtake, pass directly through garage rock, and stop just an inch shy of punk, and what do you get?

You get this fantastic cover of “[Take ‘Em as They Come](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/03/29/roll-of-the-dice-take-em-as-they-come/)” from New Jersey legends the Hudson Falcons. Take a listen, but first turn the volume up *loud.*

This isn’t the only time the Falcons have covered Bruce (check out [their thrash cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMXKBzUN6Tc) of “[Open All Night](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/10/28/roll-of-the-dice-open-all-night/)“)–but it’s arguably their most successful attempt at blending the spirit of the original with their own sound.

It’s a great rendition of a vastly underappreciated song.
