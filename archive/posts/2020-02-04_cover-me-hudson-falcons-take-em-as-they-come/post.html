<p>Take Bruce’s 1980 power pop outtake, pass directly through garage rock, and stop just an inch shy of punk, and what do you get?</p>
<p>You get this fantastic cover of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/03/29/roll-of-the-dice-take-em-as-they-come/">Take ‘Em as They Come</a>” from New Jersey legends the Hudson Falcons. Take a listen, but first turn the volume up <em>loud.</em></p>

<p>This isn’t the only time the Falcons have covered Bruce (check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMXKBzUN6Tc">their thrash cover</a> of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/10/28/roll-of-the-dice-open-all-night/">Open All Night</a>“)–but it’s arguably their most successful attempt at blending the spirit of the original with their own sound.</p>
<p>It’s a great rendition of a vastly underappreciated song.</p>
