<p>Fellow New Jerseyans  take a swing at Bruce’s “<a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/01/22/roll-of-the-dice-downbound-train/">Downbound Train</a>.”</p>
<p>There’s nothing new here arrangement-wise, but they do an admirable job with it. They also have the benefit of distance from the 1980s; it’s nice to hear a studio version of “Downbound Train” with the synth dialed back!</p>
