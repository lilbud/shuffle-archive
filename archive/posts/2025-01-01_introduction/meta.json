        "rendered": "<p><i>Kingdom of Days</i> was never supposed to be a book, let alone a twelve-volume series.</p>\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t supposed to go viral on social media, or get read aloud daily on satellite radio.</p>\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t supposed to run for more than a year, and it certainly wasn&#8217;t meant to outlast everything else on the blog.</p>\n<p>When I started\u00a0<em>E Street Shuffle</em> in January 2018, I wanted it to be about the songs. The blog derives its name from my original conceit for it: an unpredictable series of deep-dives on songs Bruce Springsteen had in some way touched.</p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t set out to publish an essay every day&#8211;that just sort of happened. I think I was a week or two in when I realized I had yet to take a break. I was flush with ideas and enthusiasm, and in those days words poured out of me at a speed and with an ease that I long for now.</p>\n<p>So in the belief that I couldn&#8217;t sustain a daily pace, I decided I needed\u00a0<em>something</em> to post each day. (I had consulted with experienced bloggers who impressed upon me the need to feed the beast daily lest your readers forget you.)</p>\n<p>I also knew I wanted a way to organize all my media links, newspaper scans, personal concert reviews, and such. The fan community already had the long-lived, meticulous, invaluable Brucebase, but at the time I found it unwieldy to navigate and search, and I was too shy to contact the admins to share my personal research discoveries.</p>\n<p>Out of that convergence of needs,\u00a0<em>Kingdom of Days</em> was born. Relying heavily on Brucebase, I supplemented with personal newspaper and magazine scans and copious YouTube videos.</p>\n<p>I thought it would run for a year. But at the end of Year One, I realized how easy it would be to update and repost the articles, so I kept it going.</p>\n<p>By Year Two, I had started doing deep daily research and had purchased subscriptions to several newspaper archives. I found myself unearthing evidence of unknown shows along with articles about what Bruce and the band did during off-days between shows.</p>\n<p>I discovered that there were a ton of articles out there that I had missed because in the early days, there was no Internet to spell-check a performer&#8217;s name. I started searching for Bruce &#8220;Springstein,&#8221; &#8220;Springstien,&#8221; and &#8220;Springfield&#8221; and uncovered a trove of new concert reviews and advertisements.</p>\n<p>I searched for album advertisements and contemporaneous TV and newspaper interviews with fans lining up to buy newly released albums and discovered that most of the &#8220;official&#8221; album release dates on Wikipedia and Bruce&#8217;s own website were off by days, weeks, or in a couple of cases months.</p>\n<p>Gradually, and almost resentfully, I found myself becoming increasingly committed to\u00a0<em>Kingdom of Days.\u00a0</em>With each new year, I challenged myself to find new information to add each day.</p>\n<p>And then there was the day, driving home from vacation on the Oregon coast, that I made my wife pull over to the roadside so I could verify what I was hearing: a satellite radio DJ reading my words! Although my daily readership already averaged in the mid-to-high four digits, that was the moment I realized\u00a0<em>Kingdom of Days</em> had taken on a life of its own. I am forever grateful to Jim Rotolo and the E Street Radio staff for the daily acknowledgement.</p>\n<p>Even though in my mind, <em>Roll of the Dice</em> was the star of the site, people started referring to the blog as <em>Kingdom of Days</em> instead of <em>E Street Shuffle</em>. I&#8217;d often downplay\u00a0<em>Kingdom</em> when asked about the blog, but eventually the conversation would come back to it. <i>Kingdom </i>is what kept readers coming back each day, even when the song of the day was an obscure outtake that I&#8217;m sure no one but me cared about.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve long since given up trying to keep\u00a0<em>Kingdom</em> at arm&#8217;s length. I&#8217;m proud of the historical archive it became, grateful for the many photo, newspaper, audio, video, and I-was-there accounts contributed by fellow fans over the years (some of whom have forever sworn me to secrecy, or I would acknowledge them in these pages). Several previously unreleased songs, performances, and videos made their way into the E Street Nation community via <em>Kingdom of Days</em>.</p>\n<p>And while I&#8217;m expressing gratitude, if the pages that follow are typo-free, that&#8217;s thanks to Lori Pierce, whose eagle eye catches (I hope and trust) every typo in blog post. (I didn&#8217;t run this introduction by her, though, so any typos here are all on me.)</p>\n<p>Thank you also to the Brucebase team, the foundation for any historical Springsteen undertaking. You guys do yeoman&#8217;s work, and it is appreciated.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve tried my best to credit photographers where I&#8217;m able to. Some come via bootleg CD artwork or Brucebase, where I&#8217;ve been unable to identify the original source. If you recognize your uncredited work, I apologize&#8211;please contact me and I will update the blog (or remove it if you prefer).</p>\n<p>For years, I couldn&#8217;t imagine how\u00a0<em>Kingdom of Days</em> could possibly work in print. Every day&#8217;s post was chock full of media, and I didn&#8217;t know how to replicate the blog experience in book form.</p>\n<p>As it turned out, I didn&#8217;t need to. With some light editing, pruning, and layout magic,\u00a0<em>Kingdom of Days</em> is transformed into a living scrapbook, punctuated with scannable QR codes \u00a0that will transport you back in time to&#8230; well, wherever Bruce Springsteen was on that day in history.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll need your camera-equipped mobile device to bring each page to life, but in my opinion the newspaper reviews work much better on the printed page than they do on your device.</p>\n<p>(Note: The video and audio links are hosted by a variety of channels and posters, so I can\u2019t guarantee that every QR code will work as time goes on. In fact, I pretty much\u00a0<em>can</em> guarantee that someday they won\u2019t. Every year, I\u2019ve had to repair around ten percent of the links, so that\u2019s probably a pretty good benchmark for the \u201cQR decay\u201d over time. I hope you\u2019re able to enjoy the full experience now, and that the book holds up as good reading even when the media someday expires.)</p>\n<p>As reluctant as I was to even consider it, I think <em>Kingdom of Days\u00a0</em>works pretty darn well as a monthly almanac.</p>\n<p>I hope you think so, too, and I hope you enjoy this road trip through Januaries past. See you next month in Volume 2.</p>\n",
