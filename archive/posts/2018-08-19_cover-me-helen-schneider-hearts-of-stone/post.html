<p>Schneider may live and work in Germany, but she’s got New Jersey bonafides: she grew up in North Jersey, and her only American cinema credit was a memorable one–she played Joann Carlino in the classic <em>Eddie and the Cruisers, </em>which is pretty much a feature-length love note to the Jersey shore sound. (Never saw it? Go find it, and thank me later.)</p>
<p>And then there’s her cover of Bruce’s “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/09/07/roll-of-the-dice-hearts-of-stone/">Hearts of Stone</a>.” It’s not the most interesting of videos to watch (it was 1980, after all, still pre-MTV), but she certainly commits to the song.</p>
