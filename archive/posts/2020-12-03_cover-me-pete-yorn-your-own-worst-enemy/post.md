meta-description: One of the best yet least-performed tracks on Magic gets some love from Pete Yorn, although I’m not sure he fully groks it.

Ten points to Pete Yorn for choosing one of the best tracks (but least played) from Bruce’s album: “”

*Magic* [Your Own Worst Enemy.](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/05/31/roll-of-the-dice-your-own-worst-enemy/)

Another 10 points for his beautiful guitar work and deeply felt vocals.

Minus 5 for not understanding the song.

Still a great cover, though.
