So this is a thing: Iconic TV stars from the 1970s covering songs by Bruce Springsteen. Sure, it’s a micro-genre, but a surprisingly well-represented one.

So far on the Shuffle, we’ve featured Tom “Luke Duke” Wopat’s of “” and Suzi “Leather Tuscadero” Quatro’s of “Born to Run.”

Here’s installment #3: Lynda “Wonder Woman” Carter’s gentle country arrangement of “.”

Can’t say I’m a fan of this particular arrangement–I think it entirely loses the heat at the heart of the song–but it’s a valiant attempt, and hey, it’s Wonder Woman.

Bonus: here’s a snippet of Lynda performing the song live. It’s only a minute, but it’s the only clip I could find.
