At the same time &#8220;River Deep &#8211; Mountain High&#8221; barely clawed its way into the Billboard Hot 100, The Walker Brothers&#8217; Spector-ian cover of &#8220;The Sun Ain&#8217;t Gonna Shine Anymore&#8221; soared past it to peak at #13 in the U.S. and #1 in the U.K.</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cr-ExoAmPns</p>\n<p>The Walkers&#8217; version of &#8220;The Sun Ain&#8217;t Gonna Shine Anymore&#8221; is easily a candidate for the most magnificent wall-of-sound production and stands shoulder to shoulder with Spector&#8217;s best tracks. It&#8217;s no wonder that Bruce Springsteen was drawn to it.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s actually a cover, though: Frankie Valli recorded the original a year earlier in a slower, statelier, but still lush arrangement that failed to chart.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"The Sun Ain&#039;t Gonna Shine (Anymore)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qHw8f_B2bVM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Valli&#8217;s original flew so under the radar that even Springsteen was unaware of it when he decided to record his own version for his 2022 vocal-centric album, <em>Only the Strong Survive. </em>Although Valli is certainly no slouch in the singing department, Bruce was captivated by Scott Walker&#8217;s rich Orbisonian baritone that reminded him of his early work.</p>\n<p>&#8220;[T]here was an operatic part of my voice that I used on\u00a0<em>Born To Run</em>\u00a0and a little bit on\u00a0<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/07/05/album-companion-darkness-on-the-edge-of-town/\"><em>Darkness</em></a>,&#8221; he told\u00a0<em>Rolling Stone&#8217;s</em> Andy Greene, &#8220;but then I put it away and just sang with more of a barman\u2019s rock voice for the rest of my work life, for the most part. But on that song, I was able to bring it back again and really sing in that big, round tone that I love to use. &#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - The Sun Ain&#039;t Gonna Shine Anymore (Official Audio)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/B3ugToQv0c4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Did he ever. Bruce delivers what is easily the standout vocal performance on an album built around them. There&#8217;s not a hint of his trademark gruff or growl. This is Bruce in full croon, in a track that sounds like it belongs more on <em>Western Stars\u00a0</em>than\u00a0<em>Only the Strong Survive.</em></p>\n<p>It also features one of the strongest arrangements on the album, clearly following The Walker Brothers&#8217; blueprint but with an expanded soundstage and an orchestral majesty befitting such a thrilling track.</p>\n<p>It may &#8220;only&#8221; be a cover (and a safe one at that), but &#8220;The Sun Ain&#8217;t Gonna Shine&#8221; easily ranks among Springsteen&#8217;s finest vocal moments on record.</p>\n<p><strong>The Sun Ain&#8217;t Gonna Shine Anymore<br />\nRecorded:\u00a0</strong>2021<br />\n<strong>Released:\u00a0</strong><em>Only the Strong Survive </em><em>(2022)<br />\n</em><strong>Never performed</strong></p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
