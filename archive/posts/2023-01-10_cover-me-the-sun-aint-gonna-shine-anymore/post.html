<p>When “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/02/18/matr-tina-turner-bruce-springsteen-little-richard-stevie-wonder-and-more-river-deep-mountain-high/">River Deep – Mountain High</a>” tanked in early 1966, Phil Spector retreated (temporarily) from the music industry, and with him went his signature “wall of sound.”</p>
<p>Well… not entirely. At the same time “River Deep – Mountain High” barely clawed its way into the Billboard Hot 100, The Walker Brothers’ Spector-ian cover of “The Sun Ain’t Gonna Shine Anymore” soared past it to peak at #13 in the U.S. and #1 in the U.K.</p>

<p>The Walkers’ version of “The Sun Ain’t Gonna Shine Anymore” is easily a candidate for the most magnificent wall-of-sound production and stands shoulder to shoulder with Spector’s best tracks. It’s no wonder that Bruce Springsteen was drawn to it.</p>
<p>It’s actually a cover, though: Frankie Valli recorded the original a year earlier in a slower, statelier, but still lush arrangement that failed to chart.</p>

<p>Valli’s original flew so under the radar that even Springsteen was unaware of it when he decided to record his own version for his 2022 vocal-centric album, <em>Only the Strong Survive. </em>Although Valli is certainly no slouch in the singing department, Bruce was captivated by Scott Walker’s rich Orbisonian baritone that reminded him of his early work.</p>
<p>“[T]here was an operatic part of my voice that I used on <em>Born To Run</em> and a little bit on <a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/07/05/album-companion-darkness-on-the-edge-of-town/"><em>Darkness</em></a>,” he told <em>Rolling Stone’s</em> Andy Greene, “but then I put it away and just sang with more of a barman’s rock voice for the rest of my work life, for the most part. But on that song, I was able to bring it back again and really sing in that big, round tone that I love to use. ”</p>

<p>Did he ever. Bruce delivers what is easily the standout vocal performance on an album built around them. There’s not a hint of his trademark gruff or growl. This is Bruce in full croon, in a track that sounds like it belongs more on <em>Western Stars </em>than <em>Only the Strong Survive.</em></p>
<p>It also features one of the strongest arrangements on the album, clearly following The Walker Brothers’ blueprint but with an expanded soundstage and an orchestral majesty befitting such a thrilling track.</p>
<p>It may “only” be a cover (and a safe one at that), but “The Sun Ain’t Gonna Shine” easily ranks among Springsteen’s finest vocal moments on record.</p>
