In 2003, songwriters Kevin Bowe and Todd Cerney wrote "The Blues Is My Business" for Etta James' Grammy-winning blues album, *Let's Roll.*

The song certainly caught Little Steven's attention–he covered it for his latest album, *Soulfire,* and he's been performing it all throughout his latest tour.

Shortly before the album was released, Steve, Bruce, Southside and a host of other assembled artists united on-stage at the Paramount Theater during the Asbury Park Music and Film Festival, forming a one-night-only ensemble called the Upstage Jam Band in honor of the legendary club.

The first song Bruce, Steve, and co. played together? "The Blues is My Business," and it remains the only time Bruce has performed the song to date.
