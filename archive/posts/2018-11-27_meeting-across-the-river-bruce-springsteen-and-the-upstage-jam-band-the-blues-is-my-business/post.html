<p>The song certainly caught Little Steven’s attention–he covered it for his latest album, <em>Soulfire, </em>and he’s been performing it all throughout his latest tour.</p>

<p>Shortly before the album was released, Steve, Bruce, Southside and a host of other assembled artists united on-stage at the Paramount Theater during the Asbury Park Music and Film Festival, forming a one-night-only ensemble called the Upstage Jam Band in honor of the legendary club.</p>
<p>The first song Bruce, Steve, and co. played together? “The Blues is My Business,” and it remains the only time Bruce has performed the song to date.</p>
