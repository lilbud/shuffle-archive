Like much of his early Steel Mill work, Bruce seems to have intended &#8220;I Can&#8217;t Take It No More&#8221; primarily as a guitar showcase.</p>\n<p>If considered instrumentally, it&#8217;s a pretty decent hard rock song for a barely 21-year-old songwriter. The song simmers at a slow burn, building in intensity through the first jam break, until it finally explodes after the bridge.</p>\n<p>Vocally, too, the &#8220;I Can&#8217;t Take It No More&#8221; features fine shared vocals from Bruce and Robbin Thompson (until Robbin&#8217;s shockingly ferocious lead drowns Bruce out just before the second instrumental break).</p>\n<p>But lyrically, the song is essentially just a guy demanding more &#8220;respect&#8221; from his girl.</p>\n<p>Or at least, that&#8217;s the generous interpretation. More likely, the narrator is projecting his own frustrations onto his girlfriend rather than facing them himself&#8211;and we get the sense she&#8217;s trying to tell him that, but he&#8217;s in no mood to hear it.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I can&#8217;t take it</em><br />\n<em>Everything coming down on me</em><br />\n<em>Gotta make a break for it, oh yeah</em><br />\n<em>I can&#8217;t take it oh no more</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>You know I need my respect, woman I demand it</em><br />\n<em>Now listen: You got the nerve to say I won&#8217;t go</em><br />\n<em>I caught you so many times telling that same old lie</em><br />\n<em>I can&#8217;t take it, no more</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>You&#8217;ve got the nerve to say I won&#8217;t go</em><br />\n<em>Well honey I love you but I, but I told you so</em><br />\n<em>I can&#8217;t take it no more, no more</em></p>\n<p>Following the first instrumental break, the vocals build as we get to the heart of our narrator&#8217;s insecurity: he&#8217;s down, but his girl makes him feel like he&#8217;s already out, and if she hasn&#8217;t already walked away from him, it seems he feels she&#8217;s about to.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>You know it&#8217;s always the same</em><br />\n<em>Pulling tighter on the rein</em><br />\n<em>You always make it very plain</em><br />\n<em>That to count me as a loser</em><br />\n<em>You count me as a loser</em><br />\n<em>Before the end of the game</em><br />\n<em>Ain&#8217;t it a shame</em><br />\n<em>Guess I am the one to blame</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Because that sweet talk&#8217;s mine, not hers, whoa whoa</em><br />\n<em>That sweet talk, baby, oh yeah yeah</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>You&#8217;ve got the nerve to ask me why</em><br />\n<em>I caught you so many times telling that same old lie</em></p>\n<p>But just as the song reaches it&#8217;s climax, Bruce slips in a revealing couplet that tells us that our hero is more bark than bite.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I can&#8217;t take it, can&#8217;t take it no more</em><br />\n<em>Guess I&#8217;m gonna fake it, no I just can&#8217;t take it</em></p>\n<p>For all his &#8220;I can&#8217;t take it&#8221; protests, it seems that&#8217;s exactly what he&#8217;s going to do.</p>\n<p>Not all of Bruce&#8217;s protagonists need be virtuous&#8211;if that were so, we&#8217;d be deprived of some of his best work. But we expect to be able to empathize if not sympathize, and &#8220;I Can&#8217;t Take It No More&#8221; fails on both counts.</p>\n<p><strong>I Can&#8217;t Take It No More<br />\nNever recorded</strong><br />\n<strong>Never released</strong><br />\n<strong>First performed:</strong> October 11, 1970 (Richmond, VA)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> January 18, 1971 (South Amboy, NJ)</p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
