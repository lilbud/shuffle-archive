<p>True, Donovan’s first single was a decent hit, charting at #23 in the US and all the way to #4 in the UK. But the 1965 song was a tender acoustic ballad about unrequited love, and that seemed an ill fit for The Castiles’ rock sensibilities.</p>

<p>But cover it the boys did, showing admirable restraint and letting Bruce’s warm, impassioned vocals take center stage.</p>
<p>Fortunately, their performance was captured on tape, so we can listen to the only known time Bruce has played “Catch the Wind” — at The Left Foot in Freehold, more than 50 years ago.</p>
