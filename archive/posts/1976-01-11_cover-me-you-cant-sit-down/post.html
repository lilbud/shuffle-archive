<p>Made famous by local group The Dovells, this encore cover favorite goes back a ways farther. It was originally released as an instrumental in 1959 by The Bim Bam Boos. Take a listen to that first incarnation–it’s certainly recognizable, but it swings more than rocks:</p>

<p>That’s a young Philip Upchurch on guitar. Two years later, he recorded and released it on his own, changing the title a bit to “You Can’t Sit Down.” Still an instrumental, it’s a lot more rocking, and you can hear the signature handclaps:</p>

<p>Fast forward another two years, add lyrics, and we’ve got the version that made it to #3 on the Billboard pop chart. It’s probably that this was the first version to capture Bruce’s attention, but both the Upchurch and Dovell versions feature a rocking beat and smoking sax solo that were bound to capture Bruce’s imagination.</p>

<p>Bruce has performed “You Can’t Sit Down” so many times in concert that it’s difficult to find one standout performance. But this one has to be a contender–from Bruce’s Darkness show in Houston:</p>
