Would he play solo? With a band? Which band? A full set or a few numbers? It was a genuine mystery to me, and since his Broadway debut was only a few days away (and I was planning to be there), I was avoiding any and all on-line speculation to avoid Broadway spoilers.</p>\n<p>Bruce ended up taking the stage twice&#8211;the first a solo set that was truly solo&#8211;just the man and his acoustic guitar. I was expecting something solemn for the evening, given the occasion (a celebration of the athletic achievements and resilience of wounded warriors)&#8211;perhaps &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/11/18/roll-of-the-dice-no-surrender/\">No Surrender</a>,&#8221; &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/12/06/roll-of-the-dice-blood-brothers/\">Blood Brothers,</a>&#8221; or &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/03/02/roll-of-the-dice-devils-dust/\">Devils &amp; Dust</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But Bruce kept it upbeat, opening with &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/01/11/roll-of-the-dice-working-on-the-highway/\">Working on the Highway</a>,&#8221; a beautiful, quiet arrangement of &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/07/04/roll-of-the-dice-the-promised-land/\">The Promised Land</a>,&#8221; and a fun &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/12/25/roll-of-the-dice-dancing-in-the-dark/\">Da</a><span class=\"text_exposed_show\"><a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/12/25/roll-of-the-dice-dancing-in-the-dark/\">ncing in the Dark</a>&#8221; that made everyone forget it was being played acoustically.
