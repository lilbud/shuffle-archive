Bruce has treated us to many interpretations since its 1992 debut, so it’s unsurprising that its beauty and malleability would attract other artists to cover it as well.</p>
<p>One of the best covers of “If I Should Fall Behind” is also the very first: Dion DiMucci (of Dion and the Belmonts) included it as the lead-off track on his <em>Dream on Fire </em>album, released mere months after Bruce’s original debuted on <em>Lucky Town</em>.</p>
<p>Dion gave it his signature doo-wop treatment, and the result is so perfect that if you didn’t know better, you’d think it was first written and recorded in the 1950s instead of the 1990s.</p>
