<p>“New Orleans” was Gary U.S. Bonds’ first-ever single and one of his highest-charting, so of course Bruce was bound to cover it.</p>
<p>Originally released in September 1960, “New Orleans” was credited to simply “U.S. Bonds” (no Gary), a strange stage name chosen for Gary Anderson by his producer, in the bizarre hope that radio DJs would assume the song was a patriotic benefit or PSA.</p>
<p>He might have been right, but the trickery was unnecessary: the song was a hit, peaking at #6 in the U.S. and #16 in the U.K., and it made Bonds a star. He’d never drop the stage surname, but he’d at least start using his real first name the following year.</p>

<p>By the spring of 1976, Bruce had already been covering Bonds on a regular basis, with “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/08/21/cover-me-quarter-to-three/">Quarter to Three</a>” as a standard encore. But on the night of May 13th, Bruce changed it up, swapping out Bonds’ greatest hit for the less popular “New Orleans.”</p>
<p>Why? Maybe it had something to with the location: the Municipal Auditorium in New Orleans.</p>
<p>Even if it was a local pander, it was still an inspired choice. Check out the audio below to hear the band nail the cover and segue seamlessly into “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/12/27/cover-me-detroit-medley/">Detroit Medley</a>.”</p>

<p>Bruce went on to cover “New Orleans” four more times over the years, all at small clubs. It’s been thirty years since the last time he played it, but a well-placed sign on the next tour could change that in  a heartbeat.</p>
