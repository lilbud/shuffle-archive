He&#8217;d performed it at least twice before, but we can forgive him for not remembering&#8211;after all, the last time had been 35 years prior.</p>\n<p>But oh, that early version&#8211;just listen to it. Even through the rough sound quality, Bruce&#8217;s daring arrangement absolutely dazzles. It&#8217;s an E Street Band performance, but it sounds like something The Bruce Springsteen Band might have played.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen   RING OF FIRE 1974\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SmNh7gGOQ0U?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>What I wouldn&#8217;t give for a clean copy of that.</p>\n<p>Bruce wasn&#8217;t the first artist to take liberties with the song. That distinction belongs to Johnny Cash himself, in fact, because the song was originally written by his future wife June Carter and first recorded and released by June&#8217;s sister Anita in 1962, a year before Cash&#8217;s version.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Anita Carter - Ring Of Fire - (ORIGINAL) - (1962).\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OlWGsaorj6U?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Cash loved the song when he first heard it, but he had a vision of a mariachi horn accompaniment, which of course he famously added when he covered the song the following year. It immediately became the song&#8217;s defining trait and an instant classic, peaking at #17 on the Billboard Hot 100 but reaching the top of the Country chart.</p>\n<div
