<p>Way back in the 1980s, pretty much every American household had an answering machine.</p>
<p>An answering machine was kind of like voice mail, except that it was a tape recorder that lived in your house and answered your phone for you. When it answered a call, it would play an outgoing message, and then (just like with voice mail) it would record the caller’s incoming message after a tone. When you returned home, you’d rewind the tape and play back your messages.</p>
<p>By the mid-1980s, answering machines had grown from a novelty item into a necessity, and the creativity of your outgoing message was a topic of frequent conversation and judgment.</p>
<p>If you had an answering machine, it’s a safe bet that at one point or another you agonized over coming up with a greeting that would make people smile or laugh. We all did–even rock stars.</p>

<p>Okay, that wasn’t real.</p>
<p>But still, I guarantee you that even Bruce Springsteen spent more time than he’d have cared to admit coming up with a great answering machine message.</p>
<p>It was time well spent, though, because his <em>actual</em> answering machine message was pretty darn awesome. And yes, this one is a genuine, unreleased, original Springsteen composition.</p>

<p>“Answering Machine” (as this unreleased gem has come to be known) is a fine example of a classic early-eighties Springsteen song: a rocking, uptempo melody that masks the disconnection and alienation in Bruce’s lyrics.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Yeah, there ain’t nobody home</em><br/>
<em>Yeah, there ain’t nobody home</em><br/>
<em>Yeah, there ain’t nobody home to come to the telephone</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>I don’t know when I’m coming back</em><br/>
<em>I don’t know when I’m coming back</em><br/>
<em>I don’t know when I’m coming back, if you got something to say, you better spit it out, Jack</em></p>
<p>While we don’t know exactly when “Answering Machine” was written, the reprise of the back/Jack couplet suggests that it’s a sequel–or perhaps even a prequel–to “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/12/21/roll-of-the-dice-hungry-heart/">Hungry Heart</a>.” One imagines the narrator of that 1980 classic recording this outgoing message in his Baltimore home just before he goes out for his fateful ride.</p>
<p>Unlike “Hungry Heart,” however, Bruce offers the narrator of “Answering Machine” the possibility of redemption. By leaving the metaphorical door open (“I don’t know <em>when</em> I’m coming back” suggests that he might someday), Bruce waters a seed of hope for his narrator’s return home after his latest Kingstown fling.</p>
<p>With “Answering Machine,” Bruce once again displays his impressive talent for songwriting economy, this time honed to a razor-sharp edge. In a mere thirty seconds, we experience and empathize with his character’s loneliness, self-loathing (“there ain’t nobody home”), rootlessness, and resilience. It’s wholly appropriate that he recorded it solo, Nebraska-style, rather than with his band.</p>
<p>“Answering Machine” is a tour de force that belongs in every Springsteen fan’s collection.</p>
