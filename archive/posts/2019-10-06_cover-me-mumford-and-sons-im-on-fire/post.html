<p>I really tried to put some more space between “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/09/11/roll-of-the-dice-im-on-fire/">I’m on Fire</a>” covers, but then this one popped up on YouTube a week ago and suddenly I’m off the wagon.</p>
<p>And yes, I know that Mumford &amp; Sons have been covering “I’m on Fire” for years, and yes I know that many of those performances were captured on video in pretty great quality.</p>
<p>But in my opinion, this one stands head and shoulders above the others:</p>

<p>The band absolutely <em>nails</em> the pacing and the temperature, keeping the song at a slowly building simmer until it explodes before closing on a quietly sinister note.</p>
<p>Honestly, I’m not a huge Mumford &amp; Sons fan, but this particular performance of “I’m on Fire” has immediately become one of my favorites among a sea of covers of this particular song.</p>
