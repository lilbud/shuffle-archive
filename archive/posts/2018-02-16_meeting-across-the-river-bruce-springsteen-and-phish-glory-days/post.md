Bruce headlined Bonnaroo on June 13, 2009; the next day it was Phish's turn.

At the end of their first set, Trey Anastasio introduced his "boyhood hero," and the crowd went wild as Springsteen joined the band on stage. They played "[Mustang Sally](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/07/15/matr-bruce-springsteen-and-just-about-everybody-mustang-sally/)," "[Bobby Jean](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/06/19/roll-of-the-dice-bobby-jean/)," and closed with this absolutely epic "Glory Days." Trey absolutely shreds it.
