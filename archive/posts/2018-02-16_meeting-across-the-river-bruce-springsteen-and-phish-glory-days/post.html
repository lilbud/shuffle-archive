<p>At the end of their first set, Trey Anastasio introduced his “boyhood hero,” and the crowd went wild as Springsteen joined the band on stage. They played “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/07/15/matr-bruce-springsteen-and-just-about-everybody-mustang-sally/">Mustang Sally</a>,” “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/06/19/roll-of-the-dice-bobby-jean/">Bobby Jean</a>,” and closed with this absolutely epic “Glory Days.” Trey absolutely shreds it.</p>
