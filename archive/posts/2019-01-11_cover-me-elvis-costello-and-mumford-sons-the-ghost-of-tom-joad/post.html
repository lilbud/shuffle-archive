Even if you find yourself dismissing 95% of the cover attempts out there, take a few minutes to listen to this one. Not only is it a wonderful, spontaneous performance, but it’s gorgeously captured at one my absolute favorite outdoor venue.</p>

<p>In 2013, Elvis Costello and Mumford &amp; Sons were both headliners at the Sasquatch Festival at the Gorge Amphitheater in Washington State. At some point over the course of the weekend, The One Campaign (co-founded by Bono to fight poverty and disease) convinced Elvis and Mumford &amp; Sons to step away and record a performance to help the campaign raise awareness.</p>
<p>The musicians chose Bruce’s “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/10/17/roll-of-the-dice-the-ghost-of-tom-joad/">The Ghost of Tom Joad</a>,” with a bit of Woody Guthrie’s “Do Re Mi” in the middle.</p>
<p>Mumford takes lead vocals on Bruce’s song; Elvis takes point on Guthrie’s. And when they resume “Tom Joad” and the harmonies kick in, it’s magic.</p>
