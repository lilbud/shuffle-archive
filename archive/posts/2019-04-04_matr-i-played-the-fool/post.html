<p>The Stone Pony first opened its doors in early 1974, and The Blackberry Booze Band was its first house band.</p>
<p>Led by Southside Johnny and Steve Van Zandt, the B.B.B. built a following and refined their sound, eventually becoming the band we now know as Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes.</p>
<p>Twenty years later, the legendary Asbury Park club invited their original band back to celebrate their platinum anniversary, and Southside brought along some friends as well: Jon Bon Jovi, Max Weinberg, Patti Scialfa, and Bruce Springsteen were all on hand for the occasion.</p>
<p>The all-star set kicked off with “I Played the Fool,” and although the sound quality is rough, it’s the only recording we have of Bruce performing the song.</p>

<p>“I Played the Fool” was written by Steve Van Zandt, along with most of the songs on Southside’s classic <em>Hearts of Stone</em> album.  Never released as a single, it’s nevertheless a very strong track on an exceptionally strong album, as well as a horn-fueled crowd-pleaser when performed live.</p>

<p><strong>Bonus: </strong>Although the 1994 performance above is the only one in which Bruce’s vocals can be heard, he did in fact play “I Played the Fool” one other time, at a benefit show in 1998. For that performance, however, Bruce’s contribution was strictly on guitar, with Steve and Southside sharing the vocals. Still, it’s a great performance and a much clearer listen–hear for yourself below.</p>
