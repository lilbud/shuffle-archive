Bruce’s vaults are filled with unreleased songs.

Every few years, it seems, we’re treated to limited releases of outtakes, alternate versions, and ones that got away–sometimes fully-formed and vintage, more often surgically enhanced for tracks that were never finished.

But rarely do we discover unreleased songs that not only made it through a complete studio recording, but also received the full Springsteen music video treatment.

Today, we take a look at one such gem: Bruce’s unreleased 2008 anthem, “Do Your Job.”

Bruce wrote and recorded “Do Your Job” just prior to the financial crisis that almost cratered the American economy. Usually, Bruce is very much in step with the times, but in this case he found himself with a potential hit single that was now unreleasable. Rather than risk sounding tone-deaf, he locked “Do Your Job” away in the vault for safekeeping.

As with much of Bruce’s unreleased material, however, the unreleased single made its way to the Internet where we can now watch it and wonder what might have been. Unfortunately, the timing is once again awful with so many Americans out of work due to the great pandemic, so we can expect the Springsteen camp to deny any association with this shoulda-been-a-hit track.

“Do Your Job” has a classic E Street sound–not surprising, since it seems that it was recorded during one of the breaks on the Magic Tour (as was much of *Working on a Dream*). Featuring a catchy hook, a riff reminiscent of “[The Promised Land,](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/07/04/roll-of-the-dice-the-promised-land/)” and classic Springsteen themes like the value of hard work, Bruce had all the necessary elements to elevate “Do Your Job” to its rightful place in Bruce’s officially released catalog.

 *I can’t believe my eyes, it’s so friggin’ amazing*  
*Americans are getting lazier*  
*They don’t wanna do their jobs, they just want their check*  
*They wanna show up, stand ’round, and then collect*  
*Well baby just don’t work that way*  
*You gotta do your job to earn your pay*  
*From the hot tub man to the grocery clerk*  
*I’m the boss, get back to work*

*Do do do do your job*

*You’ve got places to go, but you can’t get far*  
*Because the valet can’t find your car*  
*You want a stain removed but you still see it*  
*I guess good service is an ancient Chinese secret*  
*I’m not offered men’s soap or any cologne*  
*From the bathroom attendant who’s on his cell phone*  
*It’s a wonder more people don’t go berserk*  
*I’m the boss, get back to work*

*Do do do do your job*

*These bozos are making one of those death traps*  
*By this time next week, that building’s gonna collapse*  
*And the school bus driver hauls a precious load*  
*Hope he’s not driving your kids when his heart explodes*  
*As I look around I see everywhere*  
*Americans who just don’t care*  
*At the risk of sounding like a Repetitive Joe*  
*I’m the boss, get back to work*

*Do do do do your job*

Even the video is classic Springsteen–from the common man cameos to the requisite beach walkabout, all of Bruce’s trademarks are on full display. He even shoots off a snot rocket!

To this day, Bruce has never performed “Do Your Job” in concert, and given the current state of the economy and what will probably prove to be a long and gradual recovery, I don’t believe we’ll hear it make Bruce’s set lists any time soon.
