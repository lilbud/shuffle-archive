Greetings, all–

Since I launched this blog exactly a month ago, I’ve been struggling with how to deal with references to *Springsteen on Broadway* performance notes. So far, I’ve managed to punt the issue, since none of the songs I’ve covered so far appear in it (that’s as much of a spoiler as you’re ever going to see here).

But since the dice will eventually turn up a song that’s part of the show, I’ve decided how I’m going to deal with it when it does, and I wanted to let you know in case you’re concerned about spoilers:

Simply put, I’m not going to reference the Broadway show at all, which means that any “Last performed” dates cited will ignore anything on the current run. That policy makes it easy for me to avoid giving spoilers, and frankly it also keeps me from having to update those posts on a five-times-weekly basis. Please show the same consideration with your comments.

When the run ends, I’ll go back and refresh any posts that are relevant, but until then, we’ll live together in blissful ignorance.

(That said, if you haven’t seen the show yet, you *really* should. It’s life-affirming.)

Thanks, and now back to our program…
