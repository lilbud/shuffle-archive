The Houserockers aren’t the only rock band keeping the Pittsburgh sound alive.

The Ghost Hounds perfectly capture the gritty sound of the Steel City, and if you haven’t heard of them yet, you will. Before the pandemic took them off the road, The Ghost Hounds were opening for acts you probably heard of: The Rolling Stones, ZZ Top, Bob Seger, and Willie Nelson, for example.

With each show, they’ve been building a following, and their most recent album, is very much worth seeking out.

They may not be on the road at the moment, but they haven’t let the pandemic stop them from making music. Back in May, they released a cover of “Thunder Road” recorded with guest artist Sasha Allen. (You may have seen Sasha on on Broadway, or on tour with the Stones.)

*The Voice,*

As revealed in a Zoom call this summer, the band selected “Thunder Road” over such rock classics like “I Love Rock and Roll” and “,” fully aware that choosing Bruce’s classic would require a “really bold attempt.”

It takes guts to cover “Thunder Road,” but The Ghost Hounds have guts to spare. They’ve arranged the song as a straight-up rocker and fully commit to it. Paired with a gorgeously filmed black and white video that expertly captures the romance of the song, their version of “Thunder Road” demands not just a listen, but a viewing.

“Thunder Road” will grace The Ghost Hounds’ next album as well–said album is in the can and awaiting release.

Their web site describes The Ghost Hounds as “a rock ‘n’ roll band at a time when the world needs more of them.”

I couldn’t say it any better.

Here’s a behind-the-scenes look at the band’s recording session for “Thunder Road.” It’s fun to watch them work out the song.
