didn&#8217;t make the Top 40 when it was released (it peaked at #44), but it quickly became a standard in just about every American ballpark, where crowds clap, sing, and dance along between innings.</p>\n<p>As beloved as &#8220;Centerfield&#8221; has become, it was still something of a surprise to see it featured as a nightly set list staple when Fogerty joined Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band on their Vote for Change Tour in October 2004.</p>\n<p>That tour had a decidedly political message, with tight and carefully constructed sets designed to spur activism from an audience that was perhaps politically aligned with John and Bruce but not necessarily inclined to get out and vote.</p>\n<p>&#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/11/09/matr-john-fogerty-and-bruce-springsteen-fortunate-son/\">Fortunate Son</a>,&#8221;

But &#8220;Centerfield&#8221; was a curveball&#8211;although perhaps it shouldn&#8217;t have been, since Bruce is known to be quite the lifelong baseball fan himself.</p>\n<p>The chance to perform &#8220;Centerfield&#8221; with the song&#8217;s original artist was probably too tempting to pass up, and the song became Fogerty&#8217;s first number upon taking the stage each night.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen w/ John Fogerty Centerfield (Live VFC 2004 10 05)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ExdLcwIZdsk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer;
