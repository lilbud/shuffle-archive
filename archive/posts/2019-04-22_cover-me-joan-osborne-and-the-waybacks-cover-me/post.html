Some are <a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/07/26/cover-me-the-waybacks-and-joan-osborne-born-in-the-usa/">relatively faithful</a>, some are <a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/05/15/cover-me-joan-osborne-and-the-waybacks-im-goin-down/">dramatic re-imaginings</a>, some are clever mash-ups, but all of them are great, and this is an album very much worth having.</p>
<p>I don’t mind confessing that I do not like the song “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/01/13/roll-of-the-dice-cover-me/">Cover Me.</a>”  Bruce’s version has always left me cold, and if I stack-ranked his entire catalog I’m pretty sure you’d find “Cover Me” at the bottom of it.</p>
<p>But this version redeems it and then some. Brilliantly mashing it up with Edwin Starr’s “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/05/27/cover-me-war/">War</a>” (which of course Bruce was known to cover on the Born in the U.S.A. Tour) breathes new life into the song–so much so that it’s a wonder that it never occurred to Bruce to pair them back in 1985.</p>
<p>Take a listen and enjoy–and then do yourself a favor and check out the rest of the album as well. Brilliant stuff.</p>
