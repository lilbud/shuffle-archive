<p>Bruce Springsteen and Joe Strummer had more than a bit of mutual admiration between them, each citing the other as an influence.</p>
<p>It’s a wonder then that Bruce hasn’t covered Strummer and The Clash more often. There are exceptions, like “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/04/09/matr-bruce-springsteen-elvis-costello-steve-van-zandt-dave-grohl-london-calling/">London Calling</a>” and “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/03/13/cover-me-coma-girl/">Coma Girl,</a>” but rarely does Bruce give one of Joe’s songs multiple outings in concert.</p>
<p>That changed in Pittsburgh on the High Hopes Tour, when temporary E Streeter Tom Morello joined Bruce on vocals to open with a cover of a song Morello was more than a bit familiar with.</p>
<p>The Clash released “Clampdown” as a single in Australia only, the second single off their landmark 1979 album, <em>London Calling. </em></p>

<p>“Clampdown” never charted, but the punk anthem galvanized audiences, influenced young rockers, and inspired a host of covers with its galvanizing rallying cry.</p>
<p>One such band heavily influenced by The Clash was Rage Against the Machine, who covered “Clampdown” in their very first show… <em>ever</em>. In fact, “Clampdown” was only the second song they ever played live, and it was miraculously captured on video. Here’s that performance from 1991, featuring a 27-year-old Tom Morello:</p>

<p>So when Bruce decided to make “Clampdown” their show opener that April evening in Pittsburgh and asked Tom to join him on vocals, Morello was more than up to the task.</p>

<p>It was a brilliant decision: “Clampdown” rocketed the show out of the starting gate. Bruce was so pleased with the way it turned out that  he went on to perform it not once but <em>five </em>more times over the next four weeks (although he would drop the horns immediately after that debut performance in Pittsburgh).</p>
<p>By their third performance a week later in Sunrise, they’d nailed both arrangement and performance. Within days, Bruce released an official video of that performance on his YouTube channel.</p>

<p>Bruce, Tom, and the band continued performing “Clampdown” through the end of the High Hopes Tour. When Morello left the band at that point, The Clash’s anthem went too. But with Morello a frequent guest star on E Street tours and “Clampdown” now firmly established in the E Street repertoire, don’t count it out for an encore appearance.</p>
