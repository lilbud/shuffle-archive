Even more than the title track, &#8220;Linda Let Me Be The One&#8221; is an homage to Phil Spector, starting with that &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/06/01/matr-bruce-springsteen-and-ronnie-spector-be-my-baby/\">Be My Baby</a>&#8221; beat that Bruce loved so much at the time.</p>\n<p>(That famous beat shows up again and again in Bruce&#8217;s mid-seventies songwriting. See &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/02/08/roll-of-the-dice-gotta-get-that-feeling/\">Gotta Get That Feeling</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/10/03/roll-of-the-dice-someday-well-be-together/\">Someday (We&#8217;ll Be Together)</a>,&#8221; for example.)</p>\n<p>But it&#8217;s more than the beat: &#8220;Linda Let Me Be The One&#8221; is a perfectly constructed Spectorian girl group song from its lush, romantic backing track to its lyrical melodrama. (I&#8217;ve always considered &#8220;Linda&#8221; to be an answer song of sorts to &#8220;Leader of the Pack.&#8221;) Even the title and chorus are hat tips to Spector&#8211;there&#8217;s not a lot of difference between &#8220;will you let me be the one&#8221; and &#8220;won&#8217;t you please be my baby.&#8221;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>The midnight boys are outside scraping tears up off the street</em><br />\n<em>Standing guard beneath the window where only Linda sleeps</em><br />\n<em>The leader is a kid named Eddie walking like an angel in defeat</em><br />\n<em>He trashes her old man&#8217;s car, slashes Linda&#8217;s name in the seat</em><br />\n<em>Calling out:</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Linda, will you let me be the one</em><br />\n<em>Linda, will you let me be the one</em><br />\n<em>Linda, will you let me be the one</em><br />\n<em>Linda, will you let me be the one</em></p>\n<p>Eddie certainly isn&#8217;t the first of Bruce&#8217;s bad boy protagonists, and he wouldn&#8217;t be the last. But geez, someone needs to give poor Eddie some dating tips. I&#8217;m no one&#8217;s Casanova, but I know that vandalizing a girl&#8217;s father&#8217;s car probably isn&#8217;t the best way to win her affection.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s almost certainly some unstated backstory here: we can assume that like Romeo and Juliet, Eddie and Linda do not have parental approval to be together. Bruce implies that Eddie is in a gang, and presumably Linda&#8217;s father has forbidden them to date. Eddie acts out his rage and impotence by vandalizing the car, even while pleading for Linda&#8217;s love from below her window (another Romeo and Juliet evocation).</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s a lot of information conveyed in just five lines. It&#8217;s a brilliant set-up, but if we&#8217;re honest, the rest of the song never quite lives up to either the standard or the premise of that beautiful first verse.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>In a room full of contenders&#8230; Eddie spars\u00a0</em><br />\n<em>&#8216;Til he drops to his bed and surrenders draped in the scarves</em><br />\n<em>He stole from Linda&#8217;s bedroom the night he laid at her feet</em><br />\n<em>When the midnight boys were stranded down on Cason Street</em></p>\n<p>There&#8217;s something distractingly curious about that first line: the &#8220;&#8230;Eddie spars&#8221; is so disconnected from the rest of the lyric that we can intuitively sense that something else was meant to go in the empty space.</p>\n<p>And something was. In an earlier version of &#8220;Linda Let Me Be The One&#8221; (which reportedly was the version considered for release on <em>Born to Run</em> rather than the\u00a0<em>Tracks</em> version), we hear the line as Bruce originally wrote it: &#8220;In a room full of contenders <em>shadow boxing</em>, Eddie spars.&#8221;</p>\n<audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-26080-3\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/lindaletmebetheone_unofficial.mp3?_=3\" /><a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/lindaletmebetheone_unofficial.mp3\">https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/lindaletmebetheone_unofficial.mp3</a></audio>\n<p>Now\u00a0<em>that</em> is a great line. Like, seriously great. So why did Bruce surgically excise it from the final lyrics? I have absolutely no idea, but this is the sort of thing I obsess about. The verse is weaker without it.</p>\n<p>The second line recovers the emotional momentum with an achingly beautiful image of Eddie wrapping himself in Linda&#8217;s scarves, the closest he&#8217;s able to get to his love&#8211;but the third line takes Eddie&#8217;s supplication just a bit too far, losing the listener&#8217;s (this one, at least) empathy and replacing it with pity.</p>\n<p>If the second verse lyrically stumbles, the bridge makes up for it with what could have been my second-favorite sax solo on <em>Born to Run</em>. Oh, how I would have loved to see Clarence perform it in concert.</p>\n<p>Bruce&#8217;s final verse offers no resolution and only hints at absolution (along with a &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/01/08/roll-of-the-dice-spare-parts/\">Spare Parts</a>&#8221; foreshadow in the third line):</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>In the basement of St. Mary&#8217;s, Eddie hides from the rain</em><br />\n<em>In with the stolen sisters &#8217;til the streets are dry again</em><br />\n<em>Talking fast cars and spare parts, empty homes and broken hearts</em><br />\n<em>Distant worlds with strange girls and kneeling with Linda in the dark</em></p>\n<p>Now that was unexpected. We think we&#8217;re about to get either a romantic reunion or a tragic break-up, but the die was cast before the song even started. &#8220;Linda Let Me Be The One&#8221; is a post-breakup song, so poor Eddie looks to the church to provide solace for his heartbreak.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve never quite decided whether I find this last scene touching or funny. I suppose it&#8217;s a little of both. The notion of a gang leader so lovesick, so lonely, and so trapped by his own image that he has to talk about his girl troubles with the nuns is a comically sad one, so maybe Bruce was indeed trying to paint Eddie as more of a sad sack than a bad seed.</p>\n<p>In any event, it&#8217;s probably for the best that &#8220;Linda Let Me Be The One&#8221; was cast off from\u00a0<em>Born to Run</em>. While musically a great fit, Bruce&#8217;s lyrics were just a tad shy of the bar he&#8217;d cleared with every other song on the album. Still, it&#8217;s a beautiful outtake that deserves its official release status on <em>Tracks</em>.</p>\n<p>It also deserved to be played live. But that didn&#8217;t happen until 2014, and even then only once&#8211;and that one time was too late for The Big Man to elevate.</p>\n<p>The E Street Band pulled it off pretty well regardless. (Well, mostly&#8230; there&#8217;s a rough patch toward the end, but we&#8217;ll forgive them. After all, it had been almost forty years since they&#8217;d recorded it.)</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen &amp; The ESB \u261c\u2764\ufe0f\u261e Linda Let Me Be The One \u222b Hearts Of Stone {2014}\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wG9_OU0J04U?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>But while Bruce may have kept &#8220;Linda&#8221; in the vault until 1998, he liberated her melody much sooner&#8211;an epiphany that Bruce seemed to realize in the moment when he performed &#8220;Linda Let Me Be The One&#8221; for the first and only time to date, immediately after he performed the song it bears an uncanny resemblance to: &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/04/22/roll-of-the-dice-i-wanna-marry-you/\">I Wanna Marry You</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Linda Let Me Be the One (edited)- Springsteen - BB&amp;T Arena Sunrise, FL - April 29, 2014\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KtyeEEnkLAk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>(I have no idea why he thought they were written twenty years apart though.
