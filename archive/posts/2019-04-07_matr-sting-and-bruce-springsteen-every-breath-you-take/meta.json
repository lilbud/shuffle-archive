The E Street Band went on hiatus after that tour; they wouldn&#8217;t tour again for more than a decade.</p>\n<p>But that tour was notable for more than its closure of a chapter of E Street history&#8211;it also marked the birth of a friendship that has stood the test of time ever since.</p>\n<p>Although the six-week tour featured a top-notch array of headlining talent that included Peter Gabriel, Tracey Chapman, and Youssou N&#8217;Dour, it was Sting who Bruce grew close with over the course of the tour.</p>\n<p>Their on-stage chemistry and obvious love for each other&#8217;s music was evident from the start, and it didn&#8217;t take long for Bruce to invite Sting to join him during his set for a duet on &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/03/04/roll-of-the-dice-the-river/\">The River</a>.&#8221; Two weeks, later, Sting returned the compliment by inviting Bruce to join him for his set-closing &#8220;Every Breath You Take,&#8221; and their reciprocal guest appearances instantly became a nightly highlight.</p>\n<p>By that time, of course, &#8220;Every Breath You Take&#8221; was already a classic. Even though the song was only five years old in 1988, it wasn&#8217;t just a number one song the year it came out, it was\u00a0<em>the\u00a0</em>number one song for the entire year, riding the top of the charts in the U.S. for a full eight weeks. Heck, it was the fifth-highest selling single for the entire\u00a0<em>decade</em>.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"The Police - Every Breath You Take (Official Music Video)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OMOGaugKpzs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>So by 1988, with The Police in his rear-view mirror, it was no wonder that Sting clung to their signature song and made it his nightly closer.</p>\n<p>The tour finale was in Buenos Aires, and it was filmed for television broadcast. In the clip below, we can see just how comfortable they&#8217;d become in each other&#8217;s presence and how much joy they took in playing together. Check it out, and just try to keep from smiling.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Sting, Bruce Springsteen - Every Breath You Take (Live)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6GYt6mzQ3Xo?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>(I love the moment at about the one minute mark where Sting does his best Bruce impression!)</p>\n<p>Bruce and Sting have remained close friends, and they&#8217;ve performed with or for each other several times over the decades since.
