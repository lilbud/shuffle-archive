The *Human Rights Now!* Tour of 1988 was a victory lap of sorts for Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band, although we didn't know it then. The E Street Band went on hiatus after that tour; they wouldn't tour again for more than a decade.

But that tour was notable for more than its closure of a chapter of E Street history–it also marked the birth of a friendship that has stood the test of time ever since.

Although the six-week tour featured a top-notch array of headlining talent that included Peter Gabriel, Tracey Chapman, and Youssou N'Dour, it was Sting who Bruce grew close with over the course of the tour.

Their on-stage chemistry and obvious love for each other's music was evident from the start, and it didn't take long for Bruce to invite Sting to join him during his set for a duet on "[The River](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/03/04/roll-of-the-dice-the-river/)." Two weeks, later, Sting returned the compliment by inviting Bruce to join him for his set-closing "Every Breath You Take," and their reciprocal guest appearances instantly became a nightly highlight.

By that time, of course, "Every Breath You Take" was already a classic. Even though the song was only five years old in 1988, it wasn't just a number one song the year it came out, it was *the* number one song for the entire year, riding the top of the charts in the U.S. for a full eight weeks. Heck, it was the fifth-highest selling single for the entire *decade*.

So by 1988, with The Police in his rear-view mirror, it was no wonder that Sting clung to their signature song and made it his nightly closer.

The tour finale was in Buenos Aires, and it was filmed for television broadcast. In the clip below, we can see just how comfortable they'd become in each other's presence and how much joy they took in playing together. Check it out, and just try to keep from smiling.

(I love the moment at about the one minute mark where Sting does his best Bruce impression!)

Bruce and Sting have remained close friends, and they've performed with or for each other several times over the decades since. But to me, their finest on-stage moment will always be that October night in Argentina.
