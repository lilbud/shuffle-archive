<p>If you don’t know who <a href="https://www.justinrobertsmusic.com/">Justin Roberts</a> is, you probably don’t have kids at home.</p>
<p>If you do know who Justin Roberts is, you’re probably wondering what a four-time Grammy nominee for Best Musical Album for Children is doing covering an existential song like Bruce Springsteen’s “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/05/30/roll-of-the-dice-one-minute-youre-here/">One Minute You’re Here</a>.”</p>
<p>But if you’ve ever listened closely to Justin’s music, you know this Chicago-based singer-songwriter has a knack for writing poignant yet comforting songs that honor kids’ ability to deal with issues like death or divorce.</p>

<p>So while branching into covers by mainstream musical icons may be a bit of a departure for Roberts, his choice of song is still very much on-brand.</p>
<p>As for his performance… well, to be completely honest, I probably would have spotlighted it even if Justin had played it safe and stuck to the album arrangement.</p>
<p>But he didn’t. Instead, he invited Anna Steinhoff (his wife) to join him and arranged the song as a musical duet for guitar and cello.</p>
<p>And it’s just perfect.</p>

<p>Anna’s low cello adds a vein of sadness to the song, but Justin’s delicate guitar keeps their performance of “One Minute You’re Here” light on its feet and moving ever forward, just like life.</p>
<p>“One Minute You’re Here” is a song that speaks to many of us, which is probably why there are so many covers out there for such a new song. But Justin and Anna’s version is the first I’ve seen that adds something new to Bruce’s original, and it’s well worth a listen.</p>
