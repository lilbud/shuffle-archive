Some days the dice let you down. But being the completist that I am…

“Black Sun Rising” is a early Springsteen composition. To my knowledge it was never recorded in a studio, and Bruce only performed it twice, both times in 1970, during his Steel Mill era.

*very*

The only known recording is virtually unintelligible, so I’m not even going to begin to take it apart and analyze it. Feel free to give it a listen if you want to try, but I’ll understand if you sit this one out.

got further than I did figuring out the lyrics–enough to figure out that it’s a very unsubtle, of-the-time polemic:

[Springsteenlyrics.com](http://Springsteenlyrics.com)



*Well there’s a black sun risin’*  
*Shining darkness on the White House*  
*Well there’s a black sun risin’*  
*Shining darkness on the White House*



*Turn on the white light protection, come on*



*Now there’s a new day dawn*  
*When no-one’s gonna pay the cost*  
*They never ???*  
*???*  
*Oh revolution is ours*



*Man has told me to propagate love*  
*I’m gonna get you, oh, oh, oh, oh, all right*

Yeah, this is one rarity I don’t need to hear in concert.

Just rolled the dice again and got something from the HT/LT era that’s much easier to work with. Look for it soon.
