<p>I don’t usually feature a cover artist a second time so soon after the first, but:</p>
<p>a) Alexander Schmidt’s cover of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/08/08/roll-of-the-dice-tougher-than-the-rest/">Tougher Than the Rest</a>” is just gorgeous–even better than his <a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/01/27/cover-me-alexander-schmidt-band-im-on-fire/">previous cover</a> of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/09/11/roll-of-the-dice-im-on-fire/">I’m on Fire</a>.” It needs to be heard.</p>
<p>b) He’s got a new album (his debut, I think) of original material called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL12S3iSt14S9n9mLoFRPUy9g-YfVORcbW"><em>Maverick</em></a>, and I’m very much enjoying my first listen.</p>
<p>In these quarantined days, talented artists need all the exposure they can get, so I’m happy to recommend that you check Alexander’s album out. But first check this out.</p>
