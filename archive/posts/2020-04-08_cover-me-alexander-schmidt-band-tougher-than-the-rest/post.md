I don’t usually feature a cover artist a second time so soon after the first, but:

a) Alexander Schmidt’s cover of “[Tougher Than the Rest](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/08/08/roll-of-the-dice-tougher-than-the-rest/)” is just gorgeous–even better than his [previous cover](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/01/27/cover-me-alexander-schmidt-band-im-on-fire/) of “[I’m on Fire](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/09/11/roll-of-the-dice-im-on-fire/).” It needs to be heard.

b) He’s got a new album (his debut, I think) of original material called [*Maverick*](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL12S3iSt14S9n9mLoFRPUy9g-YfVORcbW), and I’m very much enjoying my first listen.

In these quarantined days, talented artists need all the exposure they can get, so I’m happy to recommend that you check Alexander’s album out. But first check this out.
