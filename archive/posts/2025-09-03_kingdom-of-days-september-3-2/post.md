**2012:** Night Two at Philadelphia’s Citizens Bank Park was a Labor Day special, opening with an acoustic tour premiere of “[Factory](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/10/31/roll-of-the-dice-factory/)” as part of a five-song [*Darkness on the Edge of Town*](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/07/05/album-companion-darkness-on-the-edge-of-town/)mini-set. The show stayed intense all the way through, which may be why Bruce omitted setlisted gems like “[Ain’t Good Enough for You](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/06/02/roll-of-the-dice-aint-good-enough-for-you/),” “Love Train,” “[(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/09/23/cover-me-your-love-keeps-lifting-me-higher-and-higher/),” “[Incident on 57th Street](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/12/14/roll-of-the-dice-incident-on-57th-street/),” and “[My Love Will Not Let You Down](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/01/24/roll-of-the-dice-my-love-will-not-let-you-down/).” What a show *that* would have been!

**2023:** Featuring the tour premiere of “[Two Hearts](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/05/28/roll-of-the-dice-two-hearts/)” and rarities like “Jungleland” and “[Jersey Gir](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/07/24/cover-me-roll-of-the-dice-jersey-girl/)l,” the third and final show at MetLife Stadium seems to promise a looser setlist in the autumn leg of World Tour 2023. Sadly, it proves to be the E Street Band’s last show of the year.
