There are times when we all need a song like that, especially during a global pandemic&#8211;which is why Joe broke it out last summer for his contribution to Feeding America&#8217;s Rock for Relief benefit.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Rock For Relief - Joe Grushecky and The Houserockers - &quot;Everything&#039;s Gonna Work Out Right&quot;\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/M6sFMtDO6iM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Bruce may not have contributed to &#8220;Everything&#8217;s Going to Work Out Right,&#8221; but he did perform it with Joe and The Houserockers&#8211;twice, in fact, on two very appropriate occasions. The first time was at the very first Light of Day benefit in November 2000; the second was at the Flood Aid benefit show that Joe organized four years later to help the victims of Hurricane Ivan.
