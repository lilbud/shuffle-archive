<p>First published in 1867, “The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze” was written by George Leybourne and Gaston Lyle based on the exploits of trapeze artist Jules Leotard.</p>
<p>First recorded by Walter O’Keefe in 1932, the song did a slow burn before becoming a hit in 1934. But once it did, “The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze” embedded itself in popular culture, inspiring a 1934 short story by William Saroyan and a 1935 film with W.C. Fields.</p>

<p>Many artists covered “The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze” over the ensuing years: Eddie Cantor, Burl Ives, Bing Crosby to name just a few. In later years, though, the song grew dated and fell out of fashion.</p>
<p>Until 2006, that is, when Bruce Springsteen dusted it off for his Americana-based Seeger Sessions Tour.</p>
<p>Although Bruce and the Sessions Band rehearsed the song before the tour even started (and even played it at a public rehearsal show), “The Daring Young Man  on the Flying Trapeze” didn’t debut properly until the final show of the tour’s American leg, in Holmdel, New Jersey.</p>
<p>Although their arrangement was traditional, Bruce found the wry, sarcastic humor at the heart of the song and… well, let’s say he salted the lyrics a bit.</p>

<p>Bruce went on to perform “The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze” once more–in London that autumn. We haven’t heard from that daring young man since.</p>
