It worked: Bonds indeed came back to the charts, leading off with Bruce&#8217;s original song &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/09/06/rotd-matr-cover-me-gary-u-s-bonds-bruce-springsteen-the-e-street-band-this-little-girl/\">This Little Girl,</a>&#8221; which peaked at #11 on the Billboard Hot 100.</p>\n<p><em>Dedication</em> worked so well that the trio decided to do an encore. In 1982, Bonds released his follow-up album&#8211;also produced by Bruce and Steve&#8211;entitled <em>On the Line.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>Dedication\u00a0</em>included three original songs written by Bruce;\u00a0for\u00a0<em>On the Line</em>, Bruce contributed a whopping\u00a0<em>seven</em>.</p>\n<p>Only one of those seven songs became a hit single though: the comical but slyly topical &#8220;Out of Work,&#8221; which reached as high as #21 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the summer of &#8217;82.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Gary U.S. Bonds - Out Of Work\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aKxfxixwdXE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Even if you&#8217;ve never heard it before, &#8220;Out of Work&#8221; might sound a bit familiar. That&#8217;s because Bruce built it on the chassis of &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/12/21/roll-of-the-dice-hungry-heart/\">Hungry Heart</a>.&#8221; Give it another listen and you&#8217;ll hear what I mean.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s not the only aspect of &#8220;Out of Work&#8221; that rings familiar, though: that&#8217;s a bona fide E Street Band backing track, with the entire band credited except for Bruce&#8211;who nevertheless is still audibly present on backing vocals. This is Bruce and the E Street Band at their River-era peak, complete with a classic Big Man sax solo.</p>\n<p>Lyrically, &#8220;Out of Work&#8221; is sneaky: it starts out like an homage to the doo wop classic &#8220;Get a Job&#8221; but takes a sudden political turn in the last verse.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>8 A.M., I&#8217;m up and my feet beating on the sidewalk</em><br />\n<em>Down at the unemployment agency, all I get&#8217;s talk</em><br />\n<em>I check the want ads but there just ain&#8217;t nobody hiring</em><br />\n<em>What&#8217;s a man supposed to do when he&#8217;s down and</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Out of work</em><br />\n<em>I need a job, I&#8217;m out of work</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;m unemployed, I&#8217;m out of work</em><br />\n<em>I need a job, I&#8217;m out of work</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I go to pick my girl up</em><br />\n<em>Her name is Linda Brown</em><br />\n<em>Her dad invites me in</em><br />\n<em>He tells me to sit down</em><br />\n<em>The small talk that we&#8217;re making</em><br />\n<em>Is going pretty smooth</em><br />\n<em>But then he drops a bomb</em><br />\n<em>&#8220;Son, what d&#8217;ya do?&#8221;</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I&#8217;m out of work</em><br />\n<em>I need a job, I&#8217;m out of work</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;m unemployed, I&#8217;m out of work</em><br />\n<em>I need a job, I&#8217;m out of work</em><br />\n<em>Yeah, yeah, yeah</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Hey, Mr. President, I know you got your plans</em><br />\n<em>You&#8217;re doing all you can now to aid the little man</em><br />\n<em>We got to do our best to whip that inflation down</em><br />\n<em>Maybe you got a job for me just driving you around</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>(I&#8217;m out of work)</em><br />\n<em>These tough times, they&#8217;re enough</em><br />\n<em>To make a man lose his mind</em><br />\n<em>(I&#8217;m out of work)</em><br />\n<em>Up there you got a job but down here below</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I&#8217;m out of work</em><br />\n<em>I need a job, I&#8217;m out of work</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;m unemployed, I&#8217;m out of work</em><br />\n<em>I need a job, I&#8217;m out of work</em></p>\n<p>A few months ago, we traced the evolution of &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/03/04/roll-of-the-dice-the-river/\">The River,</a>&#8221; starting with Bruce&#8217;s unreleased 1979 outtake &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/02/16/roll-of-the-dice-oh-angelyne/\">Oh Angelyne</a>.&#8221; That was where we first heard the influence of the rapidly receding economy on Bruce&#8217;s songwriting.</p>\n<p>By 1981, the U.S. was experiencing its third straight year of double-digit inflation. By 1982, the year that Bonds released &#8220;Out of Work,&#8221; the U.S. unemployment rate had topped 10% for the first time since the Great Depression. So while &#8220;Out of Work&#8221; may today sound akin to a novelty song, if you heard it on the radio at the time you likely winced while you laughed.</p>\n<p>Bonds always understood the barbed truth hidden beneath the song&#8217;s surface. In 2020, just a few weeks in to the Great Shutdown, he released an updated version of &#8220;Out of Work,&#8221; with cleverly re-written lyrics. (I&#8217;m sure Bruce didn&#8217;t mind.)</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Out of Work (the home edition)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QFZmCgs_VM0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Bonds&#8217; new version was even more under the radar than his original version, but it was also way more resonant.</p>\n<p>Fans who caught it no doubt had the same laughing-through-tears reaction as radio listeners in the summer of &#8217;82.</p>\n<p><strong>Out of Work</strong><br />\n<strong>Recorded:</strong> Early 1982<br />\n<strong>Released:\u00a0</strong><em>On the Line</em> (1982)<br />\n<strong>Never performed</strong></p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
