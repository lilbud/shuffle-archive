It worked: Bonds indeed came back to the charts, leading off with Bruce’s original song “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/09/06/rotd-matr-cover-me-gary-u-s-bonds-bruce-springsteen-the-e-street-band-this-little-girl/">This Little Girl,</a>” which peaked at #11 on the Billboard Hot 100.</p>
<p><em>Dedication</em> worked so well that the trio decided to do an encore. In 1982, Bonds released his follow-up album–also produced by Bruce and Steve–entitled <em>On the Line. </em></p>
<p><em>Dedication </em>included three original songs written by Bruce; for <em>On the Line</em>, Bruce contributed a whopping <em>seven</em>.</p>
<p>Only one of those seven songs became a hit single though: the comical but slyly topical “Out of Work,” which reached as high as #21 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the summer of ’82.</p>

<p>Even if you’ve never heard it before, “Out of Work” might sound a bit familiar. That’s because Bruce built it on the chassis of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/12/21/roll-of-the-dice-hungry-heart/">Hungry Heart</a>.” Give it another listen and you’ll hear what I mean.</p>
<p>That’s not the only aspect of “Out of Work” that rings familiar, though: that’s a bona fide E Street Band backing track, with the entire band credited except for Bruce–who nevertheless is still audibly present on backing vocals. This is Bruce and the E Street Band at their River-era peak, complete with a classic Big Man sax solo.</p>
<p>Lyrically, “Out of Work” is sneaky: it starts out like an homage to the doo wop classic “Get a Job” but takes a sudden political turn in the last verse.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>8 A.M., I’m up and my feet beating on the sidewalk</em><br/>
<em>Down at the unemployment agency, all I get’s talk</em><br/>
<em>I check the want ads but there just ain’t nobody hiring</em><br/>
<em>What’s a man supposed to do when he’s down and</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Out of work</em><br/>
<em>I need a job, I’m out of work</em><br/>
<em>I’m unemployed, I’m out of work</em><br/>
<em>I need a job, I’m out of work</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>I go to pick my girl up</em><br/>
<em>Her name is Linda Brown</em><br/>
<em>Her dad invites me in</em><br/>
<em>He tells me to sit down</em><br/>
<em>The small talk that we’re making</em><br/>
<em>Is going pretty smooth</em><br/>
<em>But then he drops a bomb</em><br/>
<em>“Son, what d’ya do?”</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>I’m out of work</em><br/>
<em>I need a job, I’m out of work</em><br/>
<em>I’m unemployed, I’m out of work</em><br/>
<em>I need a job, I’m out of work</em><br/>
<em>Yeah, yeah, yeah</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Hey, Mr. President, I know you got your plans</em><br/>
<em>You’re doing all you can now to aid the little man</em><br/>
<em>We got to do our best to whip that inflation down</em><br/>
<em>Maybe you got a job for me just driving you around</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>(I’m out of work)</em><br/>
<em>These tough times, they’re enough</em><br/>
<em>To make a man lose his mind</em><br/>
<em>(I’m out of work)</em><br/>
<em>Up there you got a job but down here below</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>I’m out of work</em><br/>
<em>I need a job, I’m out of work</em><br/>
<em>I’m unemployed, I’m out of work</em><br/>
<em>I need a job, I’m out of work</em></p>
<p>A few months ago, we traced the evolution of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/03/04/roll-of-the-dice-the-river/">The River,</a>” starting with Bruce’s unreleased 1979 outtake “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/02/16/roll-of-the-dice-oh-angelyne/">Oh Angelyne</a>.” That was where we first heard the influence of the rapidly receding economy on Bruce’s songwriting.</p>
<p>By 1981, the U.S. was experiencing its third straight year of double-digit inflation. By 1982, the year that Bonds released “Out of Work,” the U.S. unemployment rate had topped 10% for the first time since the Great Depression. So while “Out of Work” may today sound akin to a novelty song, if you heard it on the radio at the time you likely winced while you laughed.</p>
<p>Bonds always understood the barbed truth hidden beneath the song’s surface. In 2020, just a few weeks in to the Great Shutdown, he released an updated version of “Out of Work,” with cleverly re-written lyrics. (I’m sure Bruce didn’t mind.)</p>

<p>Bonds’ new version was even more under the radar than his original version, but it was also way more resonant.</p>
<p>Fans who caught it no doubt had the same laughing-through-tears reaction as radio listeners in the summer of ’82.</p>
