That doesn’t leave me much to write about, so I don’t.</p>
<p>Every once in a while, though, I stumble back across one of them, and if it moves me in the moment I may just spotlight it anyway and give myself the morning off.</p>
<p>Today’s one of those days. I love this cover of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/11/10/roll-of-the-dice-back-in-your-arms/">Back in Your Arms</a>” by David Mullen, and if I knew how to reach the Scotland-based (at the time, at least) artist, I’d let him know. But his video is eleven years old, and it looks like he stopped updating his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5t7bTPwIMUdbBruKtqWG0w">YouTube channel</a> three years later. (It’s worth checking out anyway, because there are a few very nice off-the-beaten-track Springsteen covers there.)</p>

<p>Bruce’s original version of “Back in Your Arms” is exquisitely melodramatic, but the song works equally well in an easier, stripped-down arrangement. Mullen clearly appreciates the source material, and his respect for Bruce’s lyrics comes through in his delivery. I enjoy this one a lot.</p>
<p>David, if you’re out there reading this by chance: thanks for sharing your talent with us!</p>
