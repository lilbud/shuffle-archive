<p>Continuing our look at rarely-covered Springsteen songs, today we travel to Norway to appreciate this lovely cover of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/10/31/roll-of-the-dice-the-wrestler/">The Wrestler</a>” by Oslo based electronic-indie-pop-rock duo Lars Sundt and Kent Roise, otherwise known as The Undertaker’s Office.</p>

<p>Lars and Kent’s cover is quiet and pensive like Bruce’s original, but it’s cast in a sparer, piano-centric arrangement with just enough ethereal electronic adornment to highlight rather than distract.</p>
<p>When they released it in 2018, Lars and Kent wrote on their Facebook page that they chose the song because they’re fans of the artist, the song, and the film it was based on, and their reverence for the source material shows.</p>
