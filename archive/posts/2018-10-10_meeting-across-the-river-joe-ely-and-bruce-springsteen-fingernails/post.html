<p>“Fingernails” dates way back to 1978, from Joe Ely’s second album, <em>Honkey Tonk Masquerade. </em>It’s one of the shortest tracks on the record (a mere 2:13), but it’s a honky-tonk rave-up that grows in length, power, and raucousness in its frequent appearances in Joe’s setlists.</p>

<p>Bruce and Joe go way back as well–they’ve been performing on each other’s stages for a quarter of a century, and they played “Fingernails” together back at their very first joint appearance.</p>
<p>Take listen to Bruce cutting loose on guitar during that performance below, captured in great quality from Joe’s show at the National Stadium in Dublin, May 19, 1993.</p>

<p>The pair performed “Fingernails” once more together, and once again it was on Joe’s stage in Dublin (this time at The Mean Fiddler) during a night off on Bruce’s solo, acoustic Ghost of Tom Joad Tour. You can almost hear the joy in Bruce’s electric guitar at being played again–and this time you can hear Bruce on vocals as well.</p>
