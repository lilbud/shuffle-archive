If I had less restraint, I'd probably feature a cover from the outstanding *Play Some Pool, Skip Some School, Act Real Cool* compilation (released back in 2009) at least once a week. There are so many great tracks on that album–I really can't recommend it enough.

(See my previous entry on Jeniferever's [stunning cover](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/11/03/cover-me-jeniferever-one-step-up/) of "[One Step Up](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/08/17/roll-of-the-dice-one-step-up/)" from that compilation.)

Today, the spotlight is on one of my favorites: a gorgeous cello and double bass-led arrangement of "[Darkness on the Edge of Town](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/04/10/roll-of-the-dice-darkness-on-the-edge-of-town/)" by Vatican Cellars.

Vatican Cellars is a five-piece "folk noir" band from the UK, and that's a pretty apt description.

Their subject matter is dark, and their vocals are somber. But oh, those strings... I just lose myself in that bridge every time.

Take a listen and enjoy (and then trust me and get the compilation!)
