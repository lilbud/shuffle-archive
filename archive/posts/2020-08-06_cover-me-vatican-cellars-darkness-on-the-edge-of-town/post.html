<p>If I had less restraint, I’d probably feature a cover from the outstanding <em>Play Some Pool, Skip Some School, Act Real Cool</em> compilation (released back in 2009) at least once a week. There are so many great tracks on that album–I really can’t recommend it enough.</p>
<p>(See my previous entry on Jeniferever’s <a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/11/03/cover-me-jeniferever-one-step-up/">stunning cover</a> of “<a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/08/17/roll-of-the-dice-one-step-up/">One Step Up</a>” from that compilation.)</p>
<p>Today, the spotlight is on one of my favorites: a gorgeous cello and double bass-led arrangement of “<a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/04/10/roll-of-the-dice-darkness-on-the-edge-of-town/">Darkness on the Edge of Town</a>” by Vatican Cellars.</p>

<p>Their subject matter is dark, and their vocals are somber. But oh, those strings… I just lose myself in that bridge every time.</p>
<p>Take a listen and enjoy (and then trust me and get the compilation!)</p>
