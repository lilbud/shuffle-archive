<p>If I had less restraint, I’d probably feature a cover from the outstanding <em>Play Some Pool, Skip Some School, Act Real Cool</em> compilation (released back in 2009) at least once a week. There are so many great tracks on that album–I really can’t recommend it enough.</p>
<p>(See my previous entry on Jeniferever’s <a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/11/03/cover-me-jeniferever-one-step-up/">stunning cover</a> of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/08/17/roll-of-the-dice-one-step-up/">One Step Up</a>” from that compilation.)</p>
<p>Today, the spotlight is on one of my favorites: a gorgeous cello and double bass-led arrangement of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/04/10/roll-of-the-dice-darkness-on-the-edge-of-town/">Darkness on the Edge of Town</a>” by Vatican Cellars.</p>
<p><p><a href="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=136685173/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=3618468140/transparent=true/">Watch Video</a></p> Vatican Cellars is a five-piece “folk noir” band from the UK, and that’s a pretty apt description.</p>
<p>Their subject matter is dark, and their vocals are somber. But oh, those strings… I just lose myself in that bridge every time.</p>
<p>Take a listen and enjoy (and then trust me and get the compilation!)</p>
