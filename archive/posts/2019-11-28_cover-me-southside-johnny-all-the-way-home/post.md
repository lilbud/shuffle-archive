If you only know “” from the album, then you don’t know its original arrangement and best performance.

[All the Way Home](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/09/08/roll-of-the-dice-all-the-way-home/)*Devils & Dust*

From Southside Johnny’s 1991 LP, this is the definitive version of “All the Way Home.” The lyrics are a bit different, but it’s the melody and the band that transform this into powerful romantic ballad.

*Better Days*

(Listen carefully–you’ll hear Bruce on backing vocals and keyboard.)
