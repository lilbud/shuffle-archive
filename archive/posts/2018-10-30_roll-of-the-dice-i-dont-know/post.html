<p>Sometime in the autumn of 1979, at his home in Holmdel, Bruce recorded this little ditty:</p>

<p>What’s it about?</p>
<p>I don’t know!</p>
<p>Sorry, I couldn’t resist. But seriously, I’m not even sure that Bruce knew what it was about. “I Don’t Know” sounds more a melody in search of lyrics. What few lines are intelligible are almost certainly bluffed. Bruce does this often when working on a song–he warps (and sometimes warps) a melody around a turn of phrase that he particularly likes. Sometimes it reflects the heart of the song, other times its just a hook, and I suspect in this case it’s the latter.</p>
<p>“I Don’t Know” doesn’t appear to have evolved into any finished, released Springsteen song–none to which I can trace a genealogical link, anyway.</p>
<p>Might there be a finished version of the song somewhere in the vault?</p>
<p>Perhaps, but baby…</p>
