But seriously, I&#8217;m not even sure that Bruce knew what it was about. &#8220;I Don&#8217;t Know&#8221; sounds more a melody in search of lyrics. What few lines are intelligible are almost certainly bluffed. Bruce does this often when working on a song&#8211;he warps (and sometimes warps) a melody around a turn of phrase that he particularly likes. Sometimes it reflects the heart of the song, other times its just a hook, and I suspect in this case it&#8217;s the latter.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I Don&#8217;t Know&#8221; doesn&#8217;t appear to have evolved into any finished, released Springsteen song&#8211;none to which I can trace a genealogical link, anyway.</p>\n<p>Might there be a finished version of the song somewhere in the vault?</p>\n<p>Perhaps, but baby&#8230;</p>\n<p><strong>I Don&#8217;t Know</strong><br />\n<strong>Recorded: </strong>Autumn 1979 (early demo only)<br />\n<strong>Never performed</strong></p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
