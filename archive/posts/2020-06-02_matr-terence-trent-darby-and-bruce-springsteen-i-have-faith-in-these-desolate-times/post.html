<p>One early summer evening, 27 years ago, Bruce Springsteen invited Terence Trent D’Arby to the stage at his Madison Square Garden benefit show for the Kristen Ann Carr Fund.</p>
<p>This was the song D’Arby sang, from his 1989 album <em>Neither Fish Nor Flesh, </em>gently supported by Bruce and his band:</p>

<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>I have faith in these desolate times</em><br/>
<em>A roar down the road of a rumbling war</em><br/>
<em>I have faith in these desolate times</em><br/>
<em>A chill from the eyes of</em><br/>
<em>a man of political skill</em><br/>
<em>I have faith but for how much longer?</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>It seems to me, bitter trees, full of fleas</em><br/>
<em>Summarily hold the branches</em><br/>
<em>People we, falling leaves, watching thieves</em><br/>
<em>Stealing keys, to our ranches</em><br/>
<em>I have faith in these desolate times</em><br/>
<em>A score to the sound of the feet</em><br/>
<em>of a journeyman’s tour</em><br/>
<em>I have faith in these desolate times</em><br/>
<em>A feel and a hope and belief</em><br/>
<em>that man’s peace will be still</em><br/>
<em>I have faith but for how much longer?</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>The village green, people seen, full of beans</em><br/>
<em>Imagining the course of action</em><br/>
<em>And in between, shopping scenes, plasticine</em><br/>
<em>Suburban dreams, an empty faction</em><br/>
<em>I have faith in these desolate times</em><br/>
<em>Show fear, and the smoke of a gun trigger</em><br/>
<em>pulling finger pressure comes near</em><br/>
<em>I have faith in these desolate times</em><br/>
<em>Before long, the lamb and the lion may lie</em><br/>
<em>with the lass in the grass at dawn</em><br/>
<em>I have faith but for how much longer?</em></p>
<p>As you can hear, D’Arby was roundly booed. Nevertheless, he persisted.</p>
