title: I Have Faith in These Desolate Times
---

One early summer evening, 27 years ago, Bruce Springsteen invited Terence Trent D’Arby to the stage at his Madison Square Garden benefit show for the Kristen Ann Carr Fund.

This was the song D’Arby sang, from his 1989 album gently supported by Bruce and his band:

*Neither Fish Nor Flesh,*

*I have faith in these desolate times*  
*A roar down the road of a rumbling war*  
*I have faith in these desolate times*  
*A chill from the eyes of*  
*a man of political skill*  
*I have faith but for how much longer?*



*It seems to me, bitter trees, full of fleas*  
*Summarily hold the branches*  
*People we, falling leaves, watching thieves*  
*Stealing keys, to our ranches*  
*I have faith in these desolate times*  
*A score to the sound of the feet*  
*of a journeyman’s tour*  
*I have faith in these desolate times*  
*A feel and a hope and belief*  
*that man’s peace will be still*  
*I have faith but for how much longer?*



*The village green, people seen, full of beans*  
*Imagining the course of action*  
*And in between, shopping scenes, plasticine*  
*Suburban dreams, an empty faction*  
*I have faith in these desolate times*  
*Show fear, and the smoke of a gun trigger*  
*pulling finger pressure comes near*  
*I have faith in these desolate times*  
*Before long, the lamb and the lion may lie*  
*with the lass in the grass at dawn*  
*I have faith but for how much longer?*

As you can hear, D’Arby was roundly booed. Nevertheless, he persisted.

In these desolate times, have faith.

And persist.
