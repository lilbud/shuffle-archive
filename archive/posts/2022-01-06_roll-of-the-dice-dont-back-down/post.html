We’ve listened to many of them here over the past four years, and we’ll listen to more before we bring this journey to a close.</p>
<p>“Don’t Back Down” is one of those coulda-been-a-contender songs, if only Bruce had finished it. Or maybe he did… studio records indicate he recorded a full-band version in June 1983 that remains unheard to this day.</p>
<p>The challenge is that we don’t know which “Don’t Back Down” he recorded.</p>
<p>Bruce actually had two different works-in progress by that name during the <em>Born in the U.S.A.</em> sessions, and an astonishing dozen different takes circulate on bootleg recordings. But here’s the interesting thing: eleven of those twelve songs use a common set of lyrics, but one of the twelve is completely unique in both words and music.</p>
<p>We’ll listen to the other eleven later this year. Today, we’re interested in the odd man out.</p>
<p>This version of “Don’t Back Down” is truly a separate song from the others, but it held just as much promise. Take a listen to the home demo below–it’s just Bruce accompanied by a drum machine, but the arrangement is complete enough for us to get a sense of what an E Street Band track might have sounded like.</p>

<p>Lyrically, this version of “Don’t Back Down” is still a work in progress–the third verse is just the first verse repeated and there are a few lines that sound at least lightly bluffed–but this is definitely a fully formed pop song with verses in the mold of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/05/28/roll-of-the-dice-two-hearts/">Two Hearts</a>” and a refrain reminiscent of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/11/18/roll-of-the-dice-no-surrender/">No Surrender</a>.”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>If you’re out on your own and you ain’t got a home</em><br/>
<em>And it feels like the whole world’s just gonna fall on you</em><br/>
<em>You’re just running scared, look around, there’s nothing there</em><br/>
<em>And you ain’t got the strength and your friends all just stall on you</em><br/>
<em>Well, along comes a cloud, and you’re lost in the crowd</em><br/>
<em>Once you thought you might make it, but babe, these days you doubt it</em><br/>
<em>If you need a hand, honey, I understand</em><br/>
<em>Just stand on up, yeah, stand up and shout it girl</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Don’t back down, don’t back down</em><br/>
<em>Don’t back down, don’t back down</em><br/>
<em>Don’t back down, don’t back down</em><br/>
<em>Don’t back down, don’t back down</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Now you see all the ones worn out and tired</em><br/>
<em>There’s a fool all broken down by the wayside</em><br/>
<em>Where two hearts call out for hire</em><br/>
<em>Filled with hurt, defeated by their foolish pride</em><br/>
<em>Girl, you hear the sound of one comin’ down</em><br/>
<em>And you don’t think that these days you can make it, babe</em><br/>
<em>Just step on up, I’ll give a hand</em><br/>
<em>And if you ain’t got a problem, maybe we can shed it, baby</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Don’t back down, don’t back down</em><br/>
<em>Don’t back down, don’t back down</em><br/>
<em>Don’t back down, don’t back down</em><br/>
<em>Don’t back down, don’t back down</em></p>
<p>These aren’t Bruce’s deepest lyrics, but with a hook like that and a beat that doesn’t let up for even a moment’s breath, “Don’t Back Down” didn’t need depth to be a hit.</p>
<p>Is there a killer pop song in the vault called “Don’t Back Down,”  just waiting for Bruce to get around to issuing that <em>Born in the U.S.A.</em> anniversary box set? Only time will tell. But even if we do get an official release someday, the question remains: which “Don’t Back Down” will it be?</p>
