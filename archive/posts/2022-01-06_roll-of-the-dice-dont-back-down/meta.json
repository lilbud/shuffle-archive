We&#8217;ve listened to many of them here over the past four years, and we&#8217;ll listen to more before we bring this journey to a close.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t Back Down&#8221; is one of those coulda-been-a-contender songs, if only Bruce had finished it. Or maybe he did&#8230; studio records indicate he recorded a full-band version in June 1983 that remains unheard to this day.</p>\n<p>The challenge is that we don&#8217;t know which &#8220;Don&#8217;t Back Down&#8221; he recorded.</p>\n<p>Bruce actually had two different works-in progress by that name during the <em>Born in the U.S.A.</em> sessions, and an astonishing dozen different takes circulate on bootleg recordings. But here&#8217;s the interesting thing: eleven of those twelve songs use a common set of lyrics, but one of the twelve is completely unique in both words and music.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll listen to the other eleven later this year. Today, we&#8217;re interested in the odd man out.</p>\n<p>This version of &#8220;Don&#8217;t Back Down&#8221; is truly a separate song from the others, but it held just as much promise. Take a listen to the home demo below&#8211;it&#8217;s just Bruce accompanied by a drum machine, but the arrangement is complete enough for us to get a sense of what an E Street Band track might have sounded like.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen Don&#039;t Back Down #10 different music &amp; double track vocals\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/omkVpmMkLOY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Lyrically, this version of &#8220;Don&#8217;t Back Down&#8221; is still a work in progress&#8211;the third verse is just the first verse repeated and there are a few lines that sound at least lightly bluffed&#8211;but this is definitely a fully formed pop song with verses in the mold of &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/05/28/roll-of-the-dice-two-hearts/\">Two Hearts</a>&#8221; and a refrain reminiscent of &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/11/18/roll-of-the-dice-no-surrender/\">No Surrender</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>If you&#8217;re out on your own and you ain&#8217;t got a home</em><br />\n<em>And it feels like the whole world&#8217;s just gonna fall on you</em><br />\n<em>You&#8217;re just running scared, look around, there&#8217;s nothing there</em><br />\n<em>And you ain&#8217;t got the strength and your friends all just stall on you</em><br />\n<em>Well, along comes a cloud, and you&#8217;re lost in the crowd</em><br />\n<em>Once you thought you might make it, but babe, these days you doubt it</em><br />\n<em>If you need a hand, honey, I understand</em><br />\n<em>Just stand on up, yeah, stand up and shout it girl</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Don&#8217;t back down, don&#8217;t back down</em><br />\n<em>Don&#8217;t back down, don&#8217;t back down</em><br />\n<em>Don&#8217;t back down, don&#8217;t back down</em><br />\n<em>Don&#8217;t back down, don&#8217;t back down</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Now you see all the ones worn out and tired</em><br />\n<em>There&#8217;s a fool all broken down by the wayside</em><br />\n<em>Where two hearts call out for hire</em><br />\n<em>Filled with hurt, defeated by their foolish pride</em><br />\n<em>Girl, you hear the sound of one comin&#8217; down</em><br />\n<em>And you don&#8217;t think that these days you can make it, babe</em><br />\n<em>Just step on up, I&#8217;ll give a hand</em><br />\n<em>And if you ain&#8217;t got a problem, maybe we can shed it, baby</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Don&#8217;t back down, don&#8217;t back down</em><br />\n<em>Don&#8217;t back down, don&#8217;t back down</em><br />\n<em>Don&#8217;t back down, don&#8217;t back down</em><br />\n<em>Don&#8217;t back down, don&#8217;t back down</em></p>\n<p>These aren&#8217;t Bruce&#8217;s deepest lyrics, but with a hook like that and a beat that doesn&#8217;t let up for even a moment&#8217;s breath, &#8220;Don&#8217;t Back Down&#8221; didn&#8217;t need depth to be a hit.</p>\n<p>Is there a killer pop song in the vault called &#8220;Don&#8217;t Back Down,&#8221;\u00a0 just waiting for Bruce to get around to issuing that\u00a0<em>Born in the U.S.A.</em> anniversary box set?
