Rock&#8221; is crunchy and catchy, playfully and powerfully personal.</p>\n<p>And unlike many of Joe&#8217;s songs we&#8217;ve listened to here on the Shuffle, this one is 100% Grushecky&#8211;no Springsteen co-writer credit here.</p>\n<p>But with a title like &#8220;I Was Born to Rock&#8221; and team-ups so frequent they already number more than fifty, it was probably inevitable that Bruce would join Joe on stage for it if not in the studio.</p>\n<p>That moment came in May 2014, when Bruce joined Joe for a pair of Pittsburgh shows immediately following the High Hopes Tour. &#8220;I Was Born to Rock&#8221; came out for the encores, and while Bruce only supports on guitar and backing vocals, it was a roaring performance and an encore highlight.</p>\n<p>Take a listen below and enjoy Joe and Bruce&#8217;s only team-up to date on &#8220;I Was Born to Rock.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"v-TTD71Lro-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress
