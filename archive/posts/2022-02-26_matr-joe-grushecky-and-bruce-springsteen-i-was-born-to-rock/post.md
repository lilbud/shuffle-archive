If every rocker needs a mission statement, for Joe Grushecky, "I Was Born to Rock" is a pretty great candidate.

Tucked deep into Joe's otherwise weighty *Somewhere East of Eden* album (his seventeenth studio album, released in 2013), "I Was Born to Rock" is crunchy and catchy, playfully and powerfully personal.

And unlike many of Joe's songs we've listened to here on the Shuffle, this one is 100% Grushecky–no Springsteen co-writer credit here.

But with a title like "I Was Born to Rock" and team-ups so frequent they already number more than fifty, it was probably inevitable that Bruce would join Joe on stage for it if not in the studio.

That moment came in May 2014, when Bruce joined Joe for a pair of Pittsburgh shows immediately following the High Hopes Tour. "I Was Born to Rock" came out for the encores, and while Bruce only supports on guitar and backing vocals, it was a roaring performance and an encore highlight.

Take a listen below and enjoy Joe and Bruce's only team-up to date on "I Was Born to Rock."
