Every week brings a new wave of Springsteen covers, and I try to watch them all.

The vast majority of them are just what you’d expect: a fan in home studio paying tribute to their idol in passable but unremarkable fashion. I watch them once and then move on to the next. But when I find the rare gem, I bring it to your attention here.

Today’s entry is a bona fide diamond.

Jake Thistle may only be fifteen years old, but the New Jersey teen is already a remarkably talented musician working on his first EP. And if his cover of Bruce’s “” (in its original Christic arrangement) is anything to judge by, he’s got a great career ahead of him.

Watch this one–it’s an amazingly heartfelt and accomplished performance.

There aren’t many covers of this particular song out there, but I have a feeling Jake’s version would be at the top of the heap even if there were.
