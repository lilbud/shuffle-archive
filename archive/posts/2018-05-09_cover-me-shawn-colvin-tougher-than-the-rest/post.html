<p>It’s a gorgeous performance that captures the soul of the song. As she said in an <a href="https://www.npr.org/2015/09/26/442917037/we-all-have-something-to-say-shawn-colvin-on-the-value-of-cover-songs">NPR interview</a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>It’s mistaken, perhaps, for a song that’s got a lot of bravado in it, and I don’t see it that way. I see it as world-weariness that he’s conveying, and sort of a quiet confidence, born of struggle and experience and heartbreak. </em></p>
