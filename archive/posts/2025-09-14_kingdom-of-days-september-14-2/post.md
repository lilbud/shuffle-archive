**2003:** At his Rising show in Chapel Hill, Bruce finally starts acknowledging his TOL/HT/LT era, tour premiering “[Brilliant Disguise,](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/02/06/roll-of-the-dice-brilliant-disguise/)” and “[Living Proof](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/03/18/roll-of-the-dice-living-proof/),” the latter of which is its first E Street Band performance. The trend will continue throughout the rest of the tour, perhaps not coincidentally while *The Essential Bruce Springsteen* compilation is in production.
