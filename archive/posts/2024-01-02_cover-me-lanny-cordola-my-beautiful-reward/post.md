Sometimes a wonderful cover can fly completely under the radar.

This is one of them.

Lanny Cordola has associated himself with a few bands over the years, but he’s a wonderful musician in his own right. (He plays every instrument you hear on this track.)

His 2001 spin on “” is original in sound but true in spirit to the original; it’s more reflective and atmospheric than Bruce’s album version, and his vocals and arrangement really bring out the narrative.

This is very well done.
