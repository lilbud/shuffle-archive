Determined to impress her with a life of luxury beyond what he could afford in the big city, Brandhoefer moved to the town of Ogallala, where land was cheap and plentiful.</p>\n<p>Ogallala was a baby town at the time&#8211;nowhere near the bustling metropolis of over 5,000 people it is today. Brandhoefer knew that if he and his intended were going to live a comfortable life, he&#8217;d need to help jumpstart the town. He ran for mayor and was elected, started a bank and a lumber business, and then he started construction on the house that he intended as a wedding gift for his beloved.</p>\n<p>And oh, what a home. He hired the best builders available from back in Chicago and (relatively) nearby Denver; he sourced the highest-quality materials New Jersey had to offer.</p>\n<p>The finished three-story, red brick Victorian home had ten-foot ceilings, sixteen-inch thick walls, two hand-carved cherry fireplaces, beautiful walnut windows, two in-home bathrooms (almost unheard of at the time), running water with a reservoir, and a plethora of beautiful and tasteful touches throughout.</p>\n<p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-attachment-id=\"33147\" data-permalink=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/03/06/roll-of-the-dice-mansion-on-the-hill/170628_mansion-on-the-hill_ogallala_ajd_9331-2-scaled/#main\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/170628_Mansion-on-the-Hill_Ogallala_AJD_9331-2-scaled-1.jpg?fit=2560%2C1586&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2560,1586\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;9&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;AJ Dahm&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Canon EOS 5DS R&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;Mansion on the Hill-Ogallala, NE\\rWayne Fester-tour guide\\rshed outside was from Lemoyne, NE&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1498616999&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;24&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;100&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.004&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"170628_Mansion-on-the-Hill_Ogallala_AJD_9331-2-scaled\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/170628_Mansion-on-the-Hill_Ogallala_AJD_9331-2-scaled-1.jpg?fit=300%2C186&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/170628_Mansion-on-the-Hill_Ogallala_AJD_9331-2-scaled-1.jpg?fit=758%2C469&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-33147\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/170628_Mansion-on-the-Hill_Ogallala_AJD_9331-2-scaled-1.jpg?resize=758%2C470&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"758\" height=\"470\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/170628_Mansion-on-the-Hill_Ogallala_AJD_9331-2-scaled-1.jpg?w=2560&amp;ssl=1 2560w, https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/170628_Mansion-on-the-Hill_Ogallala_AJD_9331-2-scaled-1.jpg?resize=300%2C186&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/170628_Mansion-on-the-Hill_Ogallala_AJD_9331-2-scaled-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C634&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/170628_Mansion-on-the-Hill_Ogallala_AJD_9331-2-scaled-1.jpg?resize=768%2C476&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/170628_Mansion-on-the-Hill_Ogallala_AJD_9331-2-scaled-1.jpg?resize=1536%2C952&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/170628_Mansion-on-the-Hill_Ogallala_AJD_9331-2-scaled-1.jpg?resize=2048%2C1269&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/170628_Mansion-on-the-Hill_Ogallala_AJD_9331-2-scaled-1.jpg?w=2274&amp;ssl=1 2274w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 758px) 100vw, 758px\" /></p>\n<p>Situated at the hilltop corner of 10th and Spruce Streets, the Mansion on the Hill (as it came to be called) loomed over the town of Ogallala as a symbol of luxury and prosperity. Satisfied that he&#8217;d built the perfect wedding house, he returned to Chicago to share the news with his beloved.</p>\n<p>But his beloved had betrothed another.</p>\n<p>Absent for too long, Brandhoefer was now left with his perfect home and no one to share it with. Devastated, he couldn&#8217;t bear to move into it, so he sold it and the house became known as &#8220;Heartbreak House,&#8221; and then later, &#8220;The Mansion on the Hill.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Eighty years after Brandhoefer sold his heartbreak house, the great American singer-songwriter Hank Williams wrote a song called, &#8220;A Mansion on the Hill,&#8221; with lyrics that would have hit Brandhoefer pretty close to home had he still been alive.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Hank Williams - Mansion On The Hill (ORIGINAL) -  (1947).\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pKKSMIwKfvQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Tonight down here in the valley</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;m lonesome and O how I feel</em><br />\n<em>As I sit here alone in my cabin</em><br />\n<em>I can see your mansion on the hill</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Do you recall when we parted</em><br />\n<em>The story to me you revealed</em><br />\n<em>You said you could live without loving</em><br />\n<em>In your loveless mansion on the hill</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I&#8217;ve waited all through the years love</em><br />\n<em>To give you a heart true and real</em><br />\n<em>Cause I know you&#8217;re living in sorrow</em><br />\n<em>In your loveless mansion on the hill</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>The light shine bright from yer window</em><br />\n<em>The trees stand so silent and still</em><br />\n<em>I know you&#8217;re alone with your pride dear</em><br />\n<em>In your loveless mansion on the hill</em></p>\n<p>If something in your brain tugged at you while reading those lyrics, there&#8217;s a good reason for that. While it&#8217;s pretty commonly acknowledged that Bruce Springsteen lifted the title from Hank&#8217;s 1947 recording for a song he recorded for his 1982 <em>Nebraska</em> album, Williams&#8217; influence goes way beyond the song&#8217;s name.</p>\n<p>Bruce took the entire song structure and meter from Williams, and even the &#8220;silent and still&#8221; lyric. And while he substantially changed the melodic elements, it&#8217;s still almost impossible to listen to Hank&#8217;s and Bruce&#8217;s recordings and not hear the other reflected.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Mansion On the Hill\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fxsHA0M8gtM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Thematically, Williams&#8217; wistful break-up song is very different from Bruce&#8217;s childhood reminiscence. Both, however, employ the mansion as metaphor for a life that seems unattainable to their narrators.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s not a coincidence. Bruce was deep into his fascination with Williams during the Darkness era in which his &#8220;Mansion on the Hill&#8221; originates, and his 1982 recording owes so much to Williams that a plausible argument could almost be made for Williams as co-writer.</p>\n<p>But while Bruce may owe his central conceit and construction to Hank, the story he tells is all is own. On first listen, &#8220;Mansion on the Hill&#8221; is a straightforward ballad, a nostalgic memory of the town the narrator grew up in. There&#8217;s a twist at the end, though&#8211;one that sheds light on its author&#8217;s frame of mind at that particular moment in his life, and one that&#8217;s sly enough to escape us if we&#8217;re not paying attention, so let&#8217;s pay attention now and take a deep listen.</p>\n<p>In his first two verses, Bruce establishes the metaphor: a grand house surrounded by gates of hardened steel&#8211;the symbol of a life off-limits and unattainable to those not born into it.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>There&#8217;s a place out on the edge of town, sir</em><br />\n<em>Rising above the factories and the fields</em><br />\n<em>Now ever since I was a child I can remember</em><br />\n<em>That mansion on the hill</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>In the day you can see the children playing</em><br />\n<em>On the road that leads to those gates of hardened steel</em><br />\n<em>Steel gates that completely surround, sir</em><br />\n<em>The mansion on the hill</em></p>\n<p>The house stands above the factories and the fields, always visible to the workers below. Children play on the road that leads to it, but they&#8217;re never allowed inside.</p>\n<p>The mansion is a source of mystery and fascination. Behind its gates, inside its walls, there&#8217;s music, light, and laughter&#8211;the elements of an easy life, free of care and trouble. (The phrase, &#8220;people laughing all the time&#8221; is key&#8211;it&#8217;s how we know this vignette strikes a deeper chord with the narrator than he otherwise reveals.) The lively mansion grounds stand in stark contrast to the somber, silent and still streets of the town.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>At night my daddy&#8217;d take me and we&#8217;d ride</em><br />\n<em>Through the streets of a town so silent and still</em><br />\n<em>Park on a back road along the highway side</em><br />\n<em>Look up at that mansion on the hill</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>In the summer all the lights would shine</em><br />\n<em>There&#8217;d be music playing, people laughing all the time</em><br />\n<em>Me and my sister we&#8217;d hide out in the tall corn fields</em><br />\n<em>Sit and listen to the mansion on the hill</em></p>\n<p>In a nightly ritual, father and son spend their summer evenings looking up at the mansion, imagining an unimaginable life. There&#8217;s an implicit statement here, one that recurs often in Bruce&#8217;s work: as it is with the father, so shall it be with the son. (We&#8217;ll witness a similar ritual a year or so later in &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/04/09/roll-of-the-dice-my-hometown/\">My Hometown</a>.&#8221;) Our narrator is destined to live his life on the outside of those gates, just like his father before him.</p>\n<p>Or is he?</p>\n<p>Because in his last verse, the famously specific songwriter introduces just enough ambiguity to make us wonder.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Tonight down here in Linden Town</em><br />\n<em>I watch the cars rushing by home from the mill</em><br />\n<em>There&#8217;s a beautiful full moon rising</em><br />\n<em>Above the mansion on the hill</em></p>\n<p>There are two ways to hear this verse. Common to both of them is a flash forward to the present&#8211;we&#8217;re now listening to the grown narrator at the end of a working day.\u00a0But is he following in his father&#8217;s footsteps, a worker looking up at the mansion from down in the town, dreaming of a life of luxury? Or is he now the man in the mansion, far removed from his beginnings but unable to forget them?</p>\n<p>When Bruce recorded &#8220;Mansion on the Hill&#8221; in the winter of 1981-82, he had just finished the year-long River Tour that established him as a bona fide global star. Still very much identifying with his blue collar origins, Bruce was beginning to get a sense of life in the mansion, and that transition was evincing itself in his lyrics&#8211;something he seemed to directly acknowledge when he introduced the song before its live debut in 1984.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen Mansion on the Hill St Paul 29/06/1984\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9gnfbb5m_Yw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Bruce played &#8220;Mansion on the Hill&#8221; frequently during those first years of financial security, an odd set list choice given the quiet intimacy of the song and the ever-increasing size of his audiences and venues.
