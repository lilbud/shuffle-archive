**2012:** An amazing Wrecking Ball show in Barcelona, where the tour premieres (“[Hungry Heart](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/12/21/roll-of-the-dice-hungry-heart/)” and “Y[ou Can Look (But You Better Not Touch)](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/06/14/roll-of-the-dice-you-can-look-but-you-better-not-touch/)” are the least of the highlights. This show will be remembered as the night when the legendary extended instrumental intro to “[Prove It All Night](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/10/24/roll-of-the-dice-prove-it-all-night/)” from the Darkness Tour finally returned–by request–after being absent for 32 years.

**2014:** The first night of a jaw-dropping two-night closing stand for the High Hopes Tour in an unusual venue: the Mohegan Sun Casino in Uncasville, Connecticut. The set list features an embarrassment of riches from the opening “[Racing in the Street ’78](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/10/03/roll-of-the-dice-racing-in-the-street/)” to the tour premiere of “[The Price You Pay](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/09/23/roll-of-the-dice-the-price-you-pay/)” and “[Quarter to Three](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/08/21/cover-me-quarter-to-three/)” to the closing “Thunder Road.” Little Steven makes his unannounced and triumphant return to the band for these last two shows.

**2016:** *The River* tracks still dominate the set list as the European leg gathers steam, but there’s still plenty of room for tour premieres: “[Fire](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/08/05/roll-of-the-dice-fire/),” “[Murder Incorporated](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/04/19/roll-of-the-dice-murder-incorporated/),” “[Waitin’ on a Sunny Day](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/09/27/roll-of-the-dice-waitin-on-a-sunny-day/)” and a solo acoustic “This Hard Land” all make their debut in San Sebastian.
