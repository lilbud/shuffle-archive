That is, until he shot and killed James in order to claim the reward that had been placed on James&#8217; head. Although ostensibly on the side of justice, Ford became painted as the villain as James became a Robin Hood-style martyr. Ford wandered the West ever after until he was himself shot dead at the age of 30.</p>\n<p>Bruce found biblical parallels in the story of Robert and Jesse, as we&#8217;ll shortly see. But in the first verse, the parallels we see are to another Springsteen original, one that very much would see the light of day shortly:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>It was a sunny afternoon down at the ??? shack</em><br />\n<em>And Robert ran for amnesty, shot Jesse in the back</em><br />\n<em>Bobby, he ran to Maria, but the freedom he gained from his sins</em><br />\n<em>She said Bobby, oh Bobby what have you done</em><br />\n<em>And she would not let him in</em></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not much of a stretch to connect the dots between &#8220;Robert Ford&#8221; and &#8220;Highway Patrolman.&#8221; Both songs chronicle a strained brotherhood, both include a love interest named Maria (who as far as I know is Bruce&#8217;s invention, not an actual historical figure). I&#8217;ve read accounts that laud &#8220;Highway Patrolman&#8221; as a leap in Bruce&#8217;s storytelling that seems to have come from nowhere; I suspect it was inspired by the story of Robert Ford and Jesse James. (I&#8217;ll write more about that someday when the dice direct me to that song.)</p>\n<p>As the song continues, Ford gives way to outrage. Ford becomes a pariah, &#8220;branded&#8221; among the cattle and cursed to wander the country. If that sounds more than a little like the story of Cain and Abel, that&#8217;s certainly not accidental: Ford is clearly a Cain figure, marked and destined for loneliness.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>He swore he&#8217;d never hang his head in shame</em><br />\n<em>And so he rode with his gun in his hand</em><br />\n<em>Everywhere across the land people came</em><br />\n<em>To meet the man who shot Jesse James</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Branded, branded down among the cattle</em><br />\n<em>He made his bed from a rock on the mountainside</em><br />\n<em>Stood on the banks of his old world</em><br />\n<em>Hung his head and cried</em></p>\n<p>The final verses are a bit hard to make out at times&#8211;the song was still unfinished, remember&#8211;but once again, we hear echoes of another Springsteen original. Only this one wouldn&#8217;t see the light of day for more than a quarter century:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>He was killed when he lied of all of the ???</em><br />\n<em>Who was just out to make himself a name</em><br />\n<em><strong>He lays in the blood dying in the sun</strong></em><br />\n<em>And in his mind, he dreamed my way again</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well then he lay down ???</em><br />\n<em>He spoke aloud as if trying every word</em><br />\n<em>Well then I heard Jesse saying to himself</em><br />\n<em><strong>I&#8217;m sorry for what I&#8217;ve done</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Those lines</strong> are too close to a key couplet in &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/12/29/roll-of-the-dice-outlaw-pete/\">Outlaw Pete</a>&#8221; to be coincidence:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Dan smiled as he lay in his own blood dying in the sun</em><br />\n<em>And whispered in Pete&#8217;s ear, &#8220;We cannot undo these things we&#8217;ve done.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>It may not have been a conscious recycling choice, but it had to have been at least a subconscious one. The imagery of Ford shooting James in the back, James dying in the sun, and the theme of repentance that comes too late&#8211;these are all key elements that obviously registered and resonated deeply with Bruce.</p>\n<p>Fascinatingly, even though we know &#8220;Robert Ford&#8221; never made it to <em>Nebraska</em>, surviving records indicate that Bruce did record at least one take of a full-band arrangement with the E Street Band in April 1982. If so, it remains securely in the vault without even a hint of an escaped bootleg.\u00a0 Let&#8217;s hope we get to hear it someday when Bruce releases his next wave of outtakes.</p>\n<p><strong>Bonus:\u00a0</strong>here&#8217;s one more demo take of &#8220;Robert Ford&#8221; &#8212; no lyrics in this one, though, only harmonies.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen Jesse James #2 harmonies\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-0wiyoQIBYg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><strong>Robert Ford</strong><br />\n<strong>Recorded:</strong> September 1981 &#8211; April 1982<br />\n<strong>Never released</strong><br />\n<strong>Never performed</strong></p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
