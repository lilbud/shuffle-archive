<p>By now you my motto when it comes to covers: Do it better, or do it different.</p>
<p>Self-described “melancholy lo-fi indie” band The Boombox Hearts takes the latter route with “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/01/13/roll-of-the-dice-cover-me/">Cover Me</a>,” but it’s pretty darn good, too.</p>
<p>“Cover Me” is at heart a sad song, right from the opening lines, and the Boombox Hearts well capture that sense of longing for connection in a rough and tumble world.</p>
<p>Plus: when’s the last time you heard someone add a trombone solo when covering a Springsteen song?</p>
