By now you my motto when it comes to covers: Do it better, or do it different.

Self-described "melancholy lo-fi indie" band The Boombox Hearts takes the latter route with "[Cover Me](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/01/13/roll-of-the-dice-cover-me/)," but it's pretty darn good, too.

"Cover Me" is at heart a sad song, right from the opening lines, and the Boombox Hearts well capture that sense of longing for connection in a rough and tumble world.

Plus: when's the last time you heard someone add a trombone solo when covering a Springsteen song?
