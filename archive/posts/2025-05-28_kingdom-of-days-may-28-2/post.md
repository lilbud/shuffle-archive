**2012:** Bruce headlines Pinkpop for the second time, playing a festival set with a Garland Jeffreys guest appearance for “[96 Tears](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/02/15/matr-bruce-springsteen-and-garland-jeffreys-96-tears/)” and Mumford & Sons for “[Hungry Heart.](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/12/21/roll-of-the-dice-hungry-heart/)” The Mumford appearance is not pre-arranged, though–the band is shocked when Bruce beckons them on stage, and Marcus Mumford clearly doesn’t know the words to the song (which he’ll completely own up to with Jimmy Fallon years later–you can watch that below, too).
