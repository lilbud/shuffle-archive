When Eddie “Kingfish” Manion chose a Springsteen song to cover on his 2015 album, *Nightlife*, he went deep, *deep* into the obscure recesses of Bruce’s catalog.

That’s okay, though: if anyone’s entitled to claim a Springsteen rarity, it would be Manion, who not only toured extensively with Bruce as part of the E Street Horns, but also as a member of the Sessions Band, the Miami Horns, and the Horns of Love (not to mention his founding member status in the Asbury Jukes and Little Steven’s Disciples of Soul).

All in all, Manion has performed with Bruce over 350 times across five decades, so yeah… he’s pretty familiar with Bruce’s catalog.

On *Nightlife,* not only does Eddie give us a superb instrumental cover of Bruce’s “[City of Night](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/06/28/roll-of-the-dice-city-of-night/)” (which even Bruce hasn’t performed live), he’s mashed it seamlessly with King Curtis’ “Soul Serenade” for a superb pairing.

Here’s hoping we see Eddie back on the road again with the E Street Band, Sessions Band, or *any* band soon.
