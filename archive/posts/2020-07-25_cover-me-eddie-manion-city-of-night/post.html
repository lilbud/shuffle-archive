<p>That’s okay, though: if anyone’s entitled to claim a Springsteen rarity, it would be Manion, who not only toured extensively with Bruce as part of the E Street Horns, but also as a member of the Sessions Band, the Miami Horns, and the Horns of Love (not to mention his founding member status in the Asbury Jukes and Little Steven’s Disciples of Soul).</p>
<p>All in all, Manion has performed with Bruce over 350 times across five decades, so yeah… he’s pretty familiar with Bruce’s catalog.</p>
<p>On <em>Nightlife, </em>not only does Eddie give us a superb instrumental cover of Bruce’s “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/06/28/roll-of-the-dice-city-of-night/">City of Night</a>” (which even Bruce hasn’t performed live), he’s mashed it seamlessly with King Curtis’ “Soul Serenade” for a superb pairing.</p>

<p>Here’s hoping we see Eddie back on the road again with the E Street Band, Sessions Band, or <em>any</em> band soon.</p>
