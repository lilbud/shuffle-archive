A lot of guys don&#8217;t understand that. Bruce Springsteen was the only guy who accurately expressed what that song was about. It&#8217;s &#8220;I roam from town to town and go through life without a care, I&#8217;m as happy as a clown with my two fists of iron, but I&#8217;m going nowhere.&#8221; In the Fifties, you didn&#8217;t get that dark. It sounds like a lot of fun but it&#8217;s about going nowhere.&#8221; &#8212; Dion DiMucci</span></p></blockquote>\n<p>Dion&#8217;s &#8220;The Wanderer&#8221; was an immediate hit upon its release in late 1961, peaking just one spot shy of the top of U.S. charts, #10 in the U.K., and at #1 in Australia.</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXqWCeB8Vto</p>\n<p>Dion has referred to &#8220;The Wanderer&#8221; as &#8220;Black music filtered through an Italian neighborhood that comes out with an attitude,&#8221; so it&#8217;s no wonder that Bruce would eventually gravitate to it.</p>\n<p>Still, while Bruce has performed the song on stage several times over the years, it took him until 2009 to do so with the E Street Band.</p>\n<p>Bruce&#8217;s first run at the song was way back in 1982, during one of his &#8220;open secret&#8221; Stone Pony gigs with Cats on a Smooth Surface.</p>\n<div id=\"v-y2WUEbRW-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='426' src='https://videopress.com/embed/y2WUEbRW?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>The next time Bruce played &#8220;The Wanderer,&#8221; it was with such a stellar assemblage of talent that the camera doesn&#8217;t even register his presence.
