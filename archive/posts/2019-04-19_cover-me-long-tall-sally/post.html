<p>Is there anyone Bruce <em>hasn’t</em> played “Long Tall Sally” with?</p>
<p>It sure doesn’t seem like it.</p>
<p>He played it in New Jersey clubs throughout 1982 with artists like John Eddie and Cats on a Smooth Surface. On one summer night, he even played a rockabilly version with Stray Cats.</p>

<p>It seems Bruce is always at the ready for “Long Tall Sally,” and how could he not be? We’re talking about a song originally recorded by Little Richard and covered by Elvis Presley, The Kinks, and The Beatles before Bruce ever learned to play the guitar.</p>

<p>“Long Tall Sally” has to be imprinted on Bruce’s musical DNA by now, and if you’re lucky enough to catch him at an impromptu guest appearance, there’s a decent chance you’ll get to see why.</p>
