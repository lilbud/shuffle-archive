Is there anyone Bruce *hasn’t* played “Long Tall Sally” with?

It sure doesn’t seem like it.

He played it in New Jersey clubs throughout 1982 with artists like John Eddie and Cats on a Smooth Surface. On one summer night, he even played a rockabilly version with Stray Cats.

He played a slower, horn-fueled version with La Bamba in 1989…

…and a faster, horn-fueled version with the Max Weinberg 7:

He’s played it with Hall of Famers…

And oh yeah, he’s even played it with these guys:

It seems Bruce is always at the ready for “Long Tall Sally,” and how could he not be? We’re talking about a song originally recorded by Little Richard and covered by Elvis Presley, The Kinks, and The Beatles before Bruce ever learned to play the guitar.

“Long Tall Sally” has to be imprinted on Bruce’s musical DNA by now, and if you’re lucky enough to catch him at an impromptu guest appearance, there’s a decent chance you’ll get to see why.
