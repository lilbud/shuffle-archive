But there are a few bands out there keeping rockabilly alive, and one of them hails from Pottsville, just an hour’s drive from Asbury Park.</p>
<p>The Razorbacks released their live album, <em>Home of the Razorbacks</em>, way back in 2001, and they opened both their set and the CD with their deservedly confident cover of “Stand On It.”</p>

<p>The Razorbacks are still touring (or at least they were, pre-COVID), so keep an eye out when the dust clears–you might be able to catch this one live.</p>
