For a classic rock song that he clearly knows by heart and enjoys singing, it’s surprising that Bruce doesn’t cover Van Morrison’s “Brown Eyed Girl” more often.

Check it out: no teleprompter in sight during this impromptu, by-request performance from 2014:

“Brown Eyed Girl” is one of rock’s most-recognized songs, peaking at #10 but enduring across the decades both in its original form and as countless covers–and always an irresistible singalong.

But even though Bruce has performed it a dozen times over the years, only three of them were at his own shows. Eight of the others were during guest appearances with Joe Grushecky, and the other was a one-off at the Wonder Bar with Timepiece (Patti’s brother’s band).

…and then there’s the most recent performance from Adelaide in 2017, in which… well, I’m just gonna leave it right here. An explanation would just ruin it.
