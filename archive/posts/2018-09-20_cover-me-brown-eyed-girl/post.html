<p>For a classic rock song that he clearly knows by heart and enjoys singing, it’s surprising that Bruce doesn’t cover Van Morrison’s “Brown Eyed Girl” more often.</p>
<p>Check it out: no teleprompter in sight during this impromptu, by-request performance from 2014:</p>

<p>“Brown Eyed Girl” is one of rock’s most-recognized songs, peaking at #10 but enduring across the decades both in its original form and as countless covers–and always an irresistible singalong.</p>

<p>But even though Bruce has performed it a dozen times over the years, only three of them were at his own shows. Eight of the others were during guest appearances with Joe Grushecky, and the other was  a one-off at the Wonder Bar with Timepiece (Patti’s brother’s band).</p>
