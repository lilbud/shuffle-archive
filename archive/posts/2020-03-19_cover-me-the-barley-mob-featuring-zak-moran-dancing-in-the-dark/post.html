<p>The Barley Mob are a six-member rock band from Ireland, and if their name strikes you as a play on the name of a certain beloved artist, well let’s just say the band’s influences show in their terrific cover of Bruce’s “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/12/25/roll-of-the-dice-dancing-in-the-dark/">Dancing in the Dark</a>,” released earlier this year.</p>

<p>Oh, and that’s Zak Moran from The Druids (another great Irish band) on lead vocals above–and if he nailed his guest appearance, that might be because he’s had some previous practice with Bruce’s greatest hit–he’s been covering it since at least 2016.</p>
