<p><strong>1974: </strong>Bruce and his (still unnamed) band open a three-night stand headlining at Joe’s Place in Cambridge, Massachusetts. It’s neither the first nor the last time Bruce’s name is misspelled in print.</p>
<p><strong>1983: </strong>During his L.A. garage recording sessions, Bruce records an early and alternate arrangement of “Don’t Back Down on Our Love.”</p>

<p>If you’re interested in free ebook versions, allow me to introduce Brian, a Springsteen community developer who is hard at work on a solution. As you’ll see from his credentials, when he sets his mind to something great things tend to result. I’d highly recommend bookmarking his <a href="https://lilbud.github.io/">site</a> and following his progress.</p>
<p>And now a word from Brian:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px"><em>Hello to the readers of E Street Shuffle,</em></p>
<p><em>My name is Brian, a long time reader of E Street Shuffle, and something of an amateur archivist, with Bruce being a primary focus.</em></p>
<p><em>To introduce myself briefly, I am in my mid-20s and have been a fan of Bruce for at least 15 of those years (dating back to middle school). I’ve even been fortunate enough to see him 3 times, including the longest U.S. show to date (September 7, 2016 in Philadelphia.)</em></p>
<p><em>As for the “amateur archivist” part, well that is because I’ve contributed to/started a number of projects in the past few years to archive/preserve/catalog aspects of Bruce’s work. I am the developer behind <a href="https://www.databruce.com/">Databruce</a> (a Springsteen concert database site) and the curator of the <a href="https://archive.org/details/radionowhere">Radio Nowhere Archive</a> (a collection of Bruce bootlegs on Archive.org, available for streaming and downloading). Additionally, last April I worked with members of the StonePonyLondon forum to coordinate scanning the entire run of Backstreets Magazine, which is available for free <a href="https://lilbud.github.io/2025/04/06/backstreets-mag-archive/">here</a>.</em></p>
<p><em>To get to the point, I am using this opportunity to “formally” announce my plans for an offline archive/backup of E Street Shuffle. This archive will be available in a few formats, but likely the most interesting to the readers is <strong>a series of eBooks compiling the site’s content</strong>. I think the site is a great resource, and it would be a real shame for it to disappear.</em></p>
<p><em>I have written at length about my efforts so far, which you can see over on my blog <a href="https://lilbud.github.io/2026/01/03/shuffle-ebook/">here</a>. I discuss my work on the archive thus far, as well as my plans for the eBooks and even a bit about the process of archiving the site. This effort is expected to be ongoing, and I will post updates as it develops.</em></p>
<p><em>I want to thank Ken for allowing me the opportunity to contribute to the final E Street Shuffle post, and don’t forget to check out my site if you’re interested.</em></p>
<p>Thanks, Brian! And thank <em>you, </em>dear reader<em>, </em>for reading, subscribing, sharing, contributing, and encouraging the publication of this blog for the past eight years.</p>
