**New for 2026:** *New entry for 1983*

**1973:** Bruce and his unnamed band kick off a four-night/eight-show stand at The Main Point in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, where “[Santa Ana](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/03/06/roll-of-the-dice-santa-ana/)” receives its debut performance.

**1974:** Bruce and his (still unnamed) band open a three-night stand headlining at Joe’s Place in Cambridge, Massachusetts. It’s neither the first nor the last time Bruce’s name is misspelled in print.

**1983:** During his L.A. garage recording sessions, Bruce records an early and alternate arrangement of “Don’t Back Down on Our Love.”

**1994:** Bruce and Patti make an appearance at the Hollywood premiere of *Philadelphia.* Bruce wrote “[Streets of Philadelphia](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/06/30/roll-of-the-dice-streets-of-philadelphia/)” for the movie, for which he will go on to earn an Oscar. Check out the news coverage from the event.

….and that’s a wrap, folks!

To order printed volumes of this blog’s content, check out the Bookshelf Collection page [here](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/the-bookshelf-collection/). (Volume 2 orders close on January 7th.)

If you’re interested in free ebook versions, allow me to introduce Brian, a Springsteen community developer who is hard at work on a solution. As you’ll see from his credentials, when he sets his mind to something great things tend to result. I’d highly recommend bookmarking his [site](https://lilbud.github.io/) and following his progress.

And now a word from Brian:

*Hello to the readers of E Street Shuffle,*

*My name is Brian, a long time reader of E Street Shuffle, and something of an amateur archivist, with Bruce being a primary focus.*

*To introduce myself briefly, I am in my mid-20s and have been a fan of Bruce for at least 15 of those years (dating back to middle school). I’ve even been fortunate enough to see him 3 times, including the longest U.S. show to date (September 7, 2016 in Philadelphia.)*

*As for the “amateur archivist” part, well that is because I’ve contributed to/started a number of projects in the past few years to archive/preserve/catalog aspects of Bruce’s work. I am the developer behind [Databruce](https://www.databruce.com/) (a Springsteen concert database site) and the curator of the [Radio Nowhere Archive](https://archive.org/details/radionowhere) (a collection of Bruce bootlegs on Archive.org, available for streaming and downloading). Additionally, last April I worked with members of the StonePonyLondon forum to coordinate scanning the entire run of Backstreets Magazine, which is available for free [here](https://lilbud.github.io/2025/04/06/backstreets-mag-archive/).*

*To get to the point, I am using this opportunity to “formally” announce my plans for an offline archive/backup of E Street Shuffle. This archive will be available in a few formats, but likely the most interesting to the readers is **a series of eBooks compiling the site’s content**. I think the site is a great resource, and it would be a real shame for it to disappear.*

*I have written at length about my efforts so far, which you can see over on my blog [here](https://lilbud.github.io/2026/01/03/shuffle-ebook/). I discuss my work on the archive thus far, as well as my plans for the eBooks and even a bit about the process of archiving the site. This effort is expected to be ongoing, and I will post updates as it develops.*

*I want to thank Ken for allowing me the opportunity to contribute to the final E Street Shuffle post, and don’t forget to check out my site if you’re interested.*

Thanks, Brian! And thank *you,* dear reader*,* for reading, subscribing, sharing, contributing, and encouraging the publication of this blog for the past eight years.
