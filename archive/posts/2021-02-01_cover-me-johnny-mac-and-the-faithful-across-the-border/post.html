<p>Their new cover of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/09/06/roll-of-the-dice-across-the-border/">Across the Border</a>” does more than justice to Bruce’s original. Lead singer John Mclaughlin’s vocals are gorgeous, and the group’s arrangement is hopeful and expansive. This is a splendid cover.</p>
<p>And not that this has anything to do with the song, but does Johnny Mac bear an uncanny resemblance to The Boss himself, or what?</p>
