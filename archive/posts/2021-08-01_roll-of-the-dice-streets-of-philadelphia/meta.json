His legendary empathy and finely-drawn character studies seemed to be a thing of the past, as his writing became more personal and intimate. Fans doubted they&#8217;d ever hear lyrics in the vein of &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/03/04/roll-of-the-dice-the-river/\">The River</a>&#8221; or &#8220;Highway Patrolman&#8221; ever again.</p>\n<p>Then Jonathan Demme came calling.</p>\n<p>Actually, he called Neil Young first. Demme had already finished shooting his upcoming film when he decided he needed a rousing rock anthem to ease his audiences into his movie&#8217;s sobering, sensitive subject. He asked Neil to write one for him, but Neil sent him back a moving piano ballad instead. (It plays over the film&#8217;s closing credits.)</p>\n<p>He called Bruce next. Surely the American rock icon would rise to the task, and Bruce reportedly did his best to oblige. But the subject matter of Demme&#8217;s film hit a little too close to home. Bruce had recently lost a close family friend to cancer, and while AIDS is a very different disease from sarcoma, they share a common cruelty: the long, slow, withering and wasting away of their victims, while their loved ones can only keep watch and company.</p>\n<p>Bruce latched on to Tom Hanks&#8217; character in the movie and crafted a deeply, heartbreakingly empathic self-elegy that proved that Bruce still had his craft, just waiting for his command.</p>\n<p>The beauty of Bruce&#8217;s lyrics lies in the way he simultaneously describes both the biological and emotional toll of the disease, and the separation it creates in this life before death makes it permanent.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I was bruised and battered, I couldn&#8217;t tell what I felt</em><br />\n<em>I was unrecognizable to myself</em><br />\n<em>Saw my reflection in a window and didn&#8217;t know my own face</em><br />\n<em>So brother are you gonna leave me wasting away</em><br />\n<em>On the streets of Philadelphia</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I walked the avenue &#8217;til my legs felt like stone</em><br />\n<em>I heard the voices of friends vanished and gone</em><br />\n<em>At night I could hear the blood in my veins</em><br />\n<em>Just as black and whispering as the rain</em><br />\n<em>On the streets of Philadelphia</em></p>\n<p>These verses are among Bruce&#8217;s finest. What must it feel like to not recognize your own reflection anymore? Bruce&#8217;s narrator feels a sense of detachment from himself but craves connection with his&#8230; brother? Lover? Friend? Bruce deliberately leaves the identity a mystery so that the song relates universally.</p>\n<p>But especially at the time the song was written, AIDS drove a wedge of fear that isolated its victims. Our narrator isn&#8217;t the first in his circle to be claimed by the disease&#8211;he&#8217;s already lost friends and loved ones. That loss weighs him down as much as the disease itself does, and at night he can hear the blood in his veins&#8211;that&#8217;s Bruce conveying not just how weak he&#8217;s become but how alone he is. There&#8217;s no sound but his own blood.</p>\n<p>The streets of Philadelphia represent the purgatory our narrator finds himself in&#8211;shunned by but not yet ready to leave this world. As the second verse transitions to the bridge, our narrator&#8217;s detachment gives way to anguish.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Ain&#8217;t no angel gonna greet me</em><br />\n<em>It&#8217;s just you and I my friend</em><br />\n<em>And my clothes don&#8217;t fit me no more</em><br />\n<em>I walked a thousand miles just to slip this skin</em></p>\n<p>Bruce conveys so much with these four lines, especially the first: he uses the angel to convey both societal ostracism and self-loathing with a single religious symbol. Our narrator is alone, unloved even by himself.</p>\n<p>And here we have what is perhaps the song&#8217;s greatest heartbreak: even the narrator&#8217;s lover has abandoned him, or at least distanced himself. In the song&#8217;s final verse, our narrator pleads with him for a simple kiss so that he knows he&#8217;s not alone, that he&#8217;s still here in this world.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>The night has fallen, I&#8217;m lying awake</em><br />\n<em>I can feel myself fading away</em><br />\n<em>So receive me brother with your faithless kiss</em><br />\n<em>Or will we leave each other alone like this</em><br />\n<em>On the streets of Philadelphia</em></p>\n<p>We never find out whether the narrator&#8217;s brother answers his plea, or even whether he hears it. The song leaves us in the narrator&#8217;s purgatory, where we serve as his only company.</p>\n<p>Much to Demme&#8217;s frustration, Bruce&#8217;s tragically poetic lyrics weren&#8217;t suited for a rock anthem no matter how hard the songwriter tried. Bruce ended up taking the backing track in a different direction&#8211;a <em>very\u00a0</em>different direction. He made a demo with a hip-hop beat and ethereal synths, and in an echo of <em>Nebraska</em>, he found it hard to improve upon the demo.</p>\n<p>The released versions (most of them, anyway) feature added backing vocals and bass from 1992-93 touring band member Tommy Sims, and the movie features glimpses of Little Jimmy Scott&#8217;s vocals. But other than those elements, it&#8217;s tough to tell the difference between various versions and mixes without a very deep listen.</p>\n<p>Demme was profoundly moved by the song Bruce sent him, but he threw up his hands in hopelessness over ever getting the rocker he&#8217;d hoped for. Fortunately, Demme&#8217;s wife convinced him to pay attention to what Neil and Bruce were saying with their songs&#8211;perhaps he didn&#8217;t really need an anthem to draw an audience after all.</p>\n<p>She was right. Upon release, &#8220;Streets of Philadelphia&#8221; became more than just a hit single&#8211;it became one of Bruce&#8217;s all-time greatest hits and his very last Top Ten radio single ever.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Streets of Philadelphia&#8221; peaked at #9 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the U.S., #4 in Australia, #2 in the U.K., and #1 in France, Germany, Canada, Italy and other countries.</p>\n<p>Combined with gushing critical acclaim, the song&#8217;s popularity powered &#8220;Streets of Philadelphia&#8217; through awards season, garnering Bruce his first Oscar&#8230;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Streets of Philadelphia  Oscars 1994 4K*\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/362SVFvDuYk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8230;a Golden Globe Award&#8230;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen Wins Best Original Song - Golden Globes 1994\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/En4D3L5EGZc?start=1&#038;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8230;four Grammy Awards&#8230;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen&#039;s &quot;Streets of Philadelphia&quot; opens the 37th Annual Grammy Awards\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2D1EdYtNqVc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8230;and an MTV Video Music Award.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"streets of philadelphia (live ) bruce springsteen\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hFqswzMmnI4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Well aware that his image as an All-American Male made him an especially powerful messenger for the theme of the song and movie, Bruce used his podium moments to express his compassion and encourage acceptance.</p>\n<p>Bruce wasn&#8217;t finished exploring this theme. Well after he released &#8220;Streets of Philadelphia,&#8221; he recorded a song with the E Street Band called &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/06/28/roll-of-the-dice-waiting-on-the-end-of-the-world/\">Waiting on the End of the World</a>,&#8221; which contains lyrics so similar to &#8220;Streets of Philadelphia&#8221; that it may actually be a derivative of an early version of it.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Waiting On The End Of The World\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9VdUYYw6wtA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>A quarter-century on, &#8220;Streets of Philadelphia&#8221; is not only regarded as one of the greatest songs ever to grace a motion picture, it&#8217;s also enshrined in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#8217;s 500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll. And while it may have marked the end of Bruce&#8217;s commercial popularity, it kick-started the next phase of his career and cemented his enduring critical popularity.</p>\n<p>With that kind of pedigree, one would think Bruce would perform it more frequently. Yet, &#8220;Streets of Philadelphia&#8221; remains a relative rarity outside of his acoustic tours.\u00a0Why doesn&#8217;t Bruce play it more often? Perhaps because &#8220;Streets of Philadelphia&#8221; is too intimate and frail a song to translate well to a muscular band arrangement. I&#8217;d certainly argue in favor of his acoustic performances when selecting his best versions.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen \u261c\u2764\ufe0f\u261e Streets of Philadelphia {Solo \ud83c\udfb8}  Audio\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/B4QOJN5Ezoc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Streets of Philadelphia - Live Piano\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5xHfdR5n99w?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Still, &#8220;Streets of Philadelphia&#8221; is a pretty sure bet when Bruce brings the band to Philly, as it remains a reliable way to please people who like to cheer for their town&#8217;s name.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Streets of Philadelphia - Springsteen - Philadelphia Sept 9, 2016\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qmqYhkmaCIE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>So if &#8220;Streets of Philadelphia&#8221; is on your chase list, you&#8217;ve still got a pretty good chance of catching it live&#8230; as long as you make the trip to the City of Brotherly Love.</p>\n<p><strong>Streets of Philadelphia<br />\nRecorded:</strong> August 1993<br />\n<strong>Released:\u00a0</strong><em>Philadelphia\u00a0</em>(1994),\u00a0<em>Greatest Hits\u00a0</em>(1995),\u00a0<em>The Essential Bruce Springsteen</em> (2003)<br />\n<strong>First performed:</strong> January 27, 1994 (Los Angeles, CA)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> September 9, 2016 (Philadelphia, PA)</p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
