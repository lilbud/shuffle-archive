At The Back Door in Richmond, VA, 46 years ago today, Bruce played this one-time-only cover of “I’m Into Something Good,” written by Gerry Goffin and Carole King but made famous by Herman’s Hermits.

“I’m Into Something Good’ was originally recorded by Earl-Jean and released as a single in 1964–but it never charted on the Hot 100.

Shortly after, Herman’s Hermits released their version as their first single, and it went right to the top of the U.K. Singles Chart.
