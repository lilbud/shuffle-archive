<p>Jordan Foley and Tyler Hood’s new cover of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/12/25/roll-of-the-dice-dancing-in-the-dark/">Dancing in the Dark</a>” rockets immediately to the top tier of my favorite versions of this very, very, <em>very </em>oft-covered song.</p>
<p>Foley is a folk-Americana singer-songwriter based in Orlando, and we can clearly hear those influences in his impressive interpretation.</p>

<p>“Dancing in the Dark” is a dark song at heart, with a theme of restless alienation that connects it to Bruce’s <em>Nebraska</em> period that immediately preceded it. Foley and Hood dial right into the spirit of Bruce’s song and bring the narrator to life through Foley’s deeply empathic vocals.</p>
<p>If you’re in the Orlando area, Jordan and Tyler are <a href="https://www.jordanfoleymusic.com/tour">on tour now</a> (yes, now), so if you’re vaccinated and missing live music, there’s a chance you might even be able to see them perform this terrific cover live.</p>
