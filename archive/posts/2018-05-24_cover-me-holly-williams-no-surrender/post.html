Unlike the original’s defiant anthem arrangement, Holly’s version is wistful and nostalgic–an ode to old friendship that captures the same spirit as the slow arrangement that Bruce performed occasionally on the Born in the U.S.A. Tour. (I actually think it captures it better.)</p>
<p>This one sticks with you long after you hear it.</p>
