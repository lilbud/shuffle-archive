Unwilling to cancel the performance, Bono called in a few favors, and U2 took the stage as scheduled, but with temporary frontmen: Bruce and Chris Martin each took a turn at the microphone, and one of Bruce&#8217;s numbers was&#8230; well, by now you know.</p>\n<div id=\"v-aSL5ziVQ-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='426' src='https://videopress.com/embed/aSL5ziVQ?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>The love-fest continued most recently in 2015, when Bruce made a surprise appearance at U2&#8217;s Madison Square Garden gig.
