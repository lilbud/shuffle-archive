<p>Here’s a lovely cover of one of my favorite songs from <em>Tracks:</em></p>
<p>“<a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/04/06/roll-of-the-dice-janey-dont-you-lose-heart/">Janey, Don’t You Lose Heart</a>” performed by Jesse Malin and some very talented backing musicians (that’s clearly Joe Grushecky on guitar, and I’m pretty sure that’s Willie Nile lurking at the edge of the frame on tambourine) at McLoone’s in Asbury Park during Light of Day 2017.</p>
<p>Nothing particularly remarkable or unusual about this one, just a sweet performance by some great musicians. Here’s hoping for a reprise next month!</p>
