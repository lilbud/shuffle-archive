<p>The last time Bruce had a milestone birthday, Philadelphia’s WXPN-FM (shout-out to my all-time favorite radio station) organized an on-air 60th Birthday Bash tribute.</p>
<p>The event featured an array of wonderful artists, but their song choices largely hewed to the usual candidates. There were several “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/06/30/roll-of-the-dice-streets-of-philadelphia/">Streets of Philadelphia</a>” covers, a couple versions of “Born to Run,” and of course a few “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/09/11/roll-of-the-dice-im-on-fire/">I’m on Fire</a>” renditions.</p>
<p>But singer/songwriter Lizanne Knott went deep that night, turning in a lovely cover of “Stolen Car.”</p>

<p>More wistful than haunted, Lizanne’s arrangement makes for a very different song than Bruce’s original. But isn’t that what a cover should be?</p>
<p>Lizanne finally released her cover of “Stolen Car” years later on her 2016 album, <em>Excellent Day</em>.</p>
