Despite my best efforts, this book is going to be confusing at times, and that confusion starts here.

Many of the eighteen tracks on *L.A. Garage Sessions '83* share DNA with each other, some lyrically, some musically, some thematically, and some just in their titles.

"Don't Back Down on Our Love" checks all four of those boxes.

The distant cousin is "Don't Back Down," which we'll discuss later in this book. Two songs share a title and one-line chorus, but beyond that they are completely different songs.

The kissing cousin is "Black Mountain Ballad," which is so close lyrically to "Don't Back Down on Our Love" that we might consider the two songs to merely be alternate arrangements of each other.

Springsteen worked on "Don't Back Down on Our Love" quite a bit in the early months of 1983, and surprisingly almost a dozen preliminary takes have circulated among collectors for many years. All of the takes feature the same finished lyrics and rockabilly music, and the differences between each version are trivial if not undetectable.

One early take is a stark outlier, however. It seems that for a brief moment in time, Bruce was flirting with an alternate arrangement for the song.

Let's check box #3: this is the same arrangement we'll hear when we reach "The Klansman" later in these pages!

As for Box Four, let's examine the song's verses and bridge.

*When the night winds rustle the far away leaves*
*Rolling down the Kayona Valley through the cottonwood trees*
*And the wild river rises with the last season's rains*
*I awake in the darkness and I call your name*

*I awake and I know that sleep won't come soon*
*So I watch the headlights crawl up and down the wall of the lonesome room*
*Think of that club by the river where we danced on and on*
*Swore our love would last forever and you laughed on and on*

*Yeah I wanna weep but I'm broke inside and my tears won't run*
*I wanna sleep but there ain't no dream and the sleep won't come*

*Last night I stood on Black Mountain and looked out to the sea*
*Where the waters of Mystery River go rushing endlessly*
*And the love we swore would last as long as those waters roared on*
*I awoke in the darkness, it was gone, gone, gone*

Content-wise, "Don't Back Down on Our Love" is an early example (even if only recently released) of thematic ground Bruce would travel over often in the years to come.

As the song begins, our narrator wakes in darkness and calls for his lost love, recalling happier days in romanticized places, a lyrical conceit he'd use as soon as "Downbound Train" and as recently as "Reno."

He lies awake, sleepless and haunted by memory and loss. Later in this book, we'll explore "Fugitive's Dream" (both versions) and "Unsatisfied Heart," both of which feature haunted protagonists roaming the night. (Box Four)

It's difficult to treat "Don't Back Down on Our Love" as anything other than an experiment or work in progress, so primitive it is when compared to later masterpieces like "Downbound Train."

Black Mountain? Mystery River? Bruce is obviously writing in dream metaphor (the narrator awakes in the final line), but even so these lyrics are uncharacteristically on-the-nose.

Every close and distant relative to "Don't Back Down on Our Love" improves on the DNA it inherited, so we can consider this early track a gift to those of us fascinated by Bruce's artistic process.
