is an intensely bitter post-breakup song with a central storm metaphor that didn&#8217;t really require a lot of imagination to craft a song around. (Lifting the song title from Shakespeare, however, required a little bit of chutzpah.)</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>The wind and rain slashing at my window pane</em><br />\n<em>Lightning&#8217;s flashing, looks like the sky&#8217;s gone insane</em><br />\n<em>And it seems like you have lied again</em><br />\n<em>And now I&#8217;m left with the wind and rain</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Oh shattered truth, jagged memories of you</em><br />\n<em>You know it&#8217;s hard, them dreams that just can&#8217;t come true</em><br />\n<em>How long has it been since I&#8217;ve known you</em><br />\n<em>Now the wind and the rain is my only truth</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Summertime, summertime, that was when you were mine</em><br />\n<em>And now that&#8217;s left so far behind</em><br />\n<em>Can&#8217;t you see what you&#8217;ve done to my mind</em><br />\n<em>Now the wind and the rain&#8217;s forever mine</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Then time shorn it up</em><br />\n<em>The years have made me far too tough</em><br />\n<em>You know where I start and I go, I got drowned</em><br />\n<em>Now the wind and the rain is my only love</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Wintertime</em><br />\n<em>Memories of when you were mine</em><br />\n<em>Let &#8217;em shine</em><br />\n<em>Golden moments lost in time</em><br />\n<em>Now I hear the grandfather chime</em><br />\n<em>Wind and rain&#8217;s forever mine</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Now the wind and the rain slashing at my window pane</em><br />\n<em>Seems like you have lied again</em><br />\n<em>By now I guess that it&#8217;s just the same</em><br />\n<em>And I am left with the wind and the rain</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Hasn&#8217;t time shown you enough</em><br />\n<em>The years have made me far too tough</em><br />\n<em>But you know where I stood when the going got rough</em><br />\n<em>The wind and rain is my only love</em></p>\n<p>As is often the case with Bruce&#8217;s Steel Mill material, the lyrics are just a coatrack on which to hang an epic instrumental jam or three. And my oh my, these are epic jams.</p>\n<p>From the four-minute intro to the nine-minute(!) mid-song break to the two minute finale (only about four minutes out of the twenty feature actual singing), Bruce is jaw-droppingly impressive on lead guitar. This twenty-year-old kid shreds with an intensity we&#8217;ve rarely seen from him since, and certainly at greater length than we&#8217;ve ever heard him commit to at one go.</p>\n<p>And what&#8217;s most thrilling is that we can tell just by listening that Bruce knows exactly how good he is. Throughout his E Street career, even during his most impressive solos Bruce rarely shows off. In 1970, though, he was cocky as all hell, and that confidence electrifies his performance.</p>\n<p>Bruce was a triple threat at the time, flooring ever-growing audiences with his frontman presence, guitar shredding, and rapidly maturing songwriting. Before long, Bruce would decide to focus on only two of those three.</p>\n<p>But what if he&#8217;d chosen differently? Four months after that Monmouth performance, Bruce invited Robbin Thompson to join Steel Mill as the band&#8217;s new co-lead vocalist, for a brief time it seemed like Bruce might be content to earn his place in history with his instrument rather than his stage presence.</p>\n<p>Imagine if Bruce had dedicated himself to the guitar with the same single-minded ferocity that would come to characterize his vocal performances. He was probably always deservedly destined for fame, but in some alternate universe, there&#8217;s probably a Bruce Springsteen who is rightfully considered one of the greatest guitar players of all time.</p>\n<p><strong>The Wind and The Rain<br />\nNever recorded</strong><br />\n<strong>Never released</strong><br />\n<strong>First performed:</strong> April 24, 1970 (West Long Branch, NJ)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> August 14, 1970 (Richmond, VA)</p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
