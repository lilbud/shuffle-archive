<p>Bruce Springsteen: Guitar Hero.</p>
<p>If anybody ever laughs when you say those words, make them listen to “The Wind and The Rain” and collect your apology.</p>

<p>As you can tell from the recording, “The Wind and The Rain” dates back a ways–more than a half-century. That performance was from Steel Mill’s Monmouth College gig on April 24, 1970, and the lyrics date back farther still.</p>
<p>Remember that <a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/?s=1968+notebook">1968 Notebook</a> we’ve taken several dips into over the past four years? Well, tucked into the final pages of it were these early lyrics.</p>

<p>There’s another set of early lyrics in existence for “The Wind and The Rain,” too:</p>

<p>A careful read of either version will reveal lyrics that never made it to the stage:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Clouded sky it’s been that way since you’ve been gone</em><br/>
<em>I’ve served my punishment for doing you wrong</em><br/>
<em>So why does the feeling keep hanging on</em><br/>
<em>The wind + rain is my only song</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Countless days now my skin has wrinkled up</em><br/>
<em>Yet I haven’t had enough</em><br/>
<em>The years have made me far too tough</em><br/>
<em>For the wind + rain is all I love</em></p>
<p>But honestly, for all that workshopping, the final verses aren’t much to write home about either. “The Wind and The Rain” is an intensely bitter post-breakup song with a central storm metaphor that didn’t really require a lot of imagination to craft a song around. (Lifting the song title from Shakespeare, however, required a little bit of chutzpah.)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>The wind and rain slashing at my window pane</em><br/>
<em>Lightning’s flashing, looks like the sky’s gone insane</em><br/>
<em>And it seems like you have lied again</em><br/>
<em>And now I’m left with the wind and rain</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Oh shattered truth, jagged memories of you</em><br/>
<em>You know it’s hard, them dreams that just can’t come true</em><br/>
<em>How long has it been since I’ve known you</em><br/>
<em>Now the wind and the rain is my only truth</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Summertime, summertime, that was when you were mine</em><br/>
<em>And now that’s left so far behind</em><br/>
<em>Can’t you see what you’ve done to my mind</em><br/>
<em>Now the wind and the rain’s forever mine</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Then time shorn it up</em><br/>
<em>The years have made me far too tough</em><br/>
<em>You know where I start and I go, I got drowned</em><br/>
<em>Now the wind and the rain is my only love</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Wintertime</em><br/>
<em>Memories of when you were mine</em><br/>
<em>Let ’em shine</em><br/>
<em>Golden moments lost in time</em><br/>
<em>Now I hear the grandfather chime</em><br/>
<em>Wind and rain’s forever mine</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Now the wind and the rain slashing at my window pane</em><br/>
<em>Seems like you have lied again</em><br/>
<em>By now I guess that it’s just the same</em><br/>
<em>And I am left with the wind and the rain</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Hasn’t time shown you enough</em><br/>
<em>The years have made me far too tough</em><br/>
<em>But you know where I stood when the going got rough</em><br/>
<em>The wind and rain is my only love</em></p>
<p>As is often the case with Bruce’s Steel Mill material, the lyrics are just a coatrack on which to hang an epic instrumental jam or three. And my oh my, these are epic jams.</p>
<p>From the four-minute intro to the nine-minute(!) mid-song break to the two minute finale (only about four minutes out of the twenty feature actual singing), Bruce is jaw-droppingly impressive on lead guitar. This twenty-year-old kid shreds with an intensity we’ve rarely seen from him since, and certainly at greater length than we’ve ever heard him commit to at one go.</p>
<p>And what’s most thrilling is that we can tell just by listening that Bruce knows exactly how good he is. Throughout his E Street career, even during his most impressive solos Bruce rarely shows off. In 1970, though, he was cocky as all hell, and that confidence electrifies his performance.</p>
<p>Bruce was a triple threat at the time, flooring ever-growing audiences with his frontman presence, guitar shredding, and rapidly maturing songwriting. Before long, Bruce would decide to focus on only two of those three.</p>
<p>But what if he’d chosen differently? Four months after that Monmouth performance, Bruce invited Robbin Thompson to join Steel Mill as the band’s new co-lead vocalist, for a brief time it seemed like Bruce might be content to earn his place in history with his instrument rather than his stage presence.</p>
<p>Imagine if Bruce had dedicated himself to the guitar with the same single-minded ferocity that would come to characterize his vocal performances. He was probably always deservedly destined for fame, but in some alternate universe, there’s probably a Bruce Springsteen who is rightfully considered one of the greatest guitar players of all time.</p>
