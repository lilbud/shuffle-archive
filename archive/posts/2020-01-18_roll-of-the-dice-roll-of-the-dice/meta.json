Roy demoed his new state-of-the-art synthesizer setup for Bruce and showed him how his rig could capture the classic E Street Band sound all on its own via an instrumental track he&#8217;d whipped up. Bruce was astounded at both the versatility of Roy&#8217;s setup and the track itself, and he insisted that Roy make him a tape of the track to take home with him.</p>\n<p>Bruce remembers it a bit differently:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&#8220;Roy had some tracks that he&#8217;d play to me on occasion. So I called him and said, &#8216;Come on over, maybe I&#8217;ll try to write to some of your tracks.&#8217; So he had the music to &#8216;Roll of the Dice,&#8217; and I came up with the idea for that.&#8221;\u00a0</em>(Rolling Stone, August 6 1992)</p>\n<p>Regardless, Roy&#8217;s riffing proved to be the key that unlocked the writer&#8217;s block that Bruce had been suffering from, and literally overnight, &#8220;Roll of the Dice&#8221; became the first song created for Bruce&#8217;s\u00a0<em>Human Touch</em> album, and a few days later it became the first one recorded.</p>\n<p>This was December 1989, though, and it be more than another two years before the song would see the light of day.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Roll of the Dice (Audio)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8vL_3e4w-Ew?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">&#8220;At first, I had nothing to say. Throughout &#8217;88 and &#8217;89, every time I sat down to write, I was just sort of rehashing\u00a0<em>Tunnel of Love</em>, except not as good. And it was all just down and nihilistic. It&#8217;s funny, because I think people probably associate my music with a lot of positives. But it&#8217;s like I really drift into that other thing&#8211;I think there&#8217;s been a lot of desperate fun in my songs.&#8221;\u00a0</span></p></blockquote>\n<p>&#8220;Desperate fun&#8221; is as good a descriptor as any for &#8220;Roll of the Dice.&#8221;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well I&#8217;ve been a losing gambler, yeah just throwing snake eyes</em><br />\n<em>Oh love ain&#8217;t got me downhearted, I know up around the corner lies</em><br />\n<em>My fool&#8217;s paradise in just another roll of the dice (oh yeah)</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>All my elevens and sevens been coming up sixes and nines (hmm yeah)</em><br />\n<em>Since I fell for you baby I&#8217;m coming on changing times (oh yeah)</em><br />\n<em>They&#8217;re waiting over the rise in just another roll of the dice</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I&#8217;ve stumbled and I know I made my mistakes</em><br />\n<em>Oh but tonight I&#8217;m gonna be playing for all of the stakes</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well it&#8217;s never too late so come on girl, the tables are waiting (oh yeah)</em><br />\n<em>Oh you and me and Lady Luck well tonight we&#8217;ll be celebrating</em><br />\n<em>Drinking champagne on ice in just another roll of the dice (ooh hoo hoo)</em><br />\n<em>Whoa whoa whoa yeah</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>High-rollers, lay down your bets and I&#8217;ll raise &#8217;em</em><br />\n<em>Well I know the odds ain&#8217;t in my favor (oh no)</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Maybe I&#8217;m just a clown throwing down looking to come up busted (oh no)</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;m a thief in the house of love and I can&#8217;t be trusted</em><br />\n<em>Well I&#8217;ll be making my heist in just another roll of the dice</em><br />\n<em>Just another roll of the dice</em></p>\n<p>Truth be told, this isn&#8217;t Bruce at his lyrical best: Although there some genuinely clever turns of phrase (&#8220;my elevens and sevens been coming up sixes and nines&#8221; and &#8220;I&#8217;m a thief in the house of love and I can&#8217;t be trusted&#8221; are as good as any lines he&#8217;s ever written), he strains the gambling metaphor to its breaking point, there&#8217;s some awkward phrasing (&#8220;all of the stakes&#8221;) and a lazy rhyme in the bridge (&#8220;raise &#8217;em&#8221; and &#8220;favor&#8221;).</p>\n<p>But all that is more than made up for by the sheer joy and exuberance of Bruce&#8217;s vocal performance. The lyrics are secondary to the vocals, as odd as that reads. Listen to the track and you&#8217;ll hear what I mean: Bobby King&#8217;s call-and-response backing vocals\u00a0 more than match Bruce&#8217;s gusto, building to a coda that&#8217;s 40% of the entire song.&#8221;Roll of the Dice&#8221; is far, far from Bruce&#8217;s best song, but the last minute and 45 seconds of the song may rank among his best studio performances.</p>\n<p>But while Bruce&#8217;s performance emphasizes the fun, if we pay attention to the lyrics we hear the desperation as well: our narrator is a serial Romeo who sees every relationship as a gamble. His track record ain&#8217;t great, and while it&#8217;s admirable that he never loses faith in himself, he kind of gives away the game in the first verse: he&#8217;s fallen for a girl who he knows will lead him to a &#8220;fool&#8217;s paradise&#8221; &#8212; or maybe it&#8217;s the other way around: he can&#8217;t be trusted in the house of love, after all.</p>\n<p>In any case, he&#8217;s in a state of denial of the trouble that he actually confesses he&#8217;s aware lies ahead. He&#8217;s rolling the dice again, and he knows he&#8217;s going to lose&#8211;but that&#8217;s okay, because between here and there lies a lot of fun.</p>\n<p>When Bruce performs &#8220;Roll of the Dice&#8221; in concert, that desperate fun translates well to the stage. Almost immediately, it became a centerpiece of his 1992-93 world tour, and if you listened carefully during the seven-minute(!) coda, you&#8217;d hear what in retrospect we can recognize as a startlingly honest admission, and the song changes meaning as a result. In the clip below (from the home video release of <em>In Concert/MTV Plugged</em>), Bruce almost seems to drop character along with the melody.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Roll of the Dice (from In Concert/MTV Plugged)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eFIh-5SYwK0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&#8220;Have you ever felt so empty inside, empty like you had nothing left&#8230; you&#8217;re unsure of yourself, like you weren&#8217;t sure who you were anymore&#8230; have you ever been so alone that all you wanted to do was hide, and when you reach down inside you can find nothing left inside. You&#8217;re unsure of all the things that\u00a0 you love.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>In 1992, after being out of the public eye for almost four years, a bout of writer&#8217;s block, the dissolution of his band, the search for a new voice, and the beginning of a family, that sounded more like a confession than shtick.</p>\n<p>But it was also a way of recasting the gamble at the heart of the song as bravery rather than foolhardiness&#8211;that expending the effort required to forge a strong relationship can help save you from the most destructive parts of yourself. Or as he quoted in a 1993 television performance that never was (a story for another day), &#8220;everybody needs somebody.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Roll Of The Dice - Bruce Springsteen and The Other Band\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NdXifgoJhuA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>When Bruce wrote the lyrics for &#8220;Roll of the Dice&#8221; in December 1989, Patti was newly pregnant with their first child. When Bruce first performed it more than two years later, he was a married man with two children. That changed him, and it changed the song.</p>\n<p>By the time Bruce reclaimed &#8220;Roll of the Dice&#8221; for the E Street Band late in the Reunion Tour, he had taken the song pretty far from its origins. Fun had taken the driver&#8217;s seat, and desperation got shoved to the back.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Roll of the Dice (Live 2000-06-12)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wvPNteUx6XY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>In recent years (and in keeping with the song), your best bet for hearing Bruce play &#8220;Roll of the Dice&#8221; live is to catch him in casino town&#8211;the song has made appearances in Las Vegas, Atlantic City, and the Mohegan Sun casino.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen | Roll Of The Dice - Uncasville - 18/05/2014 (Multicam/Dubbed)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/StM9ZjHaFOc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>But among the 120 performances of &#8220;Roll of the Dice&#8221; Bruce has given us over the years (90% of which were on the 1992-93 tour), two stand out as unique.
