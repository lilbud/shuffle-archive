Passenger broke through in 2012 with his global hit, “Let Her Go.” About two years later, he covered Bruce’s “[The River](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/03/04/roll-of-the-dice-the-river/)” during a promotional appearance at SiriusXM.

Passenger’s gentle singer-songwriter vibe is well-suited for the quieter side of Bruce’s catalog, and his stripped-down, acoustic approach to “The River” captures its melancholia in sharp black and white.

(Gotta admit, though, I’m a bit distracted by the checkered-shirt dude in the background. About halfway through, he seems to get lost in the song.)
