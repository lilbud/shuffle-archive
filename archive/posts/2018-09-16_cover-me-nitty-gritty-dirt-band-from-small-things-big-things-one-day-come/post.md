The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band has a knack for spotting Springsteen songs that are ripe for a rockabilly cover treatment.

They scored with [their 1984 cover of “Cadillac Ranch,”](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/02/26/cover-me-nitty-gritty-dirt-band-cadillac-ranch/) and six years later they rescued “From Small Things” from obscurity and landed it on the Billboard Country Top 100 chart, where it peaked at #65.

Their version breathes a bit more than Bruce’s original but retains its rebellious outlaw spirit. Here’s the studio recording and a live TV performance.
