**2002:** Bruce tour debuts “[Darlington County](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/09/10/roll-of-the-dice-darlington-county/),” and Emmylou Harris makes a guest appearance on “[My Hometown](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/04/09/roll-of-the-dice-my-hometown/)” when Bruce and the E Street Band bring the Rising Tour to Birmingham, Alabama.

**2005:** Bruce plays an *almost* solo acoustic show at Hard Rock Live in Hollywood, Florida… almost solo, because he’s joined by two notable guests: Steve Van Zandt and Clarence Clemons. The mini-reunion only lasts for three songs, but it’s delightful–particularly a magical “[Drive All Night](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/02/27/roll-of-the-dice-drive-all-night/).” Oh, and not for nothing: “[Roll of the Dice](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/01/18/roll-of-the-dice-roll-of-the-dice/)” makes its tour debut as well.

**2007:** The first leg of the Magic Tour ends in Boston, and with it, a chapter of the E Street Band’s history. Although no one knows it yet, this will be the last full show to feature founding member Danny Federici, whose illness will be announced shortly after. The band knows it though, and it’s an emotional night. Bruce designs the setlist to spotlight Danny, peppering the show with organ- and accordion-centric songs like “[4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/04/26/roll-of-the-dice-4th-of-july-asbury-park-sandy/)” and “[Kitty’s Back.](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/01/22/roll-of-the-dice-kittys-back/)” Bruce also tour premieres “This Hard Land” and “[Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/11/19/roll-of-the-dice-tenth-avenue-freeze-out/)” (the latter with guest-star Peter Wolf) in this memorable night. This show is available as part of Bruce’s official archive series–get it [here](https://live.brucespringsteen.net/live-music/0,19238/Bruce-Springsteen---The-E-Street-Band-mp3-flac-download-11-19-2007-TD-Banknorth-Garden-Boston-MA.html).

**2012:** From Kansas City to Denver, Bruce plays another city-themed opening number, starting his Wrecking Ball show at the Pepsi Center with “[Get Out of Denver](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/07/11/cover-me-get-out-of-denver/),” a tour premiere. Also played for the first time this tour: “[Across the Borderline](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/03/26/matr-bruce-springsteen-bonnie-raitt-and-jackson-browne-across-the-borderline/),” with one verse in Spanish. And while it isn’t a premiere, any outing for “[Bishop Danced](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/05/18/roll-of-the-dice-bishop-danced/)” is notable.
