It dates back to 1930, when it was first recorded by The Mississippi Sheiks, and its evergreen popularity is no doubt due in large part to its ironic lyrics: in any incarnation, the singer recounts his woes but still insists with each verse that he&#8217;s &#8220;sitting on top of the world&#8221; &#8212; determined to remain optimistic even though nothing about his circumstances may warrant it.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Roots of Blues -- The Mississippi Sheiks \u201eSitting On Top Of T\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RqeW7-tmVU4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>By the time Earth first performed the song in 1968, &#8220;Sitting on Top of the World&#8221; had been covered and adapted many times over, most recently by Cream.
