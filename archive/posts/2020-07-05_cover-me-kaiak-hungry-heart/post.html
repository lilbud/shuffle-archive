<p>Emil and Marcos draw the inspiration for their music from nature, friends, and “really good coffee.”</p>
<p>That description lends itself well to their covers, too, because I can totally dig listening to their version of Bruce’s “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/12/21/roll-of-the-dice-hungry-heart/">Hungry Heart</a>” while taking my morning coffee outside on a lazy weekend morning.</p>

<p>That cover track has been around for a few years, but recently the guys teased us with a thirty-second video to go with it.</p>

<p>There’s no indication whether a full-length version is coming, but we can hope. In the meantime, check out more of Kaiak’s music <a href="https://www.kaiakmusic.se/">here</a>.</p>
