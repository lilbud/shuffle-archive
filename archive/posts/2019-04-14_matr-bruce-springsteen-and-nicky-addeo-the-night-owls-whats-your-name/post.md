On April 2, 2011, Nicky Addeo and the Night Owls played the Wonder Bar in Asbury Park.

Nicky Addeo isn’t a household name, but in 1963 he released a song called “Gloria” with The Darchaes, and Bruce was a big fan of it.

“When you wanted to make your move, you waited for Nicky Addeo to sing ,” Bruce explained that evening in Asbury Park. Bruce got a chance to play the song with Nicky that night, and he stayed on stage for several songs, including “What’s Your Name?”

“What’s Your Name” was released in 1962 by Don and Juan. It was their only hit, reaching #7 on the Billboard pop chart. The boys’ cover is pretty true to the original.
