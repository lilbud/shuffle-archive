<p>This one’s for the completists (like me).</p>
<p>“School Is Out” was Gary U.S. Bonds follow-up to his smash hit (and frequent Springsteen encore) “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/08/21/cover-me-quarter-to-three/">Quarter to Three</a>.”</p>
<p>Released in 1961, “School Is Out” is certainly cut from the same cloth as its predecessor, opening with the same count-in, the same hand-clap syncopation, and the same use of background hoots and whistles.</p>

<p>It was perhaps too similar to match the chart performance of “Quarter to Three” but close enough to get some lift from it, peaking at #5 in the US.</p>
<p>Bruce has covered it once only–with Gary himself, on stage at the Old Waldorf in San Francisco, on a River Tour break back in June of 1981.</p>
<p>The sound quality is terrible, but it’s the only document we have of Bruce performing this early rock hit. Give it a listen below (for as long as you can).</p>
