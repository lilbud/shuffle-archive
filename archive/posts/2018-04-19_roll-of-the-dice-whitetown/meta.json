Listen to the 1979 demo below&#8211;not only will you hear essentially the same melody as &#8220;Mr. Outside,&#8221; (along with another never-released outtake, &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/02/23/roll-of-the-dice-you-gotta-be-kind/\">You Gotta Be Kind</a>&#8220;), you&#8217;ll also hear him namechecked.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN - down in whitetown #1\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HwmtT9WAyAM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Most of the released outtakes sounded like more polished versions of the demos (some more than others), but not &#8220;Whitetown.&#8221; I&#8217;m not sure what I was expecting, but definitely not this:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Whitetown (Studio Outtake - 1980)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hGYRFDYoNPI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>If I didn&#8217;t know better, I&#8217;d peg this version of &#8220;Whitetown&#8221; as an outtake from\u00a0<em>Working on a Dream</em> rather than\u00a0<em>The River</em>. It certainly has the lush sound and the growing-old theme of WOAD, and that&#8217;s has modern-day singing voice too&#8211;which makes me suspect that Bruce significantly rewrote and recorded this song sometime in the last decade. Check out these lyrics&#8211;some lines are retained from the old outtake (which was never very cohesive lyrically), but it&#8217;s now a very different song, almost a re-write of &#8220;Glory Days&#8221; (set in northeast Philly to boot&#8211;the Kensington and &#8220;el&#8221; (elevated train) references give that away).</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Mary Ann on the avenue</em><br />\n<em>Girl all dressed up in Kensington blue</em><br />\n<em>Down where the hammer falls</em><br />\n<em>She&#8217;s born and bred within Whitetown walls</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Each and every thing slowly passes away</em><br />\n<em>She moves alone along the narrow street</em><br />\n<em>From a passing car she hears the music play</em><br />\n<em>Beneath the El she starts to sway</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Down in Whitetown</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Johnny&#8217;s just trying to make his way</em><br />\n<em>He&#8217;s got a job but mister it don&#8217;t pay</em><br />\n<em>He sits and counts the scars</em><br />\n<em>On a stool down the end of a Whitetown bar</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>And the old men here piss their lives away</em><br />\n<em>Drinking and joking about their cop-fighting days</em><br />\n<em>Ain&#8217;t no answers here, just the past and fear</em><br />\n<em>Of spending the rest of your days</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Down in Whitetown</em></p>\n<p>So color me surprised. And delighted: Bruce turned &#8220;Whitetown&#8221; into a wonderful song that would have been a delightful addition to\u00a0<em>Working on a Dream</em>.
