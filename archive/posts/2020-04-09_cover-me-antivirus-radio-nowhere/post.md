Bonus post today, because this project is too great and too urgent to wait:

Even in the country most tragically impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, music continues.

More than thirty musicians from all over Italy (and a few from elsewhere) have come together–virtually of course–to create an epic jam video to raise money for the Italian Red Cross and the Lazzaro Spallanzani National Institute for Infectious Diseases.

Led by Sebastiano Cavallo, they call their project **Antivirus: Rock Strikes Corona**, and the song they chose to cover is Bruce Springsteen’s “[Radio Nowhere](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/08/01/roll-of-the-dice-radio-nowhere/)“–a song that resonates right now in an entirely different way than when Bruce first released it.

It’s a fantastic cover–all the more impressive for the logistics required for 30+ musicians to collaborate remotely.

I know we all have to be thoughtful about how we support our families, communities, and the world right now, but if you’re moved to donate to Sebastiano’s cause (I just did)–you can do so [here](https://www.gofundme.com/f/antivirus-rock-strikes-corona?utm_source=customer&utm_medium=copy_link-tip&utm_campaign=p_cp+share-sheet).

Thanks for the music and your activism, Sebastiano–stay healthy, and best of luck with your project!
