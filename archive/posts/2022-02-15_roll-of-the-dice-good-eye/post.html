<p>Bruce Springsteen was singing the blues long before he signed his first record deal, but it took him more than a quarter-century to commit a true blues song to vinyl.</p>
<p>“Good Eye” is as bluesy as rock and roll gets.</p>

<p>Conceived and recorded in true Chicago fashion (except for perhaps the harmonica loop shortcut Bruce uses throughout the track), “Good Eye” is a deceptively simple track. Musically, it storms and stomps; lyrically it howls and wails. Bruce makes arguably his best use to date of the bullet microphone he was so fond of in the mid-aughts, producing vocal distortion that further shades his already dark lyrics.</p>
<p>About those lyrics: Bruce wrote a total of six lines for a three-minute song. It’s a testament to his economical songwriting skill that he says as much in those six lines as he did in the six verses of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/06/09/roll-of-the-dice-cautious-man/">Cautious Man</a>” two decades earlier.</p>
<p>And that’s not an arbitrary comparison: one can make a strong argument that “Good Eye” and “Cautious Man” are thematically the same song.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>I was standing by the river where the cold black water runs</em><br/>
<em>I was standing by the river where the cold black water runs</em><br/>
<em>I had my good eye to the dark and my blind eye to the sun</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>I had all the earthly riches, I had each and every one</em><br/>
<em>I had all the earthly riches, I had each and every one</em><br/>
<em>But I had my good eye to the dark and my blind eye to the sun</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Well I swore to you my darling, that you were the only one</em><br/>
<em>Yes I swore to you my darling, you were the only one</em><br/>
<em>I had my good eye to the dark and my blind eye to the sun</em></p>
<p>The key to understanding “Good Eye” is to understand the line that closes each verse: <em>I had my good eye to the dark and my blind eye to the sun.</em></p>
<p><em>I’m watching the darkness, not the light</em>, our narrator tells us. <em>I’m surrendering to the temptations of <strong>more</strong></em><strong>. </strong><em>More earthly possessions, when I already have all I need. More  pleasures of the flesh, when I already have the one I love. </em></p>
<p>That’s it. That’s the song: <em>I had it it all, and I lost it all, because I gave in to my darkest desires.</em></p>
<p>“Cautious Man” features a narrator still struggling against those urges; “Good Eye” introduces us to one who has already surrendered.</p>
<p>Bruce implicitly acknowledged the linkage when he performed “Good Eye” in concert for the first and only official time (after two rehearsal show outings) at the Working on a Dream Tour opener in San Jose on April 1, 2009.</p>
<p>In the clip below, you’ll hear a distorted Bruce reference the love and fear tattoos Bill Horton bears in “Cautious Man” (which itself was an homage to the 1955 film <em>Night of the Hunter</em>) before launching into an extended jam that’s twice as long as the album track.</p>

<p>“Good Eye” gathered steam and power in each of its three stage outings; even on the album, it sounds tailor-made for an arena. Why Bruce chose to drop it immediately after the tour opener is a question I can’t answer.</p>
<p>“Good Eye” has been absent ever since that 2009 tour opener, but it’s a solid if under-the-radar blues rocker just begging to be brought out again.</p>
