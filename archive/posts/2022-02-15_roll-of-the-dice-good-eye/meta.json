Musically, it storms and stomps; lyrically it howls and wails. Bruce makes arguably his best use to date of the bullet microphone he was so fond of in the mid-aughts, producing vocal distortion that further shades his already dark lyrics.</p>\n<p>About those lyrics: Bruce wrote a total of six lines for a three-minute song. It&#8217;s a testament to his economical songwriting skill that he says as much in those six lines as he did in the six verses of &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/06/09/roll-of-the-dice-cautious-man/\">Cautious Man</a>&#8221; two decades earlier.</p>\n<p>And that&#8217;s not an arbitrary comparison: one can make a strong argument that &#8220;Good Eye&#8221; and &#8220;Cautious Man&#8221; are thematically the same song.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I was standing by the river where the cold black water runs</em><br />\n<em>I was standing by the river where the cold black water runs</em><br />\n<em>I had my good eye to the dark and my blind eye to the sun</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I had all the earthly riches, I had each and every one</em><br />\n<em>I had all the earthly riches, I had each and every one</em><br />\n<em>But I had my good eye to the dark and my blind eye to the sun</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well I swore to you my darling, that you were the only one</em><br />\n<em>Yes I swore to you my darling, you were the only one</em><br />\n<em>I had my good eye to the dark and my blind eye to the sun</em></p>\n<p>The key to understanding &#8220;Good Eye&#8221; is to understand the line that closes each verse:\u00a0<em>I had my good eye to the dark and my blind eye to the sun.</em></p>\n<p><em>I&#8217;m watching the darkness, not the light</em>, our narrator tells us.\u00a0<em>I&#8217;m surrendering to the temptations of\u00a0<strong>more</strong></em><strong>.\u00a0</strong><em>More earthly possessions, when I already have all I need. More\u00a0 pleasures of the flesh, when I already have the one I love.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>That&#8217;s it. That&#8217;s the song:\u00a0<em>I had it it all, and I lost it all, because I gave in to my darkest desires.</em></p>\n<p>&#8220;Cautious Man&#8221; features a narrator still struggling against those urges; &#8220;Good Eye&#8221; introduces us to one who has already surrendered.</p>\n<p>Bruce implicitly acknowledged the linkage when he performed &#8220;Good Eye&#8221; in concert for the first and only official time (after two rehearsal show outings) at the Working on a Dream Tour opener in San Jose on April 1, 2009.</p>\n<p>In the clip below, you&#8217;ll hear a distorted Bruce reference the love and fear tattoos Bill Horton bears in &#8220;Cautious Man&#8221; (which itself was an homage to the 1955 film <em>Night of the Hunter</em>) before launching into an extended jam that&#8217;s twice as long as the album track.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen Good Eye San Jose 01/04/2009\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BVLXCMvRB5E?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;Good Eye&#8221; gathered steam and power in each of its three stage outings; even on the album, it sounds tailor-made for an arena.
