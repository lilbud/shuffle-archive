Bruce has spoken at length about it on many occasions, including in this clip from Elvis Costello&#8217;s too short-lived <em>Spectacle\u00a0</em>series.</p>\n<div id=\"v-ucFmhKLJ-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='426' src='https://videopress.com/embed/ucFmhKLJ?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>What&#8217;s surprising, though, is how long it took for Bruce and Sam to share a stage together, especially after Sam appeared on three of Bruce&#8217;s studio tracks (&#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/05/30/roll-of-the-dice-mans-job/\">Man&#8217;s Job</a>,&#8221; &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/07/25/roll-of-the-dice-real-world/\">Real World</a>,&#8221; and &#8220;Soul Driver&#8221;) in the early nineties.</p>\n<p>Sam made a brief guest appearance on &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/07/25/meeting-across-the-river-bruce-springsteen-and-sam-moore-soul-man/\">Soul Man</a>&#8221; during the Reunion Tour, but it took a few more years before the two legendary bandleaders had a chance to truly team up in style.</p>\n<p>By December 2003, Bruce Springsteen&#8217;s holiday shows had become a firmly entrenched tradition. Now in their third year (they took a year off in 2002 due to the demands of the Rising Tour), the annual stand of benefit concerts had grown in length, cast, and anything-can-happen power.</p>\n<p>More often than not, anything did. On the evening of December 7th, Bruce took the stage with the usual holiday show suspects: the Max Weinberg 7, much of the E Street Band, Southside Johnny, Willie Nile, Garland Jeffreys, Bobby Bandiera, and more.</p>\n<p>But there were a few new faces this year as well: Jesse Malin made his performing debut with Bruce at these shows, and Jon Bon Jovi made a surprise guest appearance.</p>\n<p>But for my money, the highlight of the show was Bruce&#8217;s extended mini-set with Sam Moore. Bruce and Sam reprised their &#8220;Soul Man&#8221; performance from the Reunion Tour, but only after first performing three of Sam and Dave&#8217;s greatest hits: &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/04/24/matr-bruce-springsteen-and-sam-moore-hold-on-im-comin/\">Hold On, I&#8217;m Comin&#8217;</a>,&#8221; &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/05/26/matr-bruce-springsteen-and-sam-moore-when-something-is-wrong-with-my-baby/\">When Something is Wrong With My Baby</a>,&#8221; and &#8220;I Thank You.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The last of those, &#8220;I Thank You&#8221; was also Sam and Dave&#8217;s final single for storied Stax Records. It scored them another Top Ten hit, peaking at #9 on the Hot 100 and #4 on the R&amp;B charts.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Sam &amp; Dave &quot;I Thank You&quot;\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OLKiyo48VJI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>When Bruce and Sam tackled &#8220;I Thank You&#8221; together, Bruce quickly and graciously ceded the bandleader role to Sam, and the result was magic.</p>\n<p>In the wonderful clip below, keep your eye on Bruce during the close-ups&#8211;the mix of wonder, joy, excitement, and humility in performing with one of his idols is all right there on his face.</p>\n<div id=\"v-9mXCbgla-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='568' src='https://videopress.com/embed/9mXCbgla?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>(The clip didn&#8217;t cut off before the end&#8211;they just segued at that point into &#8220;Soul Man.&#8221;)</p>\n<p>Sam appeared each night of the stand, and each appearance was a showstopper.
