meta-description: One of the last songs Buckwheat Zydeco recorded in the studio was a reggae reinvention of Bruce’s torch song, “Back in Your Arms.” And it works.

The late, great Buckwheat Zydeco covered one of Bruce’s more obscure tracks on his final studio album, 

*Lay Your Burden Down.*

For an artist with a distinct sound of his own, Zydeco’s version of “” is surprisingly faithful to the original… for about thirty seconds. Then Zydeco shifts the song into a reggae arrangement and never looks back.

Amazingly, it works. I’d never have imagined Bruce’s R&B torch song recast as a reggae ballad, but that’s the wonderful thing about covers: sometimes they deliver surprises that cast new light on an old favorite.
