Those B-sides included two songs Bruce would eventually debut during the Born in the U.S.A. Tour (&#8220;Sugarland&#8221; and &#8220;Follow That Dream&#8221;), along with three &#8220;lost tracks&#8221; that wouldn&#8217;t ever be performed live and wouldn&#8217;t see official release for more than four decades: &#8220;Don&#8217;t Back Down,&#8221; &#8220;Little Girl (Like You),&#8221; and &#8220;One Love.&#8221;</p>\n<p>When I wrote about &#8220;Little Girl (Like You)&#8221; last spring, I wasn&#8217;t very kind in my assessment. &#8220;One Love&#8221; is better (faint praise that may be), but it still suffers from an overly simple conceit, a lack of imagination, and Bruce&#8217;s newfound fascination with drum machines. Take a listen to the original home demo:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen  One love\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IyHiN-dF04A?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;One Love&#8221; doesn&#8217;t demand much in the way of lyrical analysis; Bruce never even dips a toe into metaphor.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>One girl, one love</em><br />\n<em>One dream in our heart</em><br />\n<em>Two hearts as one</em><br />\n<em>One hope, never to be torn apart</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Yeah, come on baby, rock me way down low</em><br />\n<em>Shake me darling, shake me, don&#8217;t let me go</em><br />\n<em>You&#8217;re the one, yeah, you&#8217;re the one for me</em></p>\n<p>By the time we&#8217;ve finished that first verse, we pretty much get the idea: like the man says (here and elsewhere), two hearts are better than one.\u00a0 But just to make sure that we don&#8217;t miss the point, the song continues:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>One dream, one dream</em><br />\n<em>Is all, is all I need</em><br />\n<em>One reason to believe</em><br />\n<em>In you I&#8217;ve found the thing I need</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Once I was alone</em><br />\n<em>So alone, so all alone</em><br />\n<em>Then you came along</em><br />\n<em>With a love you said I could call home</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Come on baby, rock me all night long</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;ve been searching for you for so long</em><br />\n<em>You&#8217;re the one, yeah, you&#8217;re the one for me</em></p>\n<p>When\u00a0<em>Tracks II: The Lost Albums</em> was announced with &#8220;One Love&#8221; included, I wondered if we&#8217;d finally hear a more polished version of the song. In a sense, I guess we do: the official release lops off the extended intro and fade-out, so the album version is considerably shorter.
