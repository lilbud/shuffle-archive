<p>The last of these was his 1986 LP <em>Velvet &amp; Steel,</em> which featured a very eighties devotional entitled “Hymn to Him.”</p>

<p>“Hymn to Him” never charted (none of Dion’s Christian music did), but Dion never gave up on it. He resurrected it for his latest album, <em>Blues With Friends</em>, paring back the musical arrangement to better serve his lyrics.</p>
<p>The backing vocals were pared back, too. Gone is the original backing choir, replaced by a soulful, mostly wordless vocal by Patti Scialfa, who Dion beseeched to provide a new arrangement to suit the new track.</p>
<p>“I just wanted her to hum along on some of the solos, but she had a different idea,” Dion told <em>Rolling Stone</em>. “She had a whole other arrangement in mind and did this layering kind of thing and I just have to say she captured the wind of the holy spirit, truly something beautiful and sublime.”</p>
<p>Patti’s husband was taken by it, too–so much so that he was moved to add his own contribution, a mid-song guitar solo.</p>

<p>“Hymn to Him” was released as an online video single on May 1, 2020, a month in advance of <em>Blues With Friends, </em>to a generally positive reception.</p>
<p>And while it doesn’t seem like a live performance is on the horizon any time soon, we can be grateful for one more beautiful piece of music from an otherwise mostly quiet year.</p>
