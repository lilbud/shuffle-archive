<p>He died way too young at the age of 21, but he left us with a string of rockabilly classics that would influence generations of artists to come.</p>
<p>Eddie Cochran’s biggest hit was “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/01/02/cover-me-summertime-blues/">Summertime Blues</a>,” a song Springsteen covered as far back as the Darkness Tour. But that’s not the only song of Cochran’s that Bruce covered.</p>
<p>On the evening of July 23, 1982, Bruce joined rockabilly band Stray Cats on guitar at The Fast Lane for a one-time-only cover of Cochran’s “Twenty Flight Rock.”</p>

<p>Cochran released “Twenty Flight Rock” as a single the following year, but it never became a hit.</p>

<p>On July 6, 1957, a fifteen-year-old Liverpool musician chose “Twenty Flight Rock” as his first song for his audition for a local band called The Quarrymen–and he played it so well that the young Paul McCartney was asked to join The Quarrymen by its leader, one John Lennon.</p>
