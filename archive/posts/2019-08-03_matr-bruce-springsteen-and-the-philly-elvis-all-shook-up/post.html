<p>Normally, when I write a post about Bruce covering another artist, I provide a little backstory about the song. Sometimes I also add some color commentary about the album and the artist, along with an angle on why that song is a natural or surprising choice for Bruce.</p>
<p>But when it comes to Bruce’s one-time-only cover of Elvis Presley’s “All Shook Up,” there’s really no point to doing any of the above.</p>
<p>Because this story isn’t about Bruce, and it isn’t about Elvis. Well, not the original Elvis, at least.</p>
<p>This story belongs to Nick Ferraro–or as Bruce dubbed him, “The Philly Elvis.”</p>
<p>And although I was there in the pit that night only a few feet away to witness it, I couldn’t possibly tell his story any better than Nick himself. So watch and listen–it’s a remarkable story that will make any fan’s heart race with excitement and shared joy.</p>

<p>Pretty awesome, isn’t it? Here’s the entire performance uncut and with better sound for a more visceral experience:</p>

<p>And yeah… the original 1957 version is pretty great, too.</p>
