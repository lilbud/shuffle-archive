<p>Most of Bruce’s outtakes are partially-formed works-in-progress, lyrical and musical ancestors to released songs we know and love. (Bruce certainly likes to cross-pollinate his lyrics.)</p>
<p>Decades down the line, it seems like most of the really interesting ones have been released in box sets and compilations. Every once in a while, though, we come across a fully-formed unreleased gem that shines in its own right and deserves some love.</p>
<p>Enter “Jesse.”</p>
<p>Recorded with crystal clarity at the apartment of Jim Cretecos (Mike Appel’s business partner), “Jesse” is a superb document of Bruce’s early acoustic songwriting. (See my earlier essay on “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/01/09/roll-of-the-dice-hollywood-kids/">Hollywood Kids</a>” for another lost Springsteen original from this session. “Jesse” is much stronger, though.)</p>
<p>If you listen closely, you’ll hear the first evidence of what would eventually become “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/04/26/roll-of-the-dice-4th-of-july-asbury-park-sandy/">4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)</a>.” (The meter is the same, and the third line of each verse is musically almost identical to “Sandy.”)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3eIuZXI4rTc">Watch on Youtube: Bruce Springsteen - Jesse</a></p>
<p>We don’t know exactly when Bruce wrote “Jesse,” but we know he was only 22 when he recorded it, and we can already see some trademark Springsteenian devices in play:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Oh Jesse, you better start thinking about saving your neck</em><br/>
<em>Oh Jesse, you put on that leather jacket like you put on respect</em></p>
<p>Ooh, that’s a perfect line, and a great example of Bruce’s skill with metaphor. We’ll see him employ it to great effect in the first two verses.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>You got cleats on your boots and a woman who shoots every time you shuffle out the stage door</em></p>
<p>This line has DNA from <em>two</em> songs that would end up on Bruce’s second album: musically, it’s a dead ringer for “Sandy,” and those boots with cleats would be handed down to Billy in “New York City Serenade.”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Darling Jesse, ah do you know what it’s all for</em></p>
<p>And here we have the song’s central premise established, and it’s an unsurprising one: a young musician is starting to realize that the lure of the stage and the demands of the road aren’t particularly compatible with a domestic relationship. What <em>is</em> surprising is that that Bruce is familiar with that–one wonders if he based the song on some of his older cohorts, an early example, perhaps, of Bruce’s empathetic abilities.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Ah Jesse, your manager brought by them eight-by-ten glossies of your band</em><br/>
<em>Oh Jesse, he says you wear a cross ’round your neck and come on with nails in your hands</em></p>
<p>Check off another classic Springsteen device: the religious metaphor. Jesse feels like he can’t ever give enough to his job or to his family–he’s in a no-win situation and is being crucified by both. Jesse comes alive on stage though, feeling the narcotic hit of respect and adoration:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>With your insides showing and your New York band blowing them old Chicago blues</em><br/>
<em>Ah Jesse, can’t you see you’re the one, Jesse</em><br/>
<em>Ah sonny, this time it’s you</em></p>
<p>Watch what Bruce does now in the next verse:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Well Jesse, your child is slobbering all over your pants</em><br/>
<em>And Jesse, your wife has fallen into a trance</em><br/>
<em>She’s got eyes that tell no lies, she’s seen so many wars</em><br/>
<em>Ah be a good boy, Jesse, tell her she don’t have to look no more</em></p>
<p>Bruce has abruptly abandoned all metaphor, reverting to stark, plain language. At first the line “your child is slobbering all over your pants” feels crude and artless. But that’s deliberate: Bruce is stripping away all of the artifice, romanticism and illusion of life on stage in order to contrast it with the harsh reality of a struggling musician’s home life and his beleaguered wife, who is just trying to survive each day as a single parent.</p>
<p>Jesse knows he should be there for them.</p>
<p>But…</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Well Jesse, he knows all the tricks to get the crowd reeling</em><br/>
<em>Oh and Jesse, yeah he rocks ’em with that old soul feeling</em><br/>
<em>And he walks off the stage in a self-adoring haze and gets shoved right out the door</em><br/>
<em>Whoa Jesse, can’t you see now boy that that’s what it’s all about, Jesse</em><br/>
<em>Not even time to do that old played out encore</em><br/>
<em>Oh Jesse</em></p>
<p>Take that last verse in one more time–it’s brilliant.</p>
<p>We can’t be sure here whether Jesse is back on-stage or still at home, but either way: he’s performing.</p>
<p>He knows how to lift his family’s spirits in the moment–he lights up the room with his energy and charisma, but just like on-stage, he doesn’t hang around for long. Pretty soon he’s on his way out again–no time for an encore–off to continue his endless cycle of living on stage and performing at home.</p>
<p>“Jesse” is a startlingly mature and sophisticated song by a <em>very</em> young Springteen, and it deserves to be released. It’s certainly on par with his material on <a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2023/01/05/album-companion-greetings-from-asbury-park-n-j/"><em>Greetings From Asbury Park, N.J.</em></a>  and would play well acoustically in concert, too.</p>
<p>Here’s hoping we’ll see this one leave the vault someday.</p>
