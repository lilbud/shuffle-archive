(Bruce certainly likes to cross-pollinate his lyrics.)</p>\n<p>Decades down the line, it seems like most of the really interesting ones have been released in box sets and compilations. Every once in a while, though, we come across a fully-formed unreleased gem that shines in its own right and deserves some love.</p>\n<p>Enter &#8220;Jesse.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Recorded with crystal clarity at the apartment of Jim Cretecos (Mike Appel&#8217;s business partner), &#8220;Jesse&#8221; is a superb document of Bruce&#8217;s early acoustic songwriting. (See my earlier essay on &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/01/09/roll-of-the-dice-hollywood-kids/\">Hollywood Kids</a>&#8221; for another lost Springsteen original from this session. &#8220;Jesse&#8221; is much stronger, though.)</p>\n<p>If you listen closely, you&#8217;ll hear the first evidence of what would eventually become &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/04/26/roll-of-the-dice-4th-of-july-asbury-park-sandy/\">4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)</a>.&#8221; (The meter is the same, and the third line of each verse is musically almost identical to &#8220;Sandy.&#8221;)</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Jesse\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3eIuZXI4rTc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>We don&#8217;t know exactly when Bruce wrote &#8220;Jesse,&#8221; but we know he was only 22 when he recorded it, and we can already see some trademark Springsteenian devices in play:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Oh Jesse, you better start thinking about saving your neck</em><br />\n<em>Oh Jesse, you put on that leather jacket like you put on respect</em></p>\n<p>Ooh, that&#8217;s a perfect line, and a great example of Bruce&#8217;s skill with metaphor. We&#8217;ll see him employ it to great effect in the first two verses.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>You got cleats on your boots and a woman who shoots every time you shuffle out the stage door</em></p>\n<p>This line has DNA from\u00a0<em>two</em> songs that would end up on Bruce&#8217;s second album: musically, it&#8217;s a dead ringer for &#8220;Sandy,&#8221; and those boots with cleats would be handed down to Billy in &#8220;New York City Serenade.&#8221;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Darling Jesse, ah do you know what it&#8217;s all for</em></p>\n<p>And here we have the song&#8217;s central premise established, and it&#8217;s an unsurprising one: a young musician is starting to realize that the lure of the stage and the demands of the road aren&#8217;t particularly compatible with a domestic relationship. What\u00a0<em>is</em> surprising is that that Bruce is familiar with that&#8211;one wonders if he based the song on some of his older cohorts, an early example, perhaps, of Bruce&#8217;s empathetic abilities.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Ah Jesse, your manager brought by them eight-by-ten glossies of your band</em><br />\n<em>Oh Jesse, he says you wear a cross &#8217;round your neck and come on with nails in your hands</em></p>\n<p>Check off another classic Springsteen device: the religious metaphor. Jesse feels like he can&#8217;t ever give enough to his job or to his family&#8211;he&#8217;s in a no-win situation and is being crucified by both. Jesse comes alive on stage though, feeling the narcotic hit of respect and adoration:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>With your insides showing and your New York band blowing them old Chicago blues</em><br />\n<em>Ah Jesse, can&#8217;t you see you&#8217;re the one, Jesse</em><br />\n<em>Ah sonny, this time it&#8217;s you</em></p>\n<p>Watch what Bruce does now in the next verse:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Well Jesse, your child is slobbering all over your pants</em><br />\n<em>And Jesse, your wife has fallen into a trance</em><br />\n<em>She&#8217;s got eyes that tell no lies, she&#8217;s seen so many wars</em><br />\n<em>Ah be a good boy, Jesse, tell her she don&#8217;t have to look no more</em></p>\n<p>Bruce has abruptly abandoned all metaphor, reverting to stark, plain language. At first the line &#8220;your child is slobbering all over your pants&#8221; feels crude and artless. But that&#8217;s deliberate: Bruce is stripping away all of the artifice, romanticism and illusion of life on stage in order to contrast it with the harsh reality of a struggling musician&#8217;s home life and his beleaguered wife, who is just trying to survive each day as a single parent.</p>\n<p>Jesse knows he should be there for them.</p>\n<p>But&#8230;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Well Jesse, he knows all the tricks to get the crowd reeling</em><br />\n<em>Oh and Jesse, yeah he rocks &#8217;em with that old soul feeling</em><br />\n<em>And he walks off the stage in a self-adoring haze and gets shoved right out the door</em><br />\n<em>Whoa Jesse, can&#8217;t you see now boy that that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s all about, Jesse</em><br />\n<em>Not even time to do that old played out encore</em><br />\n<em>Oh Jesse</em></p>\n<p>Take that last verse in one more time&#8211;it&#8217;s brilliant.</p>\n<p>We can&#8217;t be sure here whether Jesse is back on-stage or still at home, but either way: he&#8217;s performing.</p>\n<p>He knows how to lift his family&#8217;s spirits in the moment&#8211;he lights up the room with his energy and charisma, but just like on-stage, he doesn&#8217;t hang around for long. Pretty soon he&#8217;s on his way out again&#8211;no time for an encore&#8211;off to continue his endless cycle of living on stage and performing at home.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Jesse&#8221; is a startlingly mature and sophisticated song by a\u00a0<em>very</em> young Springteen, and it deserves to be released. It&#8217;s certainly on par with his material on\u00a0<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2023/01/05/album-companion-greetings-from-asbury-park-n-j/\"><em>Greetings From Asbury Park, N.J.</em></a>\u00a0 and would play well acoustically in concert, too.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s hoping we&#8217;ll see this one leave the vault someday.</p>\n<p><strong>Jesse</strong><br />\n<strong>Recorded:</strong> April-May 1972<br />\n<strong>Never released</strong><br />\n<strong>Never performed</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a9 August 31, 2018</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>&#8220;Jesse&#8221;
