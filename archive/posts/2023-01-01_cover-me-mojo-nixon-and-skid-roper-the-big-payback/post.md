Bonus Cover Me post today, since I totally had a brainfart and mis-attributed Greg Kin’s live cover of “” to John Eddie earlier. (That post has since been retracted, redirected, and merged with my post from last year about Kihn’s version of that song. My apologies–once in a while, the daily blog deadline combined with my day job get the better of me!)

I’m a sucker for covers of obscure Springsteen songs, and they don’t come much more obscure than “,” the B-side of an under-the-radar single, re-issued on a bonus disc of a limited-edition compilation.

[The Big Payback](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/11/11/roll-of-the-dice-the-big-payback/)

But it’s a great song, and Mojo Nixon and Skid Roper did a terrific cover of it back in 1985, even if it’s just a over the top given the subject matter.
