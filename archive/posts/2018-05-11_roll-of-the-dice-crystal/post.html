(See “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/04/22/roll-of-the-dice-until-the-rain-comes/">Until the Rain Comes</a>” for the backstory.)</p>

<p>Crystal is the second song from that notebook. We may never know whether it was a ballad or a rocker, but the lyrics are about what you’d expect from a teenage Bruce, an ode to the elusive mystery girl who lights his world afire as she nears and saps the color and brightness as she walks away.</p>
<p>It would be easy to dismiss this a throwaway song, but the lyrics function either literally (the object of a high school crush walking up to and past a boy too shy to speak to her) or metaphorically (an entire relationship in fast forward):</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Hey there, Crystal, walking through your marble halls, I can’t see you at all</em><br/>
<em>Hey there, Crystal, I can hear you calling me near</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Now I hear you coming, I hear you coming to me, to me, hey Crystal</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Hey there, Crystal, you kissed the green summer leaves, you created the trees</em><br/>
<em>Hey there, Crystal, you’re as free as the sea, help bring life to me</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Now I hear you coming, I hear you coming to me, to me, hey Crystal</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>I’m lost in the center of your resistance, united as one in your wisdom, hey Crystal</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Hey there, Crystal, I can feel you nearing to me</em><br/>
<em>Hey there, Crystal, you’re fading away into a cloudy day</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Now I hear you coming, I hear you coming to me, to me, hey Crystal</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Goin’ from me, hey Crystal, you’re fading, you’re fading</em></p>
<p>That central line (“I’m lost in the center of your resistance”) almost certainly was intended to be the song’s fulcrum, and it’s a very clever literary device.</p>
<p>I would have liked to have seen what this would have developed into.</p>
