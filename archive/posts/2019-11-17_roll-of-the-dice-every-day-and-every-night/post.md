Sometimes the path to perfection is long and winding.

I broke down “[Janey, Don’t You Lose Heart](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/04/06/roll-of-the-dice-janey-dont-you-lose-heart/)” last spring, and at the time I noted that we can trace the melody and lyrics of this 1983 track to a home demo called “[True Love Is Hard to Come By](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/05/19/roll-of-the-dice-true-love-is-hard-to-come-by/)” recorded a year earlier.

But we can go even farther back still: Here’s a home demo that goes all the way back to the early days of the River sessions.

We’ll call it “Every Day and Every Night,” because those are the only lyrics in the entire song. But it’s not the lyrics we’re interested in here–it’s the melody. For those of us who love Bruce’s 1985 “Janey” B-side, this early work in progress should sound *very* familiar.
