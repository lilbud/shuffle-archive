Lucinda Williams has been covering Bruce’s music in her concerts for years (and teaming up with him on stage once as well), but she’s only recorded one of his songs in the studio.

On her 2016 album, *The Ghosts of Highway 20*, Lucinda recorded her cover of “[Factory](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/10/31/roll-of-the-dice-factory/).” Her arrangement transplants the song from New Jersey to a lonely western town, but she finds and keeps tight hold of the purpose and the price that’s at the heart of the song.

By the time she recorded the song in 2015, Lucinda had already been performing “Factory” in her concerts. If you were lucky, you might have caught one of those shows, like this one in Perth from 2013:
