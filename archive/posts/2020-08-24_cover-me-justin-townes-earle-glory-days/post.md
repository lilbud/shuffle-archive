Oh man… I don’t have the words tonight.

I’ve had three of Justin Townes Earle’s wonderful covers on my to-blog list for ages, just waiting for the right inspiration or mood to strike.

I never for a moment thought it would take a circumstance like this, but like the man says: the days, they pass by in the wink of an eye.

Rest in peace, Justin.
