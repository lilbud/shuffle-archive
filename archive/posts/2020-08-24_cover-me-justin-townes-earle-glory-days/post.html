<p>Oh man… I don’t have the words tonight.</p>
<p>I’ve had three of Justin Townes Earle’s wonderful covers on my to-blog list for ages, just waiting for the right inspiration or mood to strike.</p>
<p>I never for a moment thought it would take a circumstance like this, but like the man says: the days, they pass by in the wink of an eye.</p>
<p>Rest in peace, Justin.</p>
