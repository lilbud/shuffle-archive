We’re taking the way-way-WAY-back machine today:

“Will You Love Me Tomorrow,” written and recorded by Carole King, covered here by…

Dr. Zoom and the Sonic Boom!

Bruce’s shortest-lived band, Dr. Zoom and the Sonic Boom lasted all of two gigs, but it’s not hard to hear glimmers of the future E Street Band: Bruce, Stevie, Garry, Vini, and David Sancious are already present, and while the Big Man hadn’t yet made the scene, there are saxophones (two) in the house.

On stage, there were almost as many backup singers as musicians, and while you’re picturing that assemblage while you listen to this performance, add to your mental vision an on-stage Monopoly game and baton twirler (seriously), and you’ll pretty much have the scene captured.

(Note: I realize that this song was originally recorded by The Shirelles in 1960, but this arrangement is far more similar to Carole King’s version on . Given that was released in February 1971, just a few months before this Dr. Zoom performance, I’m inclined to think that Bruce had Carole’s version in mind rather than the original Shirelles recording. And since Carole also co-wrote the song, I’m crediting this cover to her.)
