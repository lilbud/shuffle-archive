And not just any story, but the near legendary recollection of the first time he met Clarence Clemons. It&#8217;s funny and moving, and then comes the moment where he leans toward Clarence, rests his arm on his shoulder, and recreates the iconic album pose from 34 years prior that first recognized and celebrated their deep friendship and made it one of the most famous in rock and roll.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen Growing Up Buffalo,NY 11/22/09\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xg-o6JqRL7E?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>It was an unexpected and absolutely electrifying moment.</p>\n<p>And it felt important. Significant in ways we couldn&#8217;t understand at the time, and Bruce almost certainly couldn&#8217;t have either. And yet, he did.</p>\n<p>It was Clarence&#8217;s last public concert appearance with the E Street Band. He died following a stroke in 2011. Bruce couldn&#8217;t have known it at the time, but if he had, I think he would have played a show exactly like this one.</p>\n<p>Going into the show that night, the rumor and fear among fans was that this was the swan song of the E Street Band&#8211;the last show of what would inevitably become known as their last tour. I don&#8217;t remember how the rumor started, but I remember believing it and feeling like I absolutely\u00a0<em>had\u00a0</em>to be there.</p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t know that not only would there be at least three more tours ahead of us, but even four-hour-plus marathon shows that would make setlists like this one pale by comparison.</p>\n<p>But it didn&#8217;t take long for Bruce to dispel any notion of retirement. Early in the show he promised that the E Street Band was going away &#8220;for just a little while&#8221; and the encores of &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/02/14/roll-of-the-dice-ill-work-for-your-love/\">I&#8217;ll Work For Your Love</a>,&#8221; &#8220;Higher and Higher&#8221; and &#8220;Rockin&#8217; All Over the World&#8221; sent a message and a promise loud and clear: there would be many, many shows to come.</p>\n<p>But in a sense, it very much was the end of an era. The next time any of us saw the E Street Band again (other than a select lucky few who witnessed a private promotional concert in late 2010), it would be missing a big piece of its heart and soul.</p>\n<p>Like all families, both the band and the fans would mourn, heal, grow, and go on to new heights and unforeseen triumphs.</p>\n<p>But at the time, all we knew was that we&#8217;d just seen a magical show by our favorite band, and <em>just in case</em> it was our last, we stayed to watch them take their final bows.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Springsteen WOAD Tour - Buffalo 2009 - Final Bow\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OwIkzgca7dA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Bruce and Clarence took theirs together,\u00a0 and then they walked off into the darkness, arm in arm.</p>\n</div>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>No one could have known that this was Clarence&#8217;s final show.
