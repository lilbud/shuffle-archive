No jaw-dropping debuts or for-the-ages performances, just a solid, fun set list, loose performances, and surprising sequencing&#8211;starting with the opener.</p>\n<p>&#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/07/16/roll-of-the-dice-shackled-and-drawn/\">Shackled and Drawn</a>&#8221; is my favorite song from\u00a0<em><a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2023/03/28/album-companion-wrecking-ball/\">Wrecking Ball</a>,\u00a0</em>and it was the song I looked forward to the most at each show. I was shocked and delighted when Bruce opened the show with it that night&#8211;and it worked perfectly as an opener. Check out the video below; the band took the stage in darkness, and Bruce led the crowd in an extended chant, building energy and anticipation through the initial chorus. The arena exploded when the band joined and the lights came on.</p>\n<div id=\"v-tSIP2IPy-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='426' src='https://videopress.com/embed/tSIP2IPy?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>&#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/10/28/roll-of-the-dice-out-in-the-street/\">Out in the Street</a>&#8221; followed (a traditional member of the opening pack), but Bruce threw another curve when he followed that with &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/12/21/roll-of-the-dice-hungry-heart/\">Hungry Heart,</a>&#8221; played slightly earlier in the set than usual, and setting the tone for a light-hearted, celebratory evening.</p>\n<div id=\"v-tKxNYA4j-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='426' src='https://videopress.com/embed/tKxNYA4j?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>Next came one of the intact cores of the Wrecking Ball Tour: the successive sequence of &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/12/25/roll-of-the-dice-we-take-care-of-our-own/\">We Take Care of Our Own,</a>&#8221; &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/08/12/roll-of-the-dice-wrecking-ball/\">Wrecking Ball</a>,&#8221; and &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/03/30/roll-of-the-dice-death-to-my-hometown/\">Death to My Hometown</a>.&#8221; I&#8217;m a big fan of the <a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2023/03/28/album-companion-wrecking-ball/\"><em>Wrecking Ball\u00a0</em></a>album, and I was delighted that this far into the tour, Bruce was still spotlighting so much new material.</p>\n<div id=\"v-eq7JohEx-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='426' src='https://videopress.com/embed/eq7JohEx?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>The emotional release of &#8220;My City of Ruins&#8221; was next, and Bruce&#8217;s mid-song speech tonight was particularly poignant.

Even Bruce&#8217;s regular &#8220;ghosts&#8221; speech felt more emotional that night, and Bruce often seemed lost in reflection.
