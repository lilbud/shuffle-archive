Then Jesse Malin re-introduced her to me more than a quarter-century later, and I fell in love all over again.</p>\n<p>At the tail end of 2002, former D Generation lead singer Jesse Malin released his debut solo album,\u00a0<em>The Fine Art of Self Destruction.\u00a0</em>With first-time producer Ryan Adams, Jesse recorded the album in a mere six days, but you&#8217;d never know it from the final product.</p>\n<p><em>The Fine Art of Self Destruction</em> easily ranks among the best albums released that year (a year that also brought us <em>The Rising</em>).\u00a0 As Bruce himself put it, &#8220;Jesse&#8217;s got one of those rare albums out these days that&#8217;s really an album&#8211;it&#8217;s got all good songs on it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Bruce was right: there&#8217;s not a single song on Jesse&#8217;s debut album that&#8217;s anything less than great, but if I had to vote for a standout track, it would have to be &#8220;Wendy.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"758\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eTt7unUzRm0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></div>\n<p>A perfect blend of punk and power pop, &#8220;Wendy&#8221; immediately became one of my all-time favorite rockers (by anyone) when I first heard Jesse perform it on a bootleg from Bruce&#8217;s 2003 holiday shows. How could you <em>not</em> fall in love with a girl with &#8220;country lips and Bacall style,&#8221; who &#8220;likes Tom Waits, the poet&#8217;s hat, sixties Kinks, and Kerouac?&#8221;</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been a Jesse Malin fan ever since.</p>\n<p>Oh, and that holiday show performance&#8211;that&#8217;s a must watch. It&#8217;s got just as much energy as the studio track (not surprising since the studio version was essentially recorded live), but with bonus Bruce backing vocals. Can&#8217;t beat that.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\"
