<p>“<a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/10/31/roll-of-the-dice-factory/">Factory</a>” is a difficult song to cover. Its melody, lyrics and structure are so minimalist that it can be tough to bring something new and distinct to the table when performing it.</p>
<p>And yet the song clearly strikes a chord for so many of us, so artists still take an occasional swing at it. Lucinda Williams nailed it in <a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/12/26/cover-me-lucinda-williams-factory/">her fresh approach</a> on her <em>Ghosts of Highway 20</em> album, but I’m fond of this more straightforward version by Deep Dark Woods as well:</p>

<p>Deep Dark Woods hail from Saskatoon, a far cry from the New Jersey factories that employed Douglas Springsteen and inspired his son to write this song. But that just demonstrates Bruce’s ability to tap into a universal theme: that work can give you purpose and sustenance, but it exacts a price in return.</p>
