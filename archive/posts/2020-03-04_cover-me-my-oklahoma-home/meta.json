The Cunninghams were born and raised in rural Oklahoma, where Sis worked both as a labor organizer and musician. Among the groups she performed with was Pete Seeger&#8217;s troupe, The Almanac Singers, leading to a lifelong friendship and business partnership in\u00a0<em>Broadside Magazine,\u00a0</em>a publishing haven for aspiring socially conscious folk singers. Seeger published his work in <em>Broadside</em>, as did Bob Dylan, Janis Ian, and others.</p>\n<p>Sis served as the magazine&#8217;s editor, and one of the songs published during her run was a song she and Bill wrote in 1961, just before the magazine started: &#8220;My Oklahoma Home.&#8221; A chronicle of the dust bowl experience, the song combined biting sarcasm with laugh-out-loud humor. Seeger recorded it pretty much on the spot.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"My Oklahoma Home Blowed Away (Live)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wWalEjevKJA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>But other than Seeger&#8217;s recording, &#8220;My Oklahoma Home&#8221; received very little attention from either the public or fellow recording artists.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s too bad, because there&#8217;s a wit on display in &#8220;My Oklahoma&#8221; home that makes us laugh even as we wince at its pointed social commentary. Cunningham got around to recording the song herself a few years later, and her version includes extra verses and some different phrasing.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Sis Cunningham - My Oklahoma Home It Blowed Away\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mDiZTYVpE58?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>As for Bruce&#8217;s version, he hews pretty closely to Seeger&#8217;s. In fact, lyrically the two versions are virtually identical. On an album where Bruce adapted, tweaked, or re-arranged almost every song (in the folk tradition), that makes &#8220;My Oklahoma Home&#8221; stand out.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s possible that Bruce&#8217;s literal translation had something to do with the fact that &#8220;My Oklahoma Home&#8221; was one of the very first songs recorded for the album, almost nine years before the album&#8217;s release.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"My Oklahoma Home\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5QnpQMrf7Qo?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Bruce&#8217;s arrangement rolls merrily along, carried by Charlie Giordano&#8217;s accordion, Mark Clifford&#8217;s banjo, and the band&#8217;s exuberant backing vocals. The effect is so buoyant that the listener notices only the humor in the moment&#8211;but a half-second after, we feel the bite.</p>\n<p>Although Bruce performed &#8220;My Oklahoma Home&#8221; at four Asbury Park rehearsal shows before taking it on tour, he gave it a proper concert debut at the New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival, a show that immediately cemented itself among the best of Bruce&#8217;s career.</p>\n<p>And even this early on, fans knew exactly what to do during the chorus, much to Bruce&#8217;s delight:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"My Oklahoma Home (Live at the New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival, 2006)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CMR2N6PIWdw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;My Oklahoma Home&#8221; was a set list staple throughout the Seeger Sessions Tour, a nightly highlight that maintained resonance with those still struggling to make ends meet in a challenging environment.
