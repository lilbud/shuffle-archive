This was the first public E Street Band concert without Clarence Clemons, and no one know&#8211;least of all Bruce&#8211;how the crowd would react to his absence, and to the torch being gently passed onward.</p>\n<p>Bruce gave himself a third-person introduction (that would be one of the first things to drop) before launching into &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/12/25/roll-of-the-dice-we-take-care-of-our-own/\">We Take Care of Our Own,</a>&#8221; which became an instant favorite concert anthem. &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/08/12/roll-of-the-dice-wrecking-ball/\">Wrecking Ball</a>&#8221; had more resonance now than it did when I first heard at the tail end of the Working on a Dream tour&#8211;Clarence&#8217;s absence loomed large. And even larger during &#8220;My City of Ruins,&#8221; where the audience had a chance to momentarily grieve before Bruce firmly re-established the Big Man&#8217;s spiritual presence.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Kick Off of The Wrecking Ball Tour 2012 Atlanta\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/N23UCzVe8oU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen- My City of Ruins- Atlanta 3/18/12\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ca3vy25izfw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>One of the short-lived gems from this show: the premiere of &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/06/10/roll-of-the-dice-easy-money/\">Easy Money</a>&#8221; a foot-stomping companion piece to &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/06/04/roll-of-the-dice-atlantic-city/\">Atlantic City</a>.&#8221; Another was the <a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/11/20/cover-me-the-way-you-do-the-things-you-do/\">Apollo Medley</a>&#8211;a delightful surprise holdover from the preview show.
