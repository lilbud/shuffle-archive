<p>If you’re one of those fans who goes to concerts for the classics and makes a beer run during the new songs, don’t go to the first night of a tour.</p>
<p>Me, I try to always make opening night, because I love hearing new material–and since <a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2023/03/28/album-companion-wrecking-ball/"><em>Wrecking Ball</em> </a>is right up there near the very top of my favorite albums list, I was thrilled to be at the kick-off for the tour.</p>
<p>Sure, the show was short by Springsteen standards (the shows always grow as the tour progresses); there weren’t any audibles (early s<span class="text_exposed_show">hows tend to hew pretty closely to the setlist). But it was a real treat to hear so much of the album live, since new material typically gets swapped out for old once the album drops off the charts.</span></p>
<p>I’d managed to ignore the Apollo preview show so I wouldn’t have any spoilers, and I’m glad I did–the show was an emotional journey from start to finish. This was the first public E Street Band concert without Clarence Clemons, and no one know–least of all Bruce–how the crowd would react to his absence, and to the torch being gently passed onward.</p>
<p>Bruce gave himself a third-person introduction (that would be one of the first things to drop) before launching into “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/12/25/roll-of-the-dice-we-take-care-of-our-own/">We Take Care of Our Own,</a>” which became an instant favorite concert anthem. “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/08/12/roll-of-the-dice-wrecking-ball/">Wrecking Ball</a>” had more resonance now than it did when I first heard at the tail end of the Working on a Dream tour–Clarence’s absence loomed large. And even larger during “My City of Ruins,” where the audience had a chance to momentarily grieve before Bruce firmly re-established the Big Man’s spiritual presence.</p>

<p>One of the short-lived gems from this show: the premiere of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/06/10/roll-of-the-dice-easy-money/">Easy Money</a>” a foot-stomping companion piece to “<a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/06/04/roll-of-the-dice-atlantic-city/">Atlantic City</a>.” Another was the <a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/11/20/cover-me-the-way-you-do-the-things-you-do/">Apollo Medley</a>–a delightful surprise holdover from the preview show. I loved the new material, particularly “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/07/16/roll-of-the-dice-shackled-and-drawn/">Shackled and Drawn</a>,” “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2023/03/20/roll-of-the-dice-rocky-ground/">Rocky Ground</a>,” and “<a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/09/15/roll-of-the-dice-we-are-alive/">We Are Alive</a>.” By the end of the tour, “Shackled and Drawn” would lodge itself firmly near the top of my favorite songs to see Bruce perform live.</p>

<p>And Jake… Jake was a sensation from the start. Tentative at first (who wouldn’t be in his shoes), nestled in the comfort of a full horn section, it didn’t take long for Bruce to bring Jake out front, and Jake made the most of it, winning over the crowd thunderously.</p>
<p>It was a heck of an opener–and the show would only grow in size and power from here. The super-sized E Street Band was back–and even the loss of Clarence couldn’t diminish their magic.</p>
