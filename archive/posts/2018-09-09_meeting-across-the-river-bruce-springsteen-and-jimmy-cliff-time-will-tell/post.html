<p>But “Time Will Tell” is on the obscure side.</p>
<p>The lead-off track on Cliff’s self-titled 1969 album, “Time Will Tell” was never released as a single. It’s easy to see why it would appeal to Bruce, however, and why he’d choose to cover it in 1993: with its reflective, uncertain lyrics offset by an optimistic melody and vocal delivery, it seems a natural fit for what Bruce was singing and writing about at the time.</p>

<p>Perhaps that’s why Bruce included it in the set when he had the chance to have Jimmy join him on stage during his 1993 show in Verona. Or maybe Jimmy was the one who suggested it. Either way, it was a one-time-only event, at least until Bruce and Jimmy reprised it together at SxSW in 2012.</p>
