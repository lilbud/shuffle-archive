Bruce released an album of his own that year, and for the life of me, I cannot figure out why he didn&#8217;t add &#8220;Looking For Elvis&#8221; to his tour set lists instead of &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/08/09/matr-patti-scialfa-and-bruce-springsteen-town-called-heartbreak/\">Town Called Heartbreak</a>&#8221; (the first single from Patti&#8217;s album).</p>\n<p>Both are great songs, but &#8220;Looking For Elvis&#8221; fit the Magic Tour&#8217;s theme far better than the relationship-centric &#8220;Town Called Heartbreak,&#8221; plus Bruce already had the bullet mic on stage for his nightly performance of &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/02/27/roll-of-the-dice-reason-to-believe/\">Reason to Believe</a>.&#8221; (That&#8217;s Bruce, of course, playing harmonica and breathing heavy on the studio track.)</p>\n<p>Now, if you listened to Bruce&#8217;s radio show last summer you might have caught him and Patti discussing &#8220;Looking For Elvis&#8221; in Episode 9&#8211;and Bruce made a curious recollection:</p>\n<div id=\"v-8pX05LTC-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='568' src='https://videopress.com/embed/8pX05LTC?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>Bruce was wrong, though. They didn&#8217;t cut the track at Convention Hall. But as Patti correctly recalled, they <em>did</em> perform it live there (on a closed set) for an Elvis documentary called <em>Viva Las Vegas</em> (which you can find on DVD if you&#8217;re so inclined).</p>\n<p>And that live performance is very worth watching&#8211;it&#8217;s even stronger than the studio track. Bruce whoops up a storm in his extended solo, and Patti&#8217;s vocals are so angry that she uncharacteristically growls at times. Capping off with a &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/05/21/cover-me-mystery-train/\">Mystery Train</a>&#8221; tag, this is an outstanding performance that deserves more views
