<blockquote><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">“To me, Elvis was a metaphor for your more patriotic ideas and dreams for your country… and the guys, everybody, you and everybody, played the hell out of it.

<p>“Looking For Elvis” is more than just one of Patti Scialfa’s angriest songs; it’s also one of her best.</p>

<p>Patti doesn’t verge into the civic arena with her songwriting very often, but with “Looking For Elvis” she proved that she can write political songs when she wants to.</p>
<p>I’m always struck by the middle verse in particular–there’s an economy of language paired with powerful metaphor that just blows me away every time I hear it.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>I remember</em><br/>
<em>All those Septembers</em><br/>
<em>The pledges of allegiance</em><br/>
<em>The prayers of trust</em><br/>
<em>I slept on those beds of hope and promise</em><br/>
<em>Woke up choking on cheap paint and carnival dust</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>So where are you now</em><br/>
<em>With all those illusions</em><br/>
<em>Fallen dreams and charity</em><br/>
<em>If faith restores you</em><br/>
<em>And truth delivers</em><br/>
<em>Then don’t tell me that I’m standing</em><br/>
<em>When I’m on my knees</em></p>
<p>Patti released “Looking For Elvis” as the lead-off track for her 2007 album, <em>Play It As It Lays</em>. Bruce released an album of his own that year, and for the life of me, I cannot figure out why he didn’t add “Looking For Elvis” to his tour set lists instead of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/08/09/matr-patti-scialfa-and-bruce-springsteen-town-called-heartbreak/">Town Called Heartbreak</a>” (the first single from Patti’s album).</p>
<p>Both are great songs, but “Looking For Elvis” fit the Magic Tour’s theme far better than the relationship-centric “Town Called Heartbreak,” plus Bruce already had the bullet mic on stage for his nightly performance of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/02/27/roll-of-the-dice-reason-to-believe/">Reason to Believe</a>.” (That’s Bruce, of course, playing harmonica and breathing heavy on the studio track.)</p>
<p>Now, if you listened to Bruce’s radio show last summer you might have caught him and Patti discussing “Looking For Elvis” in Episode 9–and Bruce made a curious recollection:</p>
<div class="video-player" id="v-8pX05LTC-1"><iframe allow="clipboard-write" allowfullscreen="" aria-label="VideoPress Video Player" data-resize-to-parent="true" frameborder="0" height="568" src="https://videopress.com/embed/8pX05LTC" title="VideoPress Video Player" width="758"></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost="ignore" src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js"></script></div>
<p>Bruce was wrong, though. They didn’t cut the track at Convention Hall. But as Patti correctly recalled, they <em>did</em> perform it live there (on a closed set) for an Elvis documentary called <em>Viva Las Vegas</em> (which you can find on DVD if you’re so inclined).</p>
<p>And that live performance is very worth watching–it’s even stronger than the studio track. Bruce whoops up a storm in his extended solo, and Patti’s vocals are so angry that she uncharacteristically growls at times. Capping off with a “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/05/21/cover-me-mystery-train/">Mystery Train</a>” tag, this is an outstanding performance that deserves more views than it’s received.</p>
