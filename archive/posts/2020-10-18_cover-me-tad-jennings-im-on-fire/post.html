<p>I know, I know… another “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/09/11/roll-of-the-dice-im-on-fire/">I’m on Fire</a>” cover.</p>
<p>Trust me: at this point an artist needs to bring something new and fresh to the table if they want me to pay attention to the umpteenth cover of Bruce’s 1985 Top Ten single.</p>
<p>Tad Jennings does that.</p>
<p>Tad is a singer-songwriter and one-man band out of Daytona Beach,  and he knows the basic  rule for covers of classic songs: do it different or do it better. His <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaR4DUoX5d44P-gtg7k3NNA">YouTube channel</a> has several inventive covers worth checking out, and the other day he added a new one to the list: a one-take loop cover of “I’m on Fire.”</p>
<p>A great singer, a talented guitarist, and a mean multi-tasker, Tad delivers a performance worthy of a listen even if you think you’ve heard it all.</p>
