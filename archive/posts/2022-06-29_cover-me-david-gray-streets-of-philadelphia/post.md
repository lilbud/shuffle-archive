Singer-songwriter David Gray stopped by the BBC Radio 2 studio recently to celebrate the 20th anniversary of his album.

Gray played a few songs from his milestone album live on the air, and he added a special cover as well: Bruce’s award-winning “.” It’s a quiet performance that feels unplanned, and it was captured in terrific quality by the studio crew.

That album actually featured two covers of Bruce’s songs. We’ll take a listen to the other one sometime soon.
