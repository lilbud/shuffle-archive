<p>Buried deep on Jeffreys’ 1981 album <em>Escape Artist </em>(produced by Bob Clearmountain and featuring Danny Federici’s keyboards as well as Roy’s piano), “R.O.C.K.” is an irresistible anthem that demands to be played at full volume.</p>
<p>Still, despite Bruce’s many stage appearances with Garland Jeffreys over the years (eighteen as of this writing), Bruce and Garland only once tackled what should have been a natural team-up.</p>
<p>Or to be more accurate, they played it three times, once nightly during Bruce’s three-night holiday show stand in December 2003, when Bruce invited Garland to “lift up” the show.</p>
<p>Here’s a wonderful clip from the second night, with Garland and Bruce backed by The Max Weinberg 7.</p>

<p>Bruce and Garland certainly lifted the show, and you can clearly sense their mutual esteem and affection.</p>
