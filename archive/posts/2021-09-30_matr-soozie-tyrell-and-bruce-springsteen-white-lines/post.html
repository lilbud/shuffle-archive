<p>Released in 2003, <em>White Lines </em>highlights not just Soozie’s musicianship–we already knew about that–but also her powerful songwriting. Drawn from her own life experiences, Soozie’s songs range from contemplative to declarative but all anchored by her finally-out-in-front vocals and trademark violin.</p>
<p>The album leads off with its title track, one of two songs on the album to feature a Springsteen contribution. (See “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/08/21/meeting-across-the-river-soozie-tyrell-bruce-springsteen-and-patti-scialfa-ste-genevieve/">Ste. Genevieve</a>” for the other.)</p>

<p>It’s easy to see why this song in particular might have attracted Bruce: with its road metaphor and childhood reminiscences, it’s tailor-made for him.</p>
<p>Bruce’s lead guitar is present throughout but never so prominent in the mix that he distracts. You’ll notice him the most in between the verses as he carries us forward in years to the next chapter of the narrator’s story.</p>
