This is one of my all-time favorite covers of a Springsteen song. Even if you find yourself dismissing 95% of the cover attempts out there, take a few minutes to listen to this one. Not only is it a wonderful, spontaneous performance, but it’s gorgeously captured at one my absolute favorite outdoor venue.

In 2013, Elvis Costello and Mumford & Sons were both headliners at the Sasquatch Festival at the Gorge Amphitheater in Washington State. At some point over the course of the weekend, The One Campaign (co-founded by Bono to fight poverty and disease) convinced Elvis and Mumford & Sons to step away and record a performance to help the campaign raise awareness.

The musicians chose Bruce’s “,” with a bit of Woody Guthrie’s “Do Re Mi” in the middle.

Mumford takes lead vocals on Bruce’s song; Elvis takes point on Guthrie’s. And when they resume “Tom Joad” and the harmonies kick in, it’s magic.
