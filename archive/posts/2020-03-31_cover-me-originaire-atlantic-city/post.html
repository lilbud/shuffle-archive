<p>It seems like North Jersey gets all the glory whenever anyone talks about the Jersey Shore music scene, but South Jersey has its contenders as well–and one of the best bands to come out of South Jersey in some time is acoustic folk trio Originaire.</p>
<p>Originaire is based out of Atlantic City and features Ken Shiles and CiBon plus Philadelphia violinist Valerie Vuolo. Their original material is beautiful, but they pull off some terrific covers as well.</p>
<p>And maybe I’m biased, but I think their latest may be my favorite.</p>
<p>Set against their eerily deserted hometown in the midst of the great pandemic of 2020, here’s Originaire’s haunting take on Bruce Springsteen’s “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/06/04/roll-of-the-dice-atlantic-city/">Atlantic City.</a>”</p>

<p>Thank you, Originaire, for bringing us great music during our global quarantine.</p>
<p>I’ll be checking out their live shows when it’s safe to get back out there; in the meantime, you can join me at Originaire’s virtual happy hours–see their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/originairemusic/">Facebook page</a> for the next one.</p>
