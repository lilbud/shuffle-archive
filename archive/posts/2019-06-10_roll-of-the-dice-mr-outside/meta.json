Here&#8217;s that original recording from late 1979:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Mr Outside Bruce Springsteen\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/O6pWlMrDVww?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Like many of Bruce&#8217;s home demos, though, &#8220;Mr. Outside&#8221; was pretty raw. It included starts, stops, and mistakes as Bruce worked out the song.</p>\n<p>Undaunted, Scott carefully edited the song to remove the blemishes, paring away a full third of the recording. The result: the &#8220;official&#8221; version of &#8220;Mr. Outside&#8221; from\u00a0<em>The Ties That Bind: The River Collection</em>.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Mr. Outside (Studio Outtake - 1980)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PLa8TaCNM28?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Exactly\u00a0<em>why</em> Bruce and Toby went to the trouble, though, is a mystery.</p>\n<p>Musically, &#8220;Mr. Outside&#8221; is just one of a trilogy of never-finished songs that share the same melody, and the only one that ever saw any kind of official release. (See &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/04/19/roll-of-the-dice-whitetown/\">Whitetown</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/02/23/roll-of-the-dice-you-gotta-be-kind/\">You Gotta Be Kind</a>&#8221; for Mr. Outside&#8217;s siblings.) It probably works best for &#8220;Mr. Outside&#8221; though: the devil-may-care melody perfectly underscores Bruce&#8217;s lyrics.</p>\n<p>About those lyrics: it seems as if Bruce was reaching for a &#8220;Nowhere Man.&#8221; Written and recorded in 1979, Bruce&#8217;s titular character seems to foretell the stereotype that would come to define the coming decade:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>They call him Mr. Outside &#8217;cause he don&#8217;t care</em><br />\n<em>Mr. Outside, he&#8217;s just having his fun</em><br />\n<em>Mr. Outside, he&#8217;s just looking out for number one</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well Mr. Outside, oh your money and your power</em><br />\n<em>Won&#8217;t help you come the dark hour</em><br />\n<em>Kingdoms crumble to your feet</em><br />\n<em>You&#8217;re left another thief out on the street</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Dark glasses and money for hire</em><br />\n<em>All the riches and high-tension wire</em><br />\n<em>He got long dark, dark Cadillac</em><br />\n<em>He got pretty little little girl in back</em></p>\n<p>Nothing really happens in &#8220;Mr. Outside.&#8221; Essentially, the song is just a character sketch, and the excised verse from the bootleg version reveals the Bruce may have intended Mr. Outside to be even less sympathetic than the previous verses paint him.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Little baby got no diamond rings</em><br />\n<em>You cry &#8217;cause you ain&#8217;t got no pretty things</em><br />\n<em>Them pretty things, babe, just look dumb</em><br />\n<em>When you gotta take &#8217;em when they come</em></p>\n<p>None of the lyrics are particularly artful or insightful, and other than the early hints of songs yet to come (&#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/07/23/roll-of-the-dice-cadillac-ranch/\">Cadillac Ranch</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/03/29/roll-of-the-dice-take-em-as-they-come/\">Take &#8216;Em When They Come</a>&#8220;), there&#8217;s not a lot of interest here.</p>\n<p>Since it technically counts as an official release, I&#8217;m tempted to rank it dead last in Bruce&#8217;s catalog. But that hardly seems fair for a song that seems like it was released more for historical purposes than for artistic reasons.</p>\n<p>So I&#8217;ll give Mr. Outside a pass. As has Bruce: he&#8217;s never once performed it or mentioned it.</p>\n<p><strong>Mr. Outside</strong><br />\n<strong>Recorded:</strong> Late 1979<br />\n<strong>Released:</strong>\u00a0<em>The Ties That Bind: The River Collection</em><br />\n<strong>Never performed</strong></p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
