<p>When Bruce compiled a group of contemporary outtakes to include in his <em>The Ties That Bind: The River Collection </em>box set, he wanted to include “Mr. Outside.” Unfortunately, though, archivist Toby Scott couldn’t locate an “official” recording.</p>
<p>So Scott did exactly what you and I would have done: he scoured the Internet for a bootleg copy of Bruce’s original home demo, and found one. Here’s that original recording from late 1979:</p>

<p>Like many of Bruce’s home demos, though, “Mr. Outside” was pretty raw. It included starts, stops, and mistakes as Bruce worked out the song.</p>
<p>Undaunted, Scott carefully edited the song to remove the blemishes, paring away a full third of the recording. The result: the “official” version of “Mr. Outside” from <em>The Ties That Bind: The River Collection</em>.</p>

<p>Exactly <em>why</em> Bruce and Toby went to the trouble, though, is a mystery.</p>
<p>Musically, “Mr. Outside” is just one of a trilogy of never-finished songs that share the same melody, and the only one that ever saw any kind of official release. (See “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/04/19/roll-of-the-dice-whitetown/">Whitetown</a>” and “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/02/23/roll-of-the-dice-you-gotta-be-kind/">You Gotta Be Kind</a>” for Mr. Outside’s siblings.) It probably works best for “Mr. Outside” though: the devil-may-care melody perfectly underscores Bruce’s lyrics.</p>
<p>About those lyrics: it seems as if Bruce was reaching for a “Nowhere Man.” Written and recorded in 1979, Bruce’s titular character seems to foretell the stereotype that would come to define the coming decade:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>They call him Mr. Outside ’cause he don’t care</em><br/>
<em>Mr. Outside, he’s just having his fun</em><br/>
<em>Mr. Outside, he’s just looking out for number one</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Well Mr. Outside, oh your money and your power</em><br/>
<em>Won’t help you come the dark hour</em><br/>
<em>Kingdoms crumble to your feet</em><br/>
<em>You’re left another thief out on the street</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Dark glasses and money for hire</em><br/>
<em>All the riches and high-tension wire</em><br/>
<em>He got long dark, dark Cadillac</em><br/>
<em>He got pretty little little girl in back</em></p>
<p>Nothing really happens in “Mr. Outside.” Essentially, the song is just a character sketch, and the excised verse from the bootleg version reveals the Bruce may have intended Mr. Outside to be even less sympathetic than the previous verses paint him.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Little baby got no diamond rings</em><br/>
<em>You cry ’cause you ain’t got no pretty things</em><br/>
<em>Them pretty things, babe, just look dumb</em><br/>
<em>When you gotta take ’em when they come</em></p>
<p>None of the lyrics are particularly artful or insightful, and other than the early hints of songs yet to come (“<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/07/23/roll-of-the-dice-cadillac-ranch/">Cadillac Ranch</a>” and “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/03/29/roll-of-the-dice-take-em-as-they-come/">Take ‘Em When They Come</a>“), there’s not a lot of interest here.</p>
<p>Since it technically counts as an official release, I’m tempted to rank it dead last in Bruce’s catalog. But that hardly seems fair for a song that seems like it was released more for historical purposes than for artistic reasons.</p>
<p>So I’ll give Mr. Outside a pass. As has Bruce: he’s never once performed it or mentioned it.</p>
