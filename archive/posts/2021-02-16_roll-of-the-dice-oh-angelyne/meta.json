As the economy declined, employers began shedding jobs, starting with the individuals who needed them most.</p>\n<p>Michael &#8220;Mickey&#8221; Shave was one of the earliest affected by the economic downturn. Mickey was a construction worker with a wife and two children to provide for, and the loss of his job hit his family hard.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not as if the Shaves were unaccustomed to life&#8217;s challenges, though&#8211;they were sailing into the wind from the start, in fact, marrying when young Virginia became pregnant during her senior year of high school, at the age of seventeen.</p>\n<p>Still, they&#8217;d done the right things, the things they were taught to do: get married, settle down, get a job, work hard, and raise a family. In America, if you did those things well, you&#8217;d be taken care of.</p>\n<p>That all started to change in 1979, though, and America never looked back.</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t worry&#8211;the story has a happy ending, at least for the Shaves. Mickey and Ginny are still happily married and those early days are likely a distant memory. But not everyone&#8217;s story worked out that way, and there was no way to know at the time which way the Mickey and Ginny&#8217;s story would go.</p>\n<p>That troubled Ginny&#8217;s big brother, a rock-and-roll singer-songwriter of some renown. It troubled him enough to write a song about it, in fact. He started working on it during the first half of 1979, writing a story so explicitly true that it would shock Ginny when she eventually heard him perform it for the first time in a sold-out arena. Bruce changed the name of his heroine, though, to provide his sister a semblance of privacy. Instead of Ginny, Bruce named his character Mary, a name he was particularly fond of.</p>\n<p>In its early incarnations, the characters and backdrop might have been ripped from reality, but the plot wasn&#8217;t. Although Bruce&#8217;s unnamed narrator and his girl Mary paralleled the early days of Mickey and Ginny, Bruce&#8217;s narrator was so unhappy in his marriage that he pined for another woman, a temptress named Angelyne.</p>\n<p>His yearning to escape the girl he&#8217;d been saddled with and run off with his fantasy girl consumed him, and in his mind the narrator was always running, running to Angelyne. In this early outtake, in fact, Mary isn&#8217;t even mentioned.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen Angelyne #4 Acoustic Demo\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8eKuVgBuNI0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I come from down in the valley where mister straight from day number one</em><br />\n<em>They bring you up to do what your daddy done</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;m working for the Jenkins Company, but there ain&#8217;t work on account of the economy</em><br />\n<em>???,\u00a0 don&#8217;t need men to put &#8217;em up</em><br />\n<em>Not by me, not by anyone</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Oh Angelyne, I&#8217;m running to you, I&#8217;m running to you</em><br />\n<em>Angelyne, you run on the wire, you walk the line</em></p>\n<p>We meet Mary in this next demo, and this is where it becomes clear that our narrator longs to escape the life he&#8217;s made for himself.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen Angelyne #1 Acoustic Demo\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/APldzhXlBIE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well mister when you&#8217;re young</em><br />\n<em>They bring you up to do, yeah, what your daddy done</em><br />\n<em>I worked construction with the Jenkins company</em><br />\n<em>Lately there ain&#8217;t been much work on account of the economy</em><br />\n<em>Man don&#8217;t need no buildings, don&#8217;t need men to build a home</em><br />\n<em>Well a man don&#8217;t need me, goodbye me</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Oh Angelyne, I&#8217;m running to you, I&#8217;m running to you</em><br />\n<em>Oh Angelyne, when you&#8217;re on the wire you walk the line</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I met Mary at ???

He longs to escape to/with Angelyne, although Bruce\u00a0 never reveals whether his character runs off with her in real life or just in his mind.</p>\n<p>Bruce worked on &#8220;Oh Angelyne&#8221; throughout the first half of 1979, crafting and shaping it but never completely satisfied with it. Two years later, he would tell an interviewer, &#8220;[it] took a while. I had the verses, I never had any chorus, and I didn&#8217;t have no title for a long time&#8230;. I had these verses, and I was fooling around with the music.&#8221;</p>\n<p>(We can tell from the outtakes that Bruce did indeed have a chorus, but Bruce has always been so prolific a songwriter that his memory can sometimes be unreliable during later interviews.)</p>\n<p>But then inspiration hit. On tour the previous summer, Bruce had become fascinated to the point of obsession with the music of Hank Williams. In interviews ever after, he would refer to his original inspiration as Hank&#8217;s &#8220;My Bucket&#8217;s Got a Hole In It,&#8221; but it&#8217;s hard to believe he wasn&#8217;t at least subsequently and substantially inspired by another of Williams&#8217; songs, &#8220;Long Gone Lonesome Blues.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Long Gone Lonesome Blues\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/esIK2-XvHM4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>In particular, there&#8217;s a striking familiarity in that song&#8217;s first verse&#8230;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I went down to the river to watch the fish swim by</em><br />\n<em>But I got to the river so lonesome I wanted to die</em><br />\n<em>And then I jumped in the river, but the doggone river was dry</em></p>\n<p>Regardless of which Hank Williams song we credit, Bruce realized what his own song was missing. By late August, he&#8217;d transformed &#8220;Oh Angelyne,&#8221; keeping its central couple and circumstance, but ditching the other woman and replacing her with a metaphor borrowed from Williams.</p>\n<p>(Bruce took pity on Angelyne, though, and introduced her to his friend Gary. <a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/02/04/cover-me-gary-u-s-bonds-and-the-e-street-band-angelyne/\">They clicked</a>.)</p>\n<p>Now his song was complete and ready for the recording studio. Bruce&#8217;s retitled, transformed &#8220;Oh Angelyne&#8221; would become an instant classic and endure to this day as one of his greatest recordings and songwriting accomplishments.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll take a deep listen to that song and admire it in detail&#8230; soon.</p>\n<p>(To be continued in\u00a0<em>Roll of the Dice:\u00a0</em>&#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/03/04/roll-of-the-dice-the-river/\">The River</a>&#8220;)</p>\n<p><strong>Oh Angelyne<br />\nRecorded:</strong> February-May 1979 (demos only)<br />\n<strong>Never released</strong><br />\n<strong>Never performed</strong></p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
