Slowed down so it can breathe, &#8220;Two Hearts&#8221; transforms into the tender promise of faith, friendship, and fidelity it was always meant to be.</p>\n<p>Every once in a while another artist hears that same tucked-away tenderness and tries an acoustic arrangement themselves, and I find myself falling in love with &#8220;Two Hearts&#8221; all over again.</p>\n<p>Like with today&#8217;s entry. You may remember Caryl Mack from the late 1990s, when she had a couple singles on the Billboard Country chart. She&#8217;s remained an accomplished, award-winning country singer-songwriter ever since, and recently she&#8217;s developed a fondness for the music of a New Jersey rock and roll icon.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A few years ago, I did a deep dive into the music of Bruce Springsteen,&#8221; she wrote on her Facebook page, &#8220;and discovered this little gem called &#8216;Two Hearts.&#8217; I love the message: We need each other.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Although she&#8217;d covered it solo during the early lockdown phase of the pandemic, a song called &#8220;Two Hearts&#8221; calls for some collaborators. So\u00a0 just recently, she assembled her Live from the Firepit band and turned in an absolutely gorgeous performance that&#8217;s on heavy rotation for me at the moment.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Two Hearts (Bruce Springsteen Cover) | Live From the Firepit | Caryl Mack\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uRYz1J4K8Fk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;Two Hearts&#8221; isn&#8217;t the only Springsteen song Mack has added to her repertoire.
