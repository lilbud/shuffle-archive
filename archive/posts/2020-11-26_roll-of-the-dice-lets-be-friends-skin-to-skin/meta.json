Even under the grayest of Seattle skies, &#8220;Let&#8217;s Be Friends&#8221; brings out the sun.</p>\n<p>I honestly can&#8217;t fathom the criticism that &#8220;Let&#8217;s Be Friends&#8221; attracts, although I will readily admit that it is <i>horribly\u00a0</i>out of place smack dab in the middle of <em>The Rising.\u00a0</em>Seriously, Bruce? You&#8217;re such a perfectionist when you sequence and structure your albums, and you thought it was a good idea to include &#8220;Let&#8217;s Be Friends?&#8221; Yeah, &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/07/04/roll-of-the-dice-the-fuse/\">The Fuse</a>&#8221; covers similar ground, but it&#8217;s set against a stark backdrop; and &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/09/27/roll-of-the-dice-waitin-on-a-sunny-day/\">Waitin&#8217; on a Sunny Day</a>&#8221; may be light pop, but it&#8217;s rooted in sadness. &#8220;Let&#8217;s Be Friends&#8221; is just flat-out inappropriate for that album, IMO. Shoulda saved it for <em>Working on a Dream.</em></p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re hoping (like me) to catch this song live, don&#8217;t hold your breath. Bruce has played it only once, at the tail end of The Rising Tour, and it was, um, rough:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - LET&#039;S BE FRIENDS (SKIN TO SKIN) 2003 live\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wawtqYSdCPM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Yeah, maybe this one is better kept to vinyl.
