<p>Here’s another cover I like better than the original.</p>
<p>Willie Nelson and Emmylou Harris infuse “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/10/16/roll-of-the-dice-dry-lightning/">Dry Lightning</a>‘ with more authentic world-weariness than Bruce manages to convey on his own, and the mariachi melody that’s understated in the original is prominent in this cover–transporting us immediately to the border where this song is set.</p>
