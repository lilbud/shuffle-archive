<p>Tessa Murray’s vocals are well-suited for Bruce’s dream-like lyrics, but she otherwise turns in a performance that’s more wistful than sinister or sensual–and that’s not a bad thing, just a different thing.</p>
<p>Take a listen to this worthy addition to the thick catalog of “I’m on Fire” covers.</p>
