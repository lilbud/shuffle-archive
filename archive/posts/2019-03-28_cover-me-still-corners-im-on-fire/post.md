Mere weeks after the release of their very first album, London-based duo Still Corners made an appearance at our local radio station KEXP here in Seattle, where they played a four-song set in the studio that wrapped with an ethereal cover of Bruce's "[I'm on Fire](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/09/11/roll-of-the-dice-im-on-fire/)."

Tessa Murray's vocals are well-suited for Bruce's dream-like lyrics, but she otherwise turns in a performance that's more wistful than sinister or sensual–and that's not a bad thing, just a different thing.

Take a listen to this worthy addition to the thick catalog of "I'm on Fire" covers.
