<p>But a full-band acoustic cover that’s just as joyous and rocking as a full-on electric version? That’s new.</p>
<p>But that’s what Prescott, Arizona-based Sugar and The Mint gives us with their delightful cover of Bruce’s signature song from their 2018 album, <em>Just Past Midnight</em>.</p>

<p>With roots in folk and bluegrass and branches in pop, rock, and country, this string quintet covers a remarkable range on their albums and on stage, and their joy and love for the source material is palpable.</p>
<p>Just watch their live performance from a few years ago and try not to smile. Oh and in case you’ve ever wondered whether that iconic sax solo would work just as perfectly on the violin:</p>
<p>Why, yes. Yes, it does.</p>
