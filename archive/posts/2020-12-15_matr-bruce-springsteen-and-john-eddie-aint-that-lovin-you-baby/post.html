<p>Elvis Presley recorded a cover of “Ain’t That Lovin’ You Baby” (dropping the comma for some maddening reason) in 1958 but locked it away in his vault for six years.</p>

<p>Elvis finally released it in late 1964, and his timing was perfect. “Ain’t That Lovin’ You Baby” wasn’t one of his most popular hits, but it climbed its way to #16 on the charts, and that was high enough to earn it a place in the hearts of Elvis fans like Bruce Springsteen.</p>
<p>Bruce first covered “Ain’t That Lovin’ You Baby” in the summer of 1983, during one of his many open secret performances with the Stone Pony house band, Cats on a Smooth Surface.</p>
<p>We’ve got a recording of that performance, but unfortunately it’s very distant and muddy.</p>

<p>Luckily, though, it seems that was only a warm-up performance, because five days later, Bruce played it again, this time with John Eddie at the Brighton Bar in Long Branch.</p>
<p>And this time, the recording quality is terrific. Here’s Bruce on lead vocals with John Eddie and The Front Street Runners, performing a great cover (his last to date) of “Ain’t That Lovin’ You Baby.”</p>
