<p>The Mavericks are certainly no stranger to Bruce’s catalog–<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/02/28/cover-me-the-mavericks-all-that-heaven-will-allow/">their cover of “All That Heaven Will Allow”</a> is one of the finer Springsteen covers out there.</p>
<p>Now they’re at it again: just a couple of months ago they released their latest album, an all-covers compilation entitled <em>Play the Hits</em>.</p>
<p>This time, the band turns their attention to “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/12/21/roll-of-the-dice-hungry-heart/">Hungry Heart</a>,” giving it an infectious country-ska treatment. (I don’t know if that’s a thing, but it sure sounds like it to me.)</p>

<p>It’s not surprising to see the band lavishing love an attention on Bruce’s songs–they’re clearly big fans. And don’t just take that from me:</p>

<p>Let’s hope their wish comes true and Bruce joins them on stage sometime soon. I’d love to see how Bruce would take to an arrangement like this one.</p>
