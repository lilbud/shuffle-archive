The Mavericks are certainly no stranger to Bruce's catalog–[their cover of "All That Heaven Will Allow"](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/02/28/cover-me-the-mavericks-all-that-heaven-will-allow/) is one of the finer Springsteen covers out there.

Now they're at it again: just a couple of months ago they released their latest album, an all-covers compilation entitled *Play the Hits*.

This time, the band turns their attention to "[Hungry Heart](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/12/21/roll-of-the-dice-hungry-heart/)," giving it an infectious country-ska treatment. (I don't know if that's a thing, but it sure sounds like it to me.)

It's not surprising to see the band lavishing love an attention on Bruce's songs–they're clearly big fans. And don't just take that from me:

Let's hope their wish comes true and Bruce joins them on stage sometime soon. I'd love to see how Bruce would take to an arrangement like this one.
