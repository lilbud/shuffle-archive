One of my all-time favorite Bruce covers: “[Don’t Look Back](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/05/03/roll-of-the-dice-dont-look-back/)” by The Knack. (I’m a child of the 1980s. No apologies.)

If you’re gonna cover a Bruce Springsteen song, you either need to reinvent it or completely commit to it. These guys did the latter–and they wisely chose a song so well suited to their style that you could be forgiven for assuming it was their own material.
