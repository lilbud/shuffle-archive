<p>One of my all-time favorite Bruce covers: “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/05/03/roll-of-the-dice-dont-look-back/">Don’t Look Back</a>” by The Knack.  (I’m a child of the 1980s. No apologies.)</p>
<p>If you’re gonna cover a Bruce Springsteen song, you either need to reinvent it or completely commit to it. These guys did the latter–and they wisely chose a song so well suited to their style that you could be forgiven for assuming it was their own material.</p>
