<p>Some team-ups are too good to be one-offs.</p>
<p>In 2020, Patti Scialfa and Bruce Springsteen lent their talents to Dion for a new arrangement of Dion’s “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/04/26/matr-dion-bruce-springsteen-and-patti-scialfa-hymn-to-him/">Hymn to Him</a>” paean on his <em>Blues With Friends </em>album, with Patti arranging and providing beautiful background vocals and Bruce contributing a guitar solo.</p>
<p>“Hymn to Him” turned out so nicely that the three reunited for Dion’s follow-up album, <em>Stomping Ground, </em>in 2021.</p>
<p>“Angel in the Alleyways” is another religious-themed track, and once again Patti arranged her vocals for it. This time there’s a video for the song as well, set primarily at <span class="blast mmt-sentence">the Monastery of St.</span> <span class="blast mmt-sentence">Bernard de Clairvaux in Miami but with interwoven clips of Patti and Bruce (on harmonica when he’s on screen, although he’s credited on guitar as well) in their home studio.</span></p>

<p><span class="blast mmt-sentence">In the album’s liner notes, Dion wrote: “I gave Patti a simple, raw demo of ‘Angel in the Alleyways,’ with just my guitar and vocal.</span> <span class="blast mmt-sentence">What you’ll hear now is what Patti made of it.</span> <span class="blast mmt-sentence">There are five verses, and she treated each of them in a unique way.</span> <span class="blast mmt-sentence">This is her gift.</span> <span class="blast mmt-sentence">The lady’s imagination is unlimited.</span> <span class="blast mmt-sentence">Her husband contributed the right tones on guitar and harmonica.</span> <span class="blast mmt-sentence">They are my dream team.</span> <span class="blast mmt-sentence">They truly make me feel loved.”</span></p>
