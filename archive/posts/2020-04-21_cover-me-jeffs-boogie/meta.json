The Castiles were in their third year as a band, and Bruce was already garnering a reputation as a hot-shot guitar player. So <em>of course</em> he was going to take a run at &#8220;Jeff&#8217;s Boogie.&#8221;</p>\n<p>How did he do? Listen for yourself:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen and The Castiles: Jeff&#039;s Boogie 1967 09 16, The Left Foot Club, Freehold, NJ\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tz-S0u5YlNg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Maybe Jeff Beck didn&#8217;t need to sweat the competition at the moment, but for a teenager fronting a high school band, that was pretty good.</p>\n<p>Bruce would try &#8220;Jeff&#8217;s Boogie&#8221; again on at least one other occasion in 1971, but no recording from that performance circulates. By that point, though, Bruce had more than proven himself as an accomplished guitarist and was focusing on his original material.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Jeff&#8217;s Boogie&#8221; is probably a lot more challenging for 71-year-old fingers than it is for 17-year-old ones, so odds are awfully long against us hearing Bruce try it ever again.</p>\n<p>But thankfully we have that 1967 recording of an aspiring rock star full of spit and fire and nothing at all to fear.</p>\n<p><strong>Jeff&#8217;s Boogie<br />\nFirst performed:</strong> September 16, 1967 (Freehold, NJ)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> November 23, 1971 (Linden, NJ)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>One time only: Jeff Beck&#8217;s &#8220;Jeff Boogie&#8221; intimidates even the most accomplished guitar players, but Bruce Springsteen took a shot at it on stage at the tender age of seventeen.
