<p>I wrote about “<a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/01/13/roll-of-the-dice-you-mean-so-much-to-me/">You Mean So Much to Me</a>” last month, tracing its evolution from a brassy Bruce Springsteen Band jam to a cool, jazzy showcase for the E Street keyboardists.</p>
<p>But the story doesn’t end there.</p>
<p>Although Bruce ditched “You Mean So Much to Me” part way through the Wild and Innocent Tour and never looked back, Bruce’s orphaned song found a new family.</p>
<p>When Bruce realized he wasn’t going to find a place for “You Mean So Much to Me,” and when Southside Johnny landed a record deal of his own, Bruce gifted his good friend with the song. Southside recorded it as a duet with Ronnie Spector with Steve Van Zandt producing, and the result was the definitive version of the song.</p>

<p>Or perhaps I should’ve said: the definitive <em>studio</em> version, because Southside and Ronnie take the song to the next level in their live performance on Ronnie’s <em>Very Best of Ronnie Spector</em> album.</p>

<p>But there’s still one more page to the story.</p>
<p>For two nights only in May of 1977, Ronnie Spector sang “You Mean So Much to Me” as a duet with the songwriter himself.</p>
<p>Originally billed as a Southside Johnny and The Asbury Jukes gig, Southside took sick and couldn’t perform. Steve Van Zandt rode to the rescue, creating an all-star revue called, well, The Asbury Park All-Star Revue, consisting of the Jukes, the E Street Band, Ronnie and Bruce.</p>
<p>The set list for each show (there were three across the two nights) consisted primarily of Southside songs, with a few Spector and Springsteen songs sprinkled in. But late in the encores came a special duet of a song Bruce hadn’t performed in more than three years and never would again.</p>
<p>Here’s one of those special performances, and the end of the line for Bruce’s custody of “You Mean So Much to Me.”</p>
