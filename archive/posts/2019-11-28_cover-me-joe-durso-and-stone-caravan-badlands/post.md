It takes guts to reinvent an anthem like “.” Even Bruce has never deviated from its original arrangement–it was pretty much born perfect.

But leave it to fellow Jersey boy Joe D’Urso to take a swing at it, and he certainly puts his own spin on it, giving it almost an island-flavored arrangement with a boost from Miami Horns members Richie LaBamba, Mark Pender, and Jerry Vivino.
