From their 2008 EP by the same name, here's a lovely acoustic cover of "[Brilliant Disguise](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/02/06/roll-of-the-dice-brilliant-disguise/)" by Canadian band, The Reason. Most of the song is brash and bright, but the band grows quieter as the song becomes more contemplative, to great effect. A very nice cover of one of my all-time favorites.
