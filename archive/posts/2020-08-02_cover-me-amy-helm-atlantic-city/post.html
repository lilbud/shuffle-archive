<p>Amy Helm has been covering “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/06/04/roll-of-the-dice-atlantic-city/">Atlantic City</a>” for years–which isn’t surprising, considering how many times she must have heard her dad’s version of it while growing up.</p>
<p>Amy’s father, Levon, recorded one of the best and definitive Springsteen covers with The Band; their cover of “Atlantic City” was released on their 1993 album, <em>Jericho</em>.</p>

<p>When Amy struck out on her own as a solo artist in 2015, “Atlantic City” was in her set lists from the beginning. Here’s her terrific acoustic cover from her performance at New York’s City Winery in 2015.</p>

<p>Amy has continued including “Atlantic City” in her sets right up to the present. Here’s a harder-rocking performance from last year’s FreshGrass Festival.</p>

<p>As a vocal and enthusiastic fan of The Band, I have to imagine Bruce deeply appreciates being part of Levon’s legacy.</p>
<p>Acoustic or electric, Amy does both Bruce and Levon proud.</p>
