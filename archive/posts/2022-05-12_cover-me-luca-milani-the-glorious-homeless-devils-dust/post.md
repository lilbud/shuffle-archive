If “[Born in the U.S.A.](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/09/21/roll-of-the-dice-born-in-the-u-s-a/),” a protest song born of the blues, works as rock anthem, then why wouldn’t “[Devils & Dust](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/03/02/roll-of-the-dice-devils-dust/)“?

“I did a version like that myself in the studio… and it worked very well,” Bruce told Brian Hiatt in *Bruce Springsteen: The Stories Behind the Songs*.

Italian singer-songwriter Luca Milani saw the song’s potential as a straight-up rocker, too. Together with his band The Glorious Homeless, Milani worked up a full-band rock arrangement of “Devils & Dust” and recorded it for this year’s edition of Noi & Springsteen’s annual *Cover Me* contest devoted to creative re-imaginings of Bruce’s work.

It works spectacularly, preserving enough of the original arrangement to be instantly recognizable but adding urgency and dramatic emphasis that amplify the power of Bruce’s lyrics rather than obfuscate them. Take a look and listen for yourself:
