<p>If “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/09/21/roll-of-the-dice-born-in-the-u-s-a/">Born in the U.S.A.</a>,” a protest song born of the blues, works as rock anthem, then why wouldn’t “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/03/02/roll-of-the-dice-devils-dust/">Devils &amp; Dust</a>“?</p>
<p>“I did a version like that myself in the studio… and it worked very well,” Bruce told Brian Hiatt in <em>Bruce Springsteen: The Stories Behind the Songs</em>.</p>
<p>Italian singer-songwriter Luca Milani saw the song’s potential as a straight-up rocker, too. Together with his band The Glorious Homeless, Milani worked up a full-band rock arrangement of “Devils &amp; Dust” and recorded it for this year’s edition of Noi &amp; Springsteen’s annual <em>Cover Me</em> contest devoted to creative re-imaginings of Bruce’s work.</p>
<p>It works spectacularly, preserving enough of the original arrangement to be instantly recognizable but adding urgency and dramatic emphasis that amplify the power of Bruce’s lyrics rather than obfuscate them. Take a look and listen for yourself:</p>
