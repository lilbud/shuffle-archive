I’m not sure what to say about this cover of “[Girls in Their Summer Clothes](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/02/17/roll-of-the-dice-girls-in-their-summer-clothes/)” by Czech indie-pop band (and Eurovision 2019 finalists) Lake Malawi, other than they certainly follow this blog’s cardinal cover rule: Do it better, or do it different.

Which way did they go? Take a listen and decide for yourself:

After watching it a few times, I still can’t decide if I like it.

I mean, I *do* like it, but I can’t decide if it’s the band’s performance I dig or the *Muppet Show* flashbacks I get from the arrangement.

Either way, this made me happy enough to check out their original music, which turns out to be pretty catchy.
