<p>I’m not sure what to say about this cover of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/02/17/roll-of-the-dice-girls-in-their-summer-clothes/">Girls in Their Summer Clothes</a>” by Czech indie-pop band (and Eurovision 2019 finalists) Lake Malawi, other than they certainly follow this blog’s cardinal cover rule: Do it better, or do it different.</p>
<p>Which way did they go? Take a listen and decide for yourself:</p>

<p>After watching it a few times, I still can’t decide if I like it.</p>
<p>I mean, I <em>do</em> like it, but I can’t decide if it’s the band’s performance I dig or the <em>Muppet Show </em>flashbacks I get from the arrangement.</p>

<p>Either way, this made me happy enough to check out their original music, which turns out to be pretty catchy.</p>
