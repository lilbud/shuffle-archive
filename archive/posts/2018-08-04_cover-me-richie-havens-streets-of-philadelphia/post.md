In 1995, Rhino Records issued a thorough (and thoroughly great) five-disc box set called *Academy Award Winning Songs (1934-1993).*

Starting with Fred Astaire and including such luminaries as Bing Crosby, Judy Garland, Billie Holiday, Henry Mancini, and so many more, the box set traces a historical arc through American cinema, culminating, of course, with Bruce's "[Streets of Philadelphia,](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/06/30/roll-of-the-dice-streets-of-philadelphia/)" the Oscar winning song for 1993.

There was just one problem: Rhino couldn't get the rights to include Bruce's own version of the song. "Streets of Philadelphia" was too big of a hit to leave off the collection, though, so they decided to commission a cover instead.

As the last song of a 60-track compilation, that decision could have turned out disastrously if a lesser artist was chosen to perform it. But instead, they chose the late, great Richie Havens, who hit it out of the park.

Give a listen to Havens' soulful, mournful, achingly beautiful take of Bruce's "Streets of Philadelphia," from the Rhino box set (and later, on the *One Step Up/Two Steps Back* tribute album). It's as good or (dare I say it?) better than the original.
