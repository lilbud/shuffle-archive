<p>Starting with Fred Astaire and including such luminaries as Bing Crosby, Judy Garland, Billie Holiday, Henry Mancini, and so many more, the box set traces a historical arc through American cinema, culminating, of course, with Bruce’s “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/06/30/roll-of-the-dice-streets-of-philadelphia/">Streets of Philadelphia,</a>” the Oscar winning song for 1993.</p>
<p>There was just one problem: Rhino couldn’t get the rights to include Bruce’s own version of the song. “Streets of Philadelphia” was too big of a hit to leave off the collection, though, so they decided to commission a cover instead.</p>
<p>As the last song of a 60-track compilation, that decision could have turned out disastrously if a lesser artist was chosen to perform it. But instead, they chose the late, great Richie Havens, who hit it out of the park.</p>
<p>Give a listen to Havens’ soulful, mournful, achingly beautiful take of Bruce’s “Streets of Philadelphia,” from the Rhino box set (and later, on the <em>One Step Up/Two Steps Back</em> tribute album). It’s as good or (dare I say it?) better than the original.</p>
