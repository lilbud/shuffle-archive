Back in the days when songs could actually chart regionally, the song reached number one in the Philadelphia metropolitan area. It didn&#8217;t do too shabby nationally, either, peaking at #4.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Expressway to Your Heart&#8221; was local through and through: the band was formed when two vans collided on the New Jersey Turnpike&#8211;one with singers, the other with instrumentalists. Marvelling at their no-fatalities luck, the musicians got together, formed a band, and named themselves (fittingly) The Soul Survivors after the circumstances of their meeting.</p>\n<p>As for the song, it was practically literal: songwriter and local legend Kenny Gamble was stuck on the Schuylkill Expressway trying desperately to be on time for a date. To calm himself while in traffic, he wrote this song.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Expressway To Your Heart The Soul Survivors In Stereo by Tom Moulton original rotation StevenB\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4EBYMl-f-wo?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>With such deep-set Philly/Jersey roots, how could Bruce\u00a0<em>not</em> be a fan?</p>\n<p>The only surprising fact about Bruce&#8217;s cover of &#8220;Expressway to Your Heart&#8221; is that he only did it once&#8211;and only thanks to a sign request.
