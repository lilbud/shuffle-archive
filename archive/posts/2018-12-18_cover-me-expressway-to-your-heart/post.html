<p>Today’s spotlight cover holds a special place in the hearts of Philly boys like me.</p>
<p>If you grew up in Philly in the sixties or the seventies, The Soul Survivors’ “Expressway to Your Heart” was unavoidable. Back in the days when songs could actually chart regionally, the song reached number one in the Philadelphia metropolitan area. It didn’t do too shabby nationally, either, peaking at #4.</p>
<p>“Expressway to Your Heart” was local through and through: the band was formed when two vans collided on the New Jersey Turnpike–one with singers, the other with instrumentalists. Marvelling at their no-fatalities luck, the musicians got together, formed a band, and named themselves (fittingly) The Soul Survivors after the circumstances of their meeting.</p>
<p>As for the song, it was practically literal: songwriter and local legend Kenny Gamble was stuck on the Schuylkill Expressway trying desperately to be on time for a date. To calm himself while in traffic, he wrote this song.</p>

<p>With such deep-set Philly/Jersey roots, how could Bruce <em>not</em> be a fan?</p>
<p>The only surprising fact about Bruce’s cover of “Expressway to Your Heart” is that he only did it once–and only thanks to a sign request. But it’s a great performance.</p>
<p>From Nassau Coliseum on the Working on a Dream Tour, enjoy the E Street Band’s take of The Soul Survivors’ “Expressway to Your Heart.”</p>
