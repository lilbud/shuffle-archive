But Betty sure seems to stoke his fire. When we first meet the pair, Bobby&#8217;s about to drag race, and Betty is officiating:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Black Mellon Road on a dark mellow night</em><br />\n<em>Two cars pulling up ahead on my right</em><br />\n<em>Going up the highway, gonna see my Betty Jean</em><br />\n<em>She got eyes like a jack rabbit, staring dead at my beams</em></p>\n<p>Who won the race? Who knows. Doesn&#8217;t matter anyway, that&#8217;s not the point. We&#8217;re on to their next adventure out in the woods where Betty distractedly cheers Bobby on in a fistfight:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Well over in the woods in a hail door light</em><br />\n<em>Two Red Hills boys in a bare-knuckle fight</em><br />\n<em>Stretched out on the hood of my GTO</em><br />\n<em>She&#8217;s filing her nails, shouting, &#8220;Go Bobby, go!&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>Bobby sums Betty up pretty well:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Betty Jean, Betty Jean, Betty Jean</em><br />\n<em>Betty Jean, Betty Jean, Betty Jean</em><br />\n<em>Honey you&#8217;re cute, but you sure are mean</em><br />\n<em>Oh Betty Jean</em></p>\n<p>Bobby and Betty don&#8217;t slow down one bit. Bobby races up the highway while Betty gives him&#8230; well, use your imagination (there&#8217;s not a lot required):</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Well she jumped in my car, we started driving around</em><br />\n<em>She turned that radio dial, threw her head back and sound</em><br />\n<em>Going up the highway, she was giving me it</em><br />\n<em>She put her hand on my leg, I drove us in a drainage ditch</em></p>\n<p>You can&#8217;t run forever, though. Sooner or later, life catches up and reality sinks its talons into you. And Bobby learns the lesson of &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/03/04/roll-of-the-dice-the-river/\">The River</a>,&#8221; although it&#8217;s not clear they ever had the forethought to dream in the first place.</p>\n<p>Bruce gives the last verse of &#8220;Betty Jean&#8221; a final line just as memorable as the one in &#8220;The River,&#8221; but a lot less poetic:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Next thing I knew, I was running through the crowd</em><br />\n<em>I swore her my love forever, she was laughing out loud</em><br />\n<em>We were married in the spring out on 531</em><br />\n<em>Had fifteen kids and I hate every single one</em></p>\n<p>And there we have it: the tale of Betty Jean, who peaked early while her sibling Bobby Jean escaped with the wind at his back.</p>\n<p>A final curiosity about the Jeans: they actually have a\u00a0<em>third</em> sibling.</p>\n<p><em>Beverly</em> Jean made her debut in &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/08/28/roll-of-the-dice-delivery-man/\">Delivery Man,</a>&#8221; another unreleased song from the\u00a0<em>Born in the U.S.A.
