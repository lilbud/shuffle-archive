<p>No, that’s not a typo in the title: this is the story of <em>Betty</em> Jean.</p>
<p>We all know <a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/06/19/roll-of-the-dice-bobby-jean/"><em>Bobby</em> Jean’s story</a>, of course: ze went away and there was nothing we could have done or said to keep hir from doing otherwise. We didn’t even get to say goodbye.</p>
<p>Hir older sister, Betty, however… oh, she stayed all right, and she made life a mixed blessing for her man.</p>
<p>Let’s take a listen to “Betty Jean,” Bruce’s unreleased outtake from the <em>Born in the U.S.A. </em>sessions, recorded six months earlier than her gender-fluid sibling:</p>
<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="569" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M3i-cVWXKQ" title="Bruce Springsteen - Betty Jean" width="758"></iframe></div>
<p>Well, she’s sure a handful, isn’t she?</p>
<p>Although it’s hard to feel sorry for her boyfriend Bobby (odd coincidence, that)–he’s a bit of a hell-raiser himself. But Betty sure seems to stoke his fire. When we first meet the pair, Bobby’s about to drag race, and Betty is officiating:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Black Mellon Road on a dark mellow night</em><br/>
<em>Two cars pulling up ahead on my right</em><br/>
<em>Going up the highway, gonna see my Betty Jean</em><br/>
<em>She got eyes like a jack rabbit, staring dead at my beams</em></p>
<p>Who won the race? Who knows. Doesn’t matter anyway, that’s not the point. We’re on to their next adventure out in the woods where Betty distractedly cheers Bobby on in a fistfight:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Well over in the woods in a hail door light</em><br/>
<em>Two Red Hills boys in a bare-knuckle fight</em><br/>
<em>Stretched out on the hood of my GTO</em><br/>
<em>She’s filing her nails, shouting, “Go Bobby, go!”</em></p>
<p>Bobby sums Betty up pretty well:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Betty Jean, Betty Jean, Betty Jean</em><br/>
<em>Betty Jean, Betty Jean, Betty Jean</em><br/>
<em>Honey you’re cute, but you sure are mean</em><br/>
<em>Oh Betty Jean</em></p>
<p>Bobby and Betty don’t slow down one bit. Bobby races up the highway while Betty gives him… well, use your imagination (there’s not a lot required):</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Well she jumped in my car, we started driving around</em><br/>
<em>She turned that radio dial, threw her head back and sound</em><br/>
<em>Going up the highway, she was giving me it</em><br/>
<em>She put her hand on my leg, I drove us in a drainage ditch</em></p>
<p>You can’t run forever, though. Sooner or later, life catches up and reality sinks its talons into you. And Bobby learns the lesson of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/03/04/roll-of-the-dice-the-river/">The River</a>,” although it’s not clear they ever had the forethought to dream in the first place.</p>
<p>Bruce gives the last verse of “Betty Jean” a final line just as memorable as the one in “The River,” but a lot less poetic:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Next thing I knew, I was running through the crowd</em><br/>
<em>I swore her my love forever, she was laughing out loud</em><br/>
<em>We were married in the spring out on 531</em><br/>
<em>Had fifteen kids and I hate every single one</em></p>
<p>And there we have it: the tale of Betty Jean, who peaked early while her sibling Bobby Jean escaped with the wind at his back.</p>
<p>A final curiosity about the Jeans: they actually have a <em>third</em> sibling.</p>
<p><em>Beverly</em> Jean made her debut in “<a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/08/28/roll-of-the-dice-delivery-man/">Delivery Man,</a>” another unreleased song from the <em>Born in the U.S.A. Sessions</em>. You can tell Betty and Beverly are sisters because they both have the same “eyes like a jack rabbit starin’ dead in your high beams.”</p>
<p>But Beverly’s story is a tale for another day.</p>
<p>Bobby may have been the only member of the Jean family to make it out into the wide world, but the others still have tales worth telling.</p>
