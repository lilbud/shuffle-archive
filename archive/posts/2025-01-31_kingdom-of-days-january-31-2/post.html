Several tracks from this show are professionally recorded for use on The King Biscuit Flower Hour, but only “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/05/18/roll-of-the-dice-bishop-danced/">Bishop Danced</a>” will be aired. That “Bishop Danced” recording, however, will see the light of day again 25 years later, when it is released on <em>Tracks</em>.</p>

<p>The late show was recorded, too–but only the first two songs have surfaced. But those songs are ultra–rare and heard by very few fans in concert: “Saga of the Architect Angel” and “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/04/10/roll-of-the-dice-song-for-orphans/">Song for Orphans</a>.” Listen to both below.</p>
