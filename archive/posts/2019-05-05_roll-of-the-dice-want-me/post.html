<p>In December 2013, a previously unknown page of original Bruce Springsteen lyrics appeared on an auction site.</p>
<p>Entitled “Want Me,” the song lyrics are written in pencil on a notebook page. The page is undated but almost certainly stems from his pre-Columbia Records days.</p>

<p>The lyrics are a bit tough to make out, but my best guess is below:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>You want me, yes, you want me</em><br/>
<em>I can see it all over your face</em><br/>
<em>I wish I could help you</em><br/>
<em>But I’ve already found my place</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>You see I have this thing to do</em><br/>
<em>And I can’t be in one woman’s arms</em><br/>
<em>But I’m not a bronc, so don’t act thrown</em><br/>
<em>Cause sometimes I get so alone</em><br/>
<em>And that’s when you’re good for me</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>You mean it, yes, you mean it</em><br/>
<em>You mean every damn word you say</em><br/>
<em>I hear you, I hear you</em><br/>
<em>Telling me every day</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>You see I’m not the man who you want me to be</em><br/>
<em>I’m not even sure who he is</em><br/>
<em>So see first things first, babe and that sure ain’t you</em><br/>
<em>You see the good, this big thing to do</em><br/>
<em>But sometimes I get lonely and you’re good to me</em></p>
<p>It’s the song of a (very) young man, that’s for sure. If it’s rooted in real life, it’s almost certainly a reflection of Bruce’s determination to succeed as a musician and not be tied down by a romantic interest. (See “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/07/09/roll-of-the-dice-turn-around/">Turn Around</a>” for another early example of Bruce working through his tug-of-war between professional aspiration and romantic entanglement.</p>
<p>Maddeningly, that’s all we get–there’s a “(cont)” at the bottom of the page, but if there’s any more to the song, it’s been lost to history.</p>
