<p>Shindell, like Bruce, draws from a deep trove of inspiration when he chooses a song to re-interpret; both his studio recordings and stage performances are well worth seeking out.</p>
<p>It was probably inevitable that these two great songwriters would intersect, and although it’s not the first or best time (seek out Shindell’s cover of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/04/26/roll-of-the-dice-4th-of-july-asbury-park-sandy/">4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)</a>“–it’s so gorgeous that it brings a tear to my eye), it’s certainly the most daring.</p>
<p>Shindell truly understands and appreciates “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/09/21/roll-of-the-dice-born-in-the-u-s-a/">Born in the U.S.A</a>.” His arrangement features the pump organ (which Bruce used throughout his 2005 solo acoustic tour), brilliantly adding a dirge-like element without slowing down the song.</p>
<p>Is it as powerful as the blues arrangement that Bruce featured in his acoustic shows? No, but it’s pretty close, and it’s a much more melodic rendition.</p>
