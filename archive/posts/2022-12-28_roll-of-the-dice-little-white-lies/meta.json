I remember thinking that it was an odd choice for inclusion, since lyrically it&#8217;s the same song as &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/12/02/roll-of-the-dice-be-true/\">Be True</a>&#8221; (and for that matter, &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/04/03/roll-of-the-dice-mary-lou/\">Mary Lou</a>&#8220;), so I chalked it up to a curiosity, an example of how Bruce writes lyrics and music independently.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the original bootleg version with the &#8220;Be True&#8221; lyrics&#8211;worth a listen if you&#8217;ve never heard it:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - White Lies (unreleased studio out take)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/siYTOLNj-nI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>When the boxset showed up on my doorstep, I immediately popped the outtake CD in my stereo. As track three started, I recognized the familiar polka-ish melody&#8211;but imagine my surprise when I heard a completely different set of lyrics:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Little White Lies (Studio Outtake - 1979)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/x6hpBol7W0M?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>For years, I&#8217;d wondered why Bruce named that track &#8220;White Lies (Don&#8217;t Do It To Me).&#8221; The parenthetical I get&#8211;that phrase is repeated throughout. But &#8220;White Lies?&#8221; I never could figure out what the connection was between the title and the song.</p>\n<p>Now we know.</p>\n<p>Maybe Bruce had the title and theme picked out and wrote the melody first. Maybe he was just using the lyrics for &#8220;Be True&#8221; to have some words to sing to the melody. Who knows, really? But we do know now that the officially released version of &#8220;Little White Lies&#8221; is a complete and unique addition to Bruce&#8217;s catalog.</p>\n<p>Thematically, &#8220;Little White Lies&#8221; has a lot in common with &#8220;Stolen Car,&#8221; and it&#8217;s possible that it was cast off from the River sessions for that reason. Like in &#8220;Stolen Car,&#8221; the protagonist (Billy) is looking back on the early days of his relationship, remembering and ruing a young love and ardor that was allowed to cool.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>We met on open streets where we both had no place to go</em><br />\n<em>I remember how my heart beat when you said &#8220;Oh Billy, I love you so&#8221;</em><br />\n<em>Now, standing in the doorway, did you ever think that we could look this old</em><br />\n<em>Victims of the little white lies that we told</em></p>\n<p>Notice the parallel composition to &#8220;Stolen Car:&#8221;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>I met a little girl and I settled down</em><br />\n<em>In a little house out on the edge of town</em><br />\n<em>We got married and swore we&#8217;d never part</em><br />\n<em>Then little by little we drifted from each other&#8217;s heart</em></p>\n<p>As the song progresses, Billy feels encroaching doubt, but he allows himself to live in denial:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>We did not count tomorrows, we took what we could and ran</em><br />\n<em>There was no time for sorrow, every place you went I held your hand</em><br />\n<em>And when the night closed in I was sure your kisses told me all I had to know</em><br />\n<em>But they never whispered the little white lies that we told</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>It was so good at the start, nothing could ever pull it apart</em><br />\n<em>Running hand in hand through the rain, but soon the heart break, soon the pain, girl</em></p>\n<p>And then the crux of the song&#8211;the revelation that the titular white lies were actually lies of omission and complicity, the ease of staying in a less-than-ideal relationship with a half-life rather than face the pain of ending it:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>There were no cold denials, nobody really lied</em><br />\n<em>It wasn&#8217;t in the things we said, girl, just time spent, promises implied</em><br />\n<em>And when it began to fall apart eaten quietly away from the inside</em><br />\n<em>Bit by bit by those little white lies</em></p>\n<p>Again, compare with &#8220;Stolen Car,&#8221; which is less explicit and more compact&#8211;establishing in four lines what it takes &#8220;Little White Lies&#8221; ten lines to do.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>At first I thought it was just restlessness</em><br />\n<em>That would fade as time went by and our love grew deep</em><br />\n<em>In the end it was something more I guess</em><br />\n<em>That tore us apart and made us weep</em></p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t want to be too hard on &#8220;Little White Lies&#8221; &#8212; it tells a more vivid story than &#8220;Stolen Car,&#8221; with a more specific diagnosis and an uptempo melody that conveys more frustration and self-reproach than the track that made it on to\u00a0<em>The River</em>. But they&#8217;re similar enough that it wouldn&#8217;t have made sense to include them both.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve often wondered if Bruce went back and listened to &#8220;Little White Lies&#8221; when writing &#8220;Brilliant Disguise.&#8221; There&#8217;s definitely a similarity in theme, and the closing lines of &#8220;Little White Lies&#8221; sound very similar to the closing couplet of &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/02/06/roll-of-the-dice-brilliant-disguise/\">Brilliant Disguise</a>:&#8221;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Now lying here in the dark, did you ever think, ever think that we could be this cold</em><br />\n<em>Just as cold as the little white lies that we told</em></p>\n<p>vs.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Tonight our bed is cold, I&#8217;m lost in the darkness of our love</em><br />\n<em>God have mercy on the man who doubts what he&#8217;s sure of</em></p>\n<p>Coincidence? Perhaps. But I suspect Bruce was haunted for years by a fear of wearing masks in relationships. That theme stopped after the\u00a0<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/08/08/album-companion-tunnel-of-love/\"><em>Tunnel of Love\u00a0</em></a>album. &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/03/17/roll-of-the-dice-better-days/\">Better Days</a>&#8221; sheds some pretty good insight as to why.</p>\n<p>(Bonus: Here&#8217;s an early home demo of Bruce working out the melody for &#8220;Little White Lies,&#8221; sometime in early 1979.)</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen Untitled #3\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gi8uBv5C4A8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><strong>Little White Lies</strong><br />\n<strong>Recorded:</strong> June 1, 1979<br />\n<strong>Released:\u00a0</strong><em>The Ties That Bind: The River Collection\u00a0</em>(2015)<br />\n<strong>Never performed live</strong></p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
