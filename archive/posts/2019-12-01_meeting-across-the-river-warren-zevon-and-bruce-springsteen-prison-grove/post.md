title: "Meeting Across the River: Warren Zevon and Bruce Springsteen, Prison Grove"
---

When Warren Zevon was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, he wrote and recorded a final album, replete with themes of finality and metaphors of mortality. The album was released just two weeks before Zevon’s death.

*The Wind,*

Zevon tapped some friends to help him complete his final work, Bruce among them.

Bruce appears on two songs on the album, including “Prison Grove,” a prison blues song in which the jail serves as a very thinly-veiled metaphor for Zevon’s dying body.

Bruce supplies very recognizable backing vocals on this haunting track.
