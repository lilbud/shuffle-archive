Just in time too, because the list of terrific Springsteen covers keeps growing by the day.</p>\n<p>Take today&#8217;s entry, for instance: a brand-new cover performed live only two nights ago in Portland, Maine, by two artists who are certainly not strangers to Bruce&#8217;s catalog.</p>\n<p>Gregory Alan Isakov has been covering Bruce for at least a decade. While that&#8217;s not exactly surprising for a Philly-raised recording artist, his choice of material might be: he tends to delve deeply into Bruce&#8217;s <a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2023/06/03/album-companion-the-ghost-of-tom-joad/\"><em>The Ghost of Tom Joad </em></a>album.
