**2018:** *Springsteen on Broadway* continues its theatrical run at the Walter Kerr Theater in New York City, with a special invite-only show for Sirius XM radio listeners who entered and won a contest. Emmylou Harris, Katy Perry, Ricky Gervais, and Howard Stern are there tonight as well, but I suspect they procured their tickets through other means.
