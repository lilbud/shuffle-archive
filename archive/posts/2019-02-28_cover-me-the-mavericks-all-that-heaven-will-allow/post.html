<p>Since we’re celebrating the anniversary of the kick-off of the Tunnel of Love Express Tour this week, it seems fitting to spotlight a cover of one of the centerpieces of that tour.</p>
<p>The Mavericks may be a country music band, but they weren’t always. They started out as rockabilly punk, playing gigs with such artists as Marilyn Manson, before eventually cementing themselves as a country band in the 1990s.</p>
<p>Their influences draw from a wide spectrum of artists and styles, a net that includes Bruce Springsteen.</p>
<p>On the band’s third studio album, <em>What a Crying Shame</em> (what a great name for a country album), their fifth single was a cover of Bruce’s beautiful <em><a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/08/08/album-companion-tunnel-of-love/">Tunnel of Love</a> </em>ballad and tour set piece, “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/08/05/roll-of-the-dice-all-that-heaven-will-allow/">All That Heaven Will Allow</a>.”</p>

<p>The song peaked at #49 on the Billboard country chart and has been a concert favorite for the band ever since. Here’s a live performance from The Mavericks’ 2004 concert video, <em>Live in Austin.</em></p>
