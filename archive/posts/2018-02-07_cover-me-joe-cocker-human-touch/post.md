I’ve always thought “[Human Touch](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/08/09/roll-of-the-dice-human-touch/)” cried out for an acoustic arrangement, but surprisingly, Bruce has never tried it (in public, at least).

Joe Cocker shows us how it’s done–turning in a cool, understated, almost swinging take on the song.

It’s a keeper.
