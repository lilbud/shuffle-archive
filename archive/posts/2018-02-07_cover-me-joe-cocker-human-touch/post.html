<p>I’ve always thought “<a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/08/09/roll-of-the-dice-human-touch/">Human Touch</a>” cried out for an acoustic arrangement, but surprisingly, Bruce has never tried it (in public, at least).</p>
<p>Joe Cocker shows us how it’s done–turning in a cool, understated, almost swinging take on the song.</p>
<p>It’s a keeper.</p>
