<p>From late 1981 through early 1982, Bruce recorded a series of acoustic demos at his home in Colts Neck. Several of those compositions became the album we know as <em>Nebraska; </em>others evolved into electric arrangements and would be featured on <em>Born in the U.S.A.</em></p>
<p>A few of them didn’t go anywhere, though, and today’s entry is one of them.</p>
<p>As far as we know, “Wheels Make the World Go Round” never made it past the first two verses we hear in the one-minute clip below, but what we hear is intriguing.</p>

<p>“Wheels Make the World Go Round” is an acoustic demo, but it certainly sounds like it was intended to be a rocker with an earworm melody.</p>
<p>Lyrically, there’s not enough here for us to know exactly where Bruce was headed, but it seems clear that this would have been another entry in his canon of car metaphor songs.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Turning, turning baby round</em><br/>
<em>Spinning baby round and round</em><br/>
<em>Turning underground</em><br/>
<em>Moving, streets of a one-dog town</em><br/>
<em>Wheels make the world go round</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Turning, turning left and goin’ right</em><br/>
<em>Disappear boulevard ???</em><br/>
<em>Wishing, secrets baby to be found</em><br/>
<em>Wheels make the world go round</em><br/>
<em>Baby wheels make the world go round</em></p>
<p>Many of Bruce’s discarded outtakes contained lyrical or musical DNA that found their way to one or more officially released songs, but sadly (because I really like this one) “Wheels Make the World Go Round” appears to be a true dead end.</p>
