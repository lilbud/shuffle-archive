Let&#8217;s take a listen and see how Bruce pulls it off.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Breakaway\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WxBEm7D05yM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>There&#8217;s a lot going on here.\u00a0We&#8217;ll get to the lyrics in a moment, but let&#8217;s start with the homages. The most obvious one is Bruce&#8217;s wink at Roy Orbison&#8217;s &#8220;It&#8217;s Over.&#8221; Not only does Bruce lift the persistent drum riff wholesale, he also borrows Roy&#8217;s melodic phrasing at times.</p>\n<p>Listen to Roy&#8217;s delivery of &#8220;Your baby won&#8217;t be near you any more&#8221; in the audio below, and compare it with Bruce&#8217;s &#8220;now the promises and the lies, they demand it&#8221; in &#8220;Breakaway.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"It&#039;s Over\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HFVoWJhXHSA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>And then of course, there&#8217;s the thematic similarity between the two songs&#8211;they&#8217;re both completely bereft of any hope or light.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s another &#8220;Breakaway&#8221; callback that goes back even further than Orbison&#8217;s classic breakup song: that &#8220;Ronde-Ronde&#8221; chorus, lifted from The Shirelles&#8217; first single, &#8220;I Met Him on a Sunday (Ronde-Ronde).&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"The Shirelles - I Met Him On A Sunday\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EXB_muHAhx0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>What made Bruce choose that curious chorus tribute? I honestly don&#8217;t know. Unlike &#8220;It&#8217;s Over,&#8221; there&#8217;s no thematic or subject matter similarity between &#8220;I Met Him on a Sunday (Ronde-Ronde)&#8221; and &#8220;Breakaway.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Perhaps Bruce was just reaching for that classic, lush sixties ballad sound and was looking for a nonsense chorus typical of the girl group years. Regardless, the choice is striking, almost distracting. It pulls our attention from the verses to the chorus&#8211;and maybe that&#8217;s intentional.</p>\n<p>Because boy, those verses.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s just establish up front that nothing actually happens in &#8220;Breakway.&#8221; There&#8217;s no story arc, no love triangles, no moral dilemmas, nothing&#8211;just three vignettes.</p>\n<p>A gambler gets in too deep and loses everything; a bartender turns a trick in a parking lot; somebody dies out on the street.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s the song.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Sonny abandoned his car last night</em><br />\n<em>Had a meeting on the docks with a light blue Monterrey</em><br />\n<em>To breakaway</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Sonny was playing all his cards last night</em><br />\n<em>In a hotel room he dealt his life away</em><br />\n<em>To breakaway</em></p>\n<p>Perhaps Sonny got off lucky by signing away his car as a gambling loss, but it sure seems likely (given the rest of the song) that the meeting on the docks was a more sinister one&#8211;unable to pay his debts, Sonny is thrown off the pier and drowned.</p>\n<p>Hoping to break away from whatever metaphorical chains bound him, he ended up breaking away from life itself.</p>\n<p>(Sonny will return in &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/10/03/roll-of-the-dice-racing-in-the-street/\">Racing in the Street</a>.&#8221;)</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Now the promises and the lies they demand it</em><br />\n<em>Let the hearts that have been broken stand as the price you pay</em><br />\n<em>To breakaway, oh, breakaway, oh Ronde, Ronde, Ronde, Ronde Ray</em><br />\n<em>To breakaway</em></p>\n<p>Yes, that&#8217;s the chorus for &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/05/20/roll-of-the-dice-badlands/\">Badlands</a>&#8221; you spotted there. Although Bruce was working on &#8220;Badlands&#8221; at the same time he recorded &#8220;Breakaway,&#8221; that iconic line (&#8220;let the broken hearts stand as the price you&#8217;ve gotta pay&#8221;) wouldn&#8217;t migrate to &#8220;Badlands&#8221; until several months later. Bruce isn&#8217;t one to let a great line go to waste.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Janie slipped from behind the bar last night</em><br />\n<em>Cashed out and walked onto streets rainy and grey</em><br />\n<em>To breakaway</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Janie slid into a car last night</em><br />\n<em>In a parking lot she gave her soul away</em><br />\n<em>To breakaway</em></p>\n<p>Whatever ambiguity we find in Sonny&#8217;s vignette, there&#8217;s a lot less in Janie&#8217;s. Dissatisfied with her lot, she turns to sex as a means to escape it. Her fate may not be as final as Sonny&#8217;s, but Bruce implies that she dies a death of a different kind.</p>\n<p>(Don&#8217;t lose heart: Janie will return someday, too.)</p>\n<p>We must also take notice here of what may be the most twisted lyrical/musical juxtaposition in Bruce&#8217;s catalog: the &#8220;sha la la&#8221; backing vocals deliberately meant to evoke the innocence of the girl group era. This is a modern touch, not present in the original 1977 recording; when polishing the song for\u00a0<em>The Promise\u00a0</em>in 2010, Bruce called on Patti, Soozie, and the Alliance Singers to provide those &#8220;sha la las.&#8221;</p>\n<p>We also hear the E Street Horn, a modern addition that unfortunately sounds exactly like the overlay it is, to add even more verdancy.</p>\n<p>Finally, there&#8217;s Bobby, who we meet in his final moments.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Bobby lay &#8216;neath a sheet of stars last night</em><br />\n<em>His back on blacktop still warm from the heat of the day</em><br />\n<em>From breakaway</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Bobby went down hard last night\u00a0</em><br />\n<em>Saw a shooting star as the evening light slipped away\u00a0</em><br />\n<em>From breakaway\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>We have no idea what led to Bobby&#8217;s demise (although the fact that he &#8220;went down hard&#8221; implies some kind of violence), but it&#8217;s clear from the &#8220;sheet of stars&#8221; metaphor that he&#8217;s gone, gone, gone. But in his final moments, he sees a shooting star&#8211;a rare and fleeting glimpse of beauty that momentarily breaks through and ultimately away.</p>\n<p>If there&#8217;s a message to be found at all in &#8220;Breakaway,&#8221; it&#8217;s that no matter how bleak your life may seem, it can always get worse.</p>\n<p>And if you turn to the wrong cure, you may find it more final than the disease.</p>\n<p><strong>Breakaway<br />\nRecorded:</strong> June 1, 1977 (core track)<br />\n<strong>Released:\u00a0</strong><em>The Promise</em> (2010)<br />\n<strong>Never performed</strong></p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
