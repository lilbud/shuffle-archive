<p>Bruce nailed it when he explained Sam and Dave’s appeal on Elvis Costello’s late, lamented <em>Spectacle</em> series:</p>

<p>Nowhere is that magical, heaven-and-earth, Sam and Dave dichotomy more on display than in their gut-wrenching, heart-swelling 1966 hit single “When Something Is Wrong With My Baby,” which peaked at #42 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #2 on the R&amp;B chart in 1967.</p>

<p>But if you’ve only heard Sam and Dave on their studio tracks, you haven’t experienced the power of their performance. As Bruce testified, in person they were mesmerizing.</p>
<p>Take a few minutes to watch their performance from the 1967 Stax/Volt Revue, when their song was still riding the charts. (In fact, the date of the performance was April 7, 1967–the exact day it peaked at #2 on the R&amp;B chart.) It’s missing the first verse, but you’ll still feel the duo’s full power.</p>
<div class="video-player" id="v-5uDR5grZ-1"><iframe allow="clipboard-write" allowfullscreen="" aria-label="VideoPress Video Player" data-resize-to-parent="true" frameborder="0" height="568" src="https://videopress.com/embed/5uDR5grZ" title="VideoPress Video Player" width="758"></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost="ignore" src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js"></script></div>
<p>If that performance doesn’t floor you, you best get someone to take your pulse.</p>
<p>Now, no one would dare dispute the essentialness of Dave Prater’s gritty vocals to the Sam and Dave recipe, but Sam Moore especially commanded Bruce’s respect as a bandleader. Bruce appreciated Dave, but he <em>studied</em> Sam–and he incorporated those lessons into his own performances.</p>
<p>So it must have been a thrill for Bruce when he had the opportunity to perform classic Sam and Dave songs with Sam during his 2003 holiday shows in Asbury Park.</p>
<p>It wasn’t the first time Sam and Bruce had worked together. In fact, Sam appears on Bruce’s studio recordings of “Soul Driver,” “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/07/25/roll-of-the-dice-real-world/">Real World</a>” and “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/05/30/roll-of-the-dice-mans-job/">Man’s Job</a>.”</p>
<p>But it was their first time performing on stage together, and Bruce clearly relished the opportunity. They brought the crowd to their feet each night with rousing rockers like “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/08/20/matr-bruce-springsteen-and-sam-moore-i-thank-you/">I Thank You</a>” and “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/04/24/matr-bruce-springsteen-and-sam-moore-hold-on-im-comin/">Hold On, I’m Comin’</a>,” but for me the highlight was their team-up on Sam and Dave’s only hit ballad, “When Something is Wrong With My Baby.”</p>

<p>Bruce is clearly in awe of his idol throughout their performance, but he summons Dave’s gritty, earthy vocals when called on. Their harmonies are wonderful, and Sam’s stage patter and command of the crowd is delightful.</p>
<p>Sam and Bruce only performed “When Something Is Wrong With My Baby” three times (in a four-day period!) back in the 2003 holiday season, but they made those few performances count.</p>
