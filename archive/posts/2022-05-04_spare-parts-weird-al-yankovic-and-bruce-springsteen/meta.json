He&#8217;s got a great sense of humor.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He certainly does. In fact, Bruce and Al share a certain silly sensibility, and that&#8217;s probably why they&#8217;ve developed an improbable friendship dating all the way back to their teens&#8211;a fact Bruce divulged in a surprisingly provocative and wide-ranging 1985 interview on ALTV.</p>\n<p>In the clip below, Al poses a series of questions I&#8217;ve never seen any other interviewer ask, and to his credit, Bruce gamely answers every one of them. This is essential viewing for any Springsteen fan.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic - The Bruce Springsteen Interview\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wudovyyvKDU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Bruce and Al are such good friends that Bruce invited Al to the set a couple of years later for the filming of the video for &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/02/06/roll-of-the-dice-brilliant-disguise/\">Brilliant Disguise</a>.&#8221; Of course, with Yankovic on the scene, hilarity was bound to ensue. In the rarely seen alternate and unreleased cut of Bruce&#8217;s famously somber video, we see the artist doing his best to keep a straight face while his buddy does his best to make him laugh.
