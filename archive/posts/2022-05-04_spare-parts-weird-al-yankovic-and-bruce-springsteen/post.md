“Weird Al” Yankovic has parodied just about every iconic artist and anthem over the last four decades, but he’s never taken a swing at Bruce Springsteen.

“It’s just never worked out for me to do a straight-on Springsteen parody,” Yankovic told ScreenCrush in 2014. “Either the timing wasn’t right, or he didn’t have a big enough single at the time my album was coming out, or I just flat out couldn’t think of a clever enough idea for one of his songs… but it’s not because he doesn’t have a good sense of humor. He’s got a great sense of humor.”

He certainly does. In fact, Bruce and Al share a certain silly sensibility, and that’s probably why they’ve developed an improbable friendship dating all the way back to their teens–a fact Bruce divulged in a surprisingly provocative and wide-ranging 1985 interview on ALTV.

In the clip below, Al poses a series of questions I’ve never seen any other interviewer ask, and to his credit, Bruce gamely answers every one of them. This is essential viewing for any Springsteen fan.

Bruce and Al are such good friends that Bruce invited Al to the set a couple of years later for the filming of the video for “[Brilliant Disguise](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/02/06/roll-of-the-dice-brilliant-disguise/).” Of course, with Yankovic on the scene, hilarity was bound to ensue. In the rarely seen alternate and unreleased cut of Bruce’s famously somber video, we see the artist doing his best to keep a straight face while his buddy does his best to make him laugh. (It also includes what is to my knowledge their one and only musical performance together.)

Bruce and Al may be besties, but that doesn’t mean they aren’t also rivals. When Bruce’s *Human Touch* and *Lucky Town* albums failed to hold their spots on the album charts, Springsteen enviously but good-naturedly name-checked his friend from the stage in his 1992 rehearsal show and radio broadcast.

It’s been years since Bruce and Al have been seen in public together, but a friendship like theirs was built to stand the test of time. Both artists are still remarkably prolific and relevant, and both are still active stage performers. It’s only a matter of time before we’re treated to their next collaboration.
