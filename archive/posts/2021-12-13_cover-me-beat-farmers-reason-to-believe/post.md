It was their novelty song “Happy Boy” that was the breakout song from their first album, and that’s unfortunate because their proper blend and brand of west coast country punk never got the the airplay it deserved. Their cover of “Reason to Believe” successfully electrified one of the stubborn songs that Bruce could never quite wire up back in the early eighties.
