One of the very first songs she performed in that series was a lonely, frustrated cover of &#8220;Dancing in the Dark.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Dancing In The Dark - Bruce Springsteen (cover)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wyMazpH60tI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Bruce&#8217;s song of disconnection resonated with Jane long after she released that video. Now, a year later, she&#8217;s released a new studio cover of &#8220;Dancing in the Dark&#8221; as a single in a new arrangement&#8211;still lonely, but this time with a note of hope and optimism and a video performance by Fred Astaire from <em>Royal Wedding</em> that will surely bring a smile to your face.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Jane Willow - Dancing In The Dark | Bruce Springsteen [Official Video]\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jjwoe5hS4Wc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;This song helped me make sense of the endless lockdown,&#8221; Jane wrote in a Facebook post. &#8220;Ireland has had one of the longest and strictest lockdowns in Europe. And I will never forget these lockdowns and the sense of loneliness and disconnectedness I felt. But I also felt connected with the world through my YouTube channel, through these live videos I do. So this song, I suppose is my thank you to those that have watched these videos and reached out in some way.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Jane&#8217;s single is available for purchase at Bandcamp.
