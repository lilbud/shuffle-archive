<p>I told myself I’d lay low with the “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/12/25/roll-of-the-dice-dancing-in-the-dark/">Dancing in the Dark</a>” covers for a bit, but I love this new one too much to keep it on the shelf.</p>
<p>Jane Willow is a Dutch-turned-Irish folk artist with wonderful original music featured on <a href="https://www.janewillow.com/media">her web site</a>.</p>
<p>Jane is working on her debut album, but like many artists, when the 2020 pandemic forced her from the stage, she started a weekly streaming series of acoustic performances. One of the very first songs she performed in that series was a lonely, frustrated cover of “Dancing in the Dark.”</p>

<p>Bruce’s song of disconnection resonated with Jane long after she released that video. Now, a year later, she’s released a new studio cover of “Dancing in the Dark” as a single in a new arrangement–still lonely, but this time with a note of hope and optimism and a video performance by Fred Astaire from <em>Royal Wedding</em> that will surely bring a smile to your face.</p>

<p>“This song helped me make sense of the endless lockdown,” Jane wrote in a Facebook post. “Ireland has had one of the longest and strictest lockdowns in Europe. And I will never forget these lockdowns and the sense of loneliness and disconnectedness I felt. But I also felt connected with the world through my YouTube channel, through these live videos I do. So this song, I suppose is my thank you to those that have watched these videos and reached out in some way.”</p>
<p>Jane’s single is available for purchase at Bandcamp. If you like it, consider purchasing it <a href="https://janewillowmusic.bandcamp.com/track/dancing-in-the-dark">here</a>.</p>
