This week, it seems like everyone in my adopted hometown of Seattle is attending (or wishing they could) a pair of benefit shows by one of our local bands to combat and raise awareness about local homelessness. What started out as a concert has swelled into a community-wide movement. I’m sure Bruce approves of and is impressed by what his friend Eddie and crew have accomplished.

In honor of [#TheHomeShows](https://pearljam.com/thehomeshows/seattle-wa), here’s Pearl Jam’s one-off cover of Bruce’s “[Open All Night](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/10/28/roll-of-the-dice-open-all-night/),” captured live in Lincoln, Nebraska on October 9, 2014.

Bruce only plays “Open All Night” in two modes–acoustic or swing–so it’s great to see it in a full-on rock arrangement (and rock it certainly does). Maybe someday we’ll get to see the E Street Band give it a run.

In the meantime, if you’re going to one or both of these sure-to-be-epic shows, enjoy the experience–and thank you.
