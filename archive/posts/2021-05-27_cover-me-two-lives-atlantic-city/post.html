<p>Now <em>this</em> is how you cover a song.</p>
<p>Find its essence, transform it via a new arrangement, and reveal something hidden within it all along.</p>
<p>Two Lives does all that while turning in a spectacular music performance and a stylish video that’s sure to be a strong contender at <a href="https://www.noiespringsteen.com/contest/">this year’s <em>Cover Me</em> contest</a>.</p>
<p>The song is Bruce Springsteen’s fatalistic “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/06/04/roll-of-the-dice-atlantic-city/">Atlantic City,</a>” and the band turns it into a song of hope and resilience against life’s vicissitudes. Their version is still dark and despairing, but with a subtext of defiance rather than denial.</p>

<p>I don’t know much about Two Lives. As far as I can tell, they’re an Italian wedding band consisting of Serena Graziano on vocals, Diego Pavoni on guitar, and Matteo Massobrio on bass and piano–and their social media presence consists of just this one cover.</p>
<p>But if this one cover is indicative of their musical and interpretive ability, I certainly want to hear more.</p>
<p>This year’s<em> Cover Me </em> contest is turning out to have a very high bar.</p>
