title: Disorder in the House

In the summer of 2002, Warren Zevon was diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer and immediately began working on what he knew would be his final album.

In December, he asked Bruce to join him on the album’s second track, “Disorder in the House.” Bruce flew out to Cherokee Studios in Hollywood and contributed his backing vocals and several scorching guitar solos for what became the album’s standout track.

VH1 aired behind-the-scenes footage of Warren and Bruce’s recording session in a documentary about the album.

Warren lived just long enough to see their performance debut to fan and critical acclaim alike, but he passed away before he won his first-ever Grammy, for Best Rock Vocal Performance (Group or Duo).

Here’s Warren and Bruce’s award-winning performance.
