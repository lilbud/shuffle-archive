With soaring vocals and a backing track filled with sublime strings, castanets and kettle drums, horns and harps, &#8220;Then He Kissed Me&#8221; has a lush sound that can&#8217;t help but enchant even the least romantic among us.</p>\n<p>And Bruce is nothing if not a romantic.</p>\n<p>He&#8217;s not alone. &#8220;Then He Kissed Me&#8221; was a huge hit when it was originally released in the summer of 1963, peaking at #6 on the Billboard Hot 100. It was still remembered fondly a decade later when Bruce brought it back to the stage during his tour behind <em>The Wild, The Innocent &amp; The E Street Shuffle.</em></p>\n<p>He played it a few times that summer and autumn, and when he took the E Street Band back out on tour the following summer to promote\u00a0<em>Born to Run</em>, &#8220;Then She Kissed Me&#8221; was a staple throughout the month of August, including and most especially at his legendary breakthrough stand at The Bottom Line in New York City.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - 04 - Then she kissed me (from &quot;The punk meets the godfather&quot;)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hHFjL-XDlHE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Bruce&#8217;s cover was superbly faithful, although he made one very noticeable change: Much later in his career, Bruce would grow more comfortable singing from a woman&#8217;s or a gay man&#8217;s perspective, but in 1975 he apparently felt more comfortable flipping gender pronouns and retitling the song, &#8220;Then She Kissed Me.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Then again, he wasn&#8217;t the first cover artist who felt the need to invert &#8220;Then He Kissed Me.&#8221; The Beach Boys did that first back in 1965, and a lot more awkwardly to boot. (&#8220;Her&#8221; is an awful word to hold a note on, and Al Jardine had to swallow it each time.)</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"The Beach Boys - Then I kissed Her ( stereo  mix  )\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hiOX3gtCAFA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;Then She Kissed Me&#8221; was an early highlight each time it appeared in Bruce&#8217;s set, and yet it was gone from his set lists by the time Labor Day rolled around.</p>\n<p>Bruce didn&#8217;t perform it again for thirty-three years&#8230; to the day. Whether he knew it or not (probably not), Bruce chose the anniversary of the day he&#8217;d last played &#8220;Then She Kissed Me&#8221; to perform it again, opening his instantly legendary Magic Tour show in St. Louis with it on <a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/08/23/where-the-band-was-st-louis-august-23-2008/\">August 23, 2008</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen--Then She Kissed Me (Scottrade Center, St. Louis, August 23, 2008)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hUzP8DQyBD0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>That was no audible, and to the best of my knowledge it wasn&#8217;t by request. Bruce just seemed to be in a 1975 mood that night&#8211;those of us in the lottery line outside the arena were able to hear him soundcheck not just &#8220;Then She Kissed Me&#8221; but also &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/10/08/cover-me-when-you-walk-in-the-room/\">When You Walk in the Room</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/12/11/cover-me-little-queenie/\">Little Queenie</a>,&#8221; two other notable 1975 tour covers. Not only that, he even played &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/09/21/cover-me-mountain-of-love/\">Mountain of Love</a>&#8221; during the show by request. (You can listen in on that soundcheck below.)</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYTbeoe2Lc</p>\n<p>Bruce performed &#8220;Then She Kissed Me&#8221; once more (by request this time) the following summer in Sunrise, Florida, but it&#8217;s been absent from his set list ever since.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s clearly a song for which Bruce has a great deal of affection, though, so all it might take is a well-positioned sign on the next tour for &#8220;Then She Kissed Me&#8221; to make a return visit.</p>\n<p><strong>Then (S)he Kissed Me<br />\nFirst performed:</strong> July 13, 1974 (New
