<p>It occurred to me to day that I’m about a month into this blog and have yet to spotlight a cover of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/09/11/roll-of-the-dice-im-on-fire/">I’m on Fire</a>.”</p>
<p>That needs to change–if only because there are SO MANY covers of this song out there, and if I don’t start soon, we’re going to end up needing an “I’m on Fire” month at some point, and as great as the song is, no one wants that.</p>
<p>So let’s kick things off, with this <em>very</em> different take on “I’m on Fire” by Twin Shadow. He actually captures the steamy, late-night vibe of this song really well, placing him pretty high up on my list of “I’m on Fire” coverers. Enjoy.</p>
