Seeger co-wrote the song in 1949 with Lee Hays and released it in 1950 with The Weavers.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"The Hammer Song (If I had a hammer) - The Weavers - (Lyrics)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FSUsyzUFcKs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>The song wasn&#8217;t a hit for The Weavers, but when Peter, Paul, and Mary covered it twelve years later, it shot into the Top Ten and scored a pair of Grammy Awards.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Peter, Paul and Mary - If I Had A Hammer (1963 performance)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XxWTDcP9Y5E?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>A year later, the song hit the Top Ten\u00a0<em>again</em> (all the way to #3, in fact) with a very different arrangement by Trini Lopez.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Trini Lopez - If I Had A Hammer (1963) - HD\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Kp1z8EzZ5Hs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;If I Had a Hammer&#8221; quickly established itself as an American folk classic, and over the years it would be covered by everyone from Sam Cooke to Leonard Nimoy.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"If I Had A Hammer (The Hammer Song)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Awn_qRWFFsI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Naturally, Bruce covered it too, at the very last Seeger session. Running counter to most previous versions, Bruce&#8217;s arrangement is more brooding than clarion. Mark Clifford&#8217;s banjo and the dual violins (both Soozie and Sam Bardfeld play on this track) take the song back to its roots&#8211;it sounds like an arrangement one might have heard in the heartland in the late 1940s.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"If I Had a Hammer (The Hammer Song)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jOhvQeg2i0c?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Unfortunately, Bruce&#8217;s vocals are far from their best here. We have to assume that was by intention, since the other songs from these sessions feature Bruce in fine voice, but &#8220;If I Had a Hammer&#8221; sounds very much like Bruce just rolled out of bed and started singing.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, &#8220;If I Had a Hammer (The Hammer Song)&#8221; is a fine entry in the Seeger Sessions library and would be a natural and welcome addition to the setlist on the next (fingers crossed) Sessions Band tour.</p>\n<p><strong>If I Had a Hammer (The Hammer Song)<br />\nRecorded:</strong> January 21, 2006<br />\n<strong>Released:</strong>\u00a0<em>Roots and Branches</em> (2018)<br />\n<strong>Never performed</strong></p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
