title: Can’t Teach an Old Dog New Tricks

Twenty years after Bruce last collaborated on vinyl with Gary U.S. Bonds (well, 22 years, but who’s counting?), Bruce lent his talents to Gary once more on Bonds’ 2004 album, (Get it?)

*Back in 20.*

Unlike and which bore Bruce’s imprint all over, Bruce’s contribution to was more modest, limited only to a single track.

*Dedication**On the Line,* *Back in 20*

What a track it is, though. It may not be Springsteen-penned (songwriting credit goes to Bonds and Laurie Anderson), but “Can’t Teach an Old Dog New Tricks” rockets out of the gate on the power of Bruce’s guitar and Southside Johnny’s harmonica.

Bruce’s backing vocals, wails, and call-and-response are prominent throughout as well, right up to his affectionate “Come on, Bondsie!” during the coda.

“Can’t Teach an Old Dog New Tricks” is a rocking, rollicking, but under-the-radar track from some old dogs managing just fine, thank you.
