Bruce has played “I Saw Her Standing There” three times on stage (documented, at least), always with at least one Beatle present to play their 1963 classic.

Everyone’s seen Bruce’s 2012 Hyde Park performance with Paul McCartney… it was the infamous show where the power got pulled immediately after when Bruce and Paul broke the local curfew by playing “Twist and Shout.”

…and you may have caught the encore almost a year ago today, when Bruce and Steve turned up at Paul’s 2017 Madison Square Garden gig to reprise it.

…but IMO, neither performance beats the first time Bruce played it, at the third annual Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York.

This was the year The Beatles were inducted, but McCartney boycotted the ceremony due to unresolved business disputes, leaving George and Ringo to share the stage with other rock royalty: Mick Jagger, Billy Joel, and Bruce Springsteen (and all-star backing band).

Just try to watch this without breaking into a goofy grin when Bruce takes the mic–he’s clearly having the time of his life.
