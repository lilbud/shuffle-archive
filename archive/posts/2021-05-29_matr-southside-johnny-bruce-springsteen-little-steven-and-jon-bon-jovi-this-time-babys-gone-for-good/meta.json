Stone\u00a0</em>album could almost be considered a Little Steven album, too.</p>\n<p>Steve Van Zandt is all over Southside&#8217;s 1978 LP&#8211;Steve not only plays and sings throughout the album, he also produced it and wrote or co-wrote all but two of its songs.\u00a0And although it&#8217;s hard to pick a favorite track from such a great album, if you pressed me I&#8217;d have to go with &#8220;This Time Baby&#8217;s Gone For Good.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"This Time Baby&#039;s Gone for Good (2016 Remaster)\" width=\"758\"

influences and perfectly tailored for The Asbury Juke&#8217;s brassy Jersey Shore sound.</p>\n<p>It seemed a lock that Bruce would perform it with Steve and Southside in one of their many appearances together, and in 1998 that finally happened.\u00a0At a benefit show to raise money for the family of a slain local police officer, Bruce and Southside took rare supporting roles while Steve sang the lead on his twenty-year-old song.</p>\n<div id=\"v-9qVbrl1k-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='568'

occasion they were joined by a friend.</p>\n<p>At Bruce&#8217;s Asbury Park holiday show on December 7, 2003, Jon Bon Jovi joined Bruce on backing vocals while Southside and Steve traded lead vocals on a magnificently captured performance of &#8220;This Time Baby&#8217;s Gone For Good.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Jon Bon Jovi (ft. more) - This
