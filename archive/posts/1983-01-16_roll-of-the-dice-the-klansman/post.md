On March 10, 1983, Bruce sat down in his new home studio in his Los Angeles home, switched on a drum machine, and recorded “The Klansman,” a dark reminiscence of a home visit by a KKK recruiter through the eyes of a child.

Unlike many of other acoustic outtakes from this period, “The Klansman” is virtually fully formed. There are a few lyrical rough edges that suggest that Bruce wasn’t quite done polishing it, but it’s clearly “content complete.” It features Bruce in the taut storytelling mode of his recent *Nebraska* album, but it isn’t hard to imagine “The Klansman” in an electric arrangement on *Born in the U.S.A.* 

The melody is sinister and foreboding (Bruce plays every instrument); we know that something bad is afoot almost before Bruce lays it out in the opening verse:

*Word of the trouble spread around*  
*One day a man came to my town*  
*In the kitchen when my Pa let him in*  
*He shook my hand, said, “Son, the Klan’s your friend”*

We never learn what the “trouble” is, but given the greeting of the mysterious visitor, it isn’t hard to imagine. The recruiter continues–presumably addressing the father now:

*“Was a meeting at Lyle Stanton’s house on the Jefferson Highway*  
*Some they did not listen, some did not turn away”*

*Said, “When the holy rain of fire comes tumbling from above*  
*It’ll be a Klansman who stands for the land he loves”*  
*Look away, look away now*

That’s a pretty strong pitch. We’re left to wonder how the father will react during a short instrumental interlude, and then the story continues, some time later:

*I was ten years old when my Pa said, “Son, someday you will see*  
*When you grow to wear the robes like your brother and me”*

*“When the war between the races lives as in a fiery dream*  
*It’ll be a Klansman who will wipe this country clean*  
*This, son, is my dream”*

Bruce’s vocals give nothing away–his delivery is unflinching. We can discern neither a young boy’s pride in his father nor a grown man’s shame.

We’re left to wonder which path the boy chose for himself, which is undoubtedly the exact effect Bruce was aiming for.

Rumors still fly about a someday-soon box set treatment for *Born in the U.S.A.* and its contemporary outtakes. Odds are good–or at least they *should* be–that “The Klansman” will finally see a release if and when.

**Update: December 2025:** We did finally get that official release this year, although it was released on *L.A. Garage Sessions ’83* as part of *Tracks II* instead of a *Born in the U.S.A.* box set. “The Klansman” is a lost track that very much deserved to be found.
