“Disgusted” was recorded by Melvin “Lil’ Son” Jackson back in 1951, but it remained in the vault for years, finally seeing the light of day on a 1968 compilation album.

Lucinda Williams has covered it in concert over the decades, too many times to count; she even included a live performance of it on as a bonus track on her 1998 reissue of her self-titled third album.

When Lucinda’s 2006 tour intersected with Bruce’s Seeger Sessions Tour in London, Bruce made a surprise guest appearance, joining Lucinda’s band for two songs. One of those songs–Lucinda’s own ““–has been floating around youtube for many years.

The other song, however, is much harder to find for some reason. So here it is, newly uploaded–enjoy Bruce’s only known performance of “Disgusted.” (He plays guitar only, no vocals.)
