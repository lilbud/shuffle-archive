**1985:** At Pittsburgh’s Three Rivers Stadium, Nils and Roy miss their signal to take the stage, so Bruce starts the show and plays “[Born in the U.S.A.](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/09/21/roll-of-the-dice-born-in-the-u-s-a/)” without them. Bruce will do a pre-show headcount ever after.

Later in the show: the first “New York City Serenade” in 24 years, and the show-closing tour premiere of “[4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/04/26/roll-of-the-dice-4th-of-july-asbury-park-sandy/).”
