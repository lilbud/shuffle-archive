**1985:** At Pittsburgh’s Three Rivers Stadium, Nils and Roy miss their signal to take the stage, so Bruce starts the show and plays “[Born in the U.S.A.](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/09/21/roll-of-the-dice-born-in-the-u-s-a/)” without them. Bruce will do a pre-show headcount ever after.

**1999:** It’s the penultimate show of Bruce and the E Street Band’s fifteen-night Reunion Tour stand at East Rutherford’s Continental Airlines Arena, and the show rockets out of the gate with the first performance of “[Night](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/10/31/roll-of-the-dice-night/)” in 15 years. Later in the show: the first “New York City Serenade” in 24 years, and the show-closing tour premiere of “[4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/04/26/roll-of-the-dice-4th-of-july-asbury-park-sandy/).”

**2003:** Bruce and the E Street Band wrap up their three-show Rising stand at Philadelphia’s Lincoln Financial Field in peak form, opening with “From Small Things (Big Things One Day Come),” and tour premiering “[I’m Goin’ Down](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/06/05/roll-of-the-dice-im-goin-down/)” and “[Pretty Flamingo](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/12/04/cover-me-pretty-flamingo/)” (the latter of which hadn’t been played in 25 years). Throw in a rare “[Incident on 57th Street](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/12/14/roll-of-the-dice-incident-on-57th-street/)” “[Be True](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/12/02/roll-of-the-dice-be-true/),” and a show-closing “[I’m a Rocker](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/09/18/roll-of-the-dice-im-a-rocker/),” and you’ve got the makings of a killer setlist. And then there’s that “[Ramrod](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/09/10/roll-of-the-dice-ramrod/)” under a full moon…
