One of the most unexpected Bruce covers is an absolute must-listen: Tom Jones completely reinvents “The Hitter” in a smoldering interpretation.

Jones’ take on the song’s protagonist is unapologetic–he owns his deeds and wraps himself in his sins, and the result is a very different song than Bruce’s original.
