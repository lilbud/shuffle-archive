<p>Hi!</p>
<p>I try not to clutter up your inbox with my miscellaneous notes (my last one was ten months ago), but I felt like it was time to acknowledge what’s probably obvious by now if you’ve been stopping by for more than the last month or two.</p>
<p>I’m about four-and-a-half years into this crazy mission to document, analyze, and otherwise celebrate every song Bruce Springsteen is known to have released, performed, covered, gifted, or otherwise put his stamp on, and for the first 1,270 days or so I somehow managed to do that on a daily basis—two posts a day, every day, without fail.</p>
<p>But over the last year, life happened. I took a long vacation; my dad died; my granddaughter was born; live music returned; work got busier than ever; new friendships blossomed.</p>
<p>And as a result, my posting schedule got a bit unpredictable, and occasional skip days and weeks crept onto the calendar. No one complained of course–I don’t pretend to think that this site affects anyone’s day that much one way or the other–but I like being dependable, so it bothered me.</p>
<p>So some weeks back, I made the decision to put this site on half-time status… sort of. This means:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/category/kingdom-of-days/"><em>Kingdom of Days</em></a> still runs daily, without interruption.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/category/roll-of-the-dice/">Roll of the Dice,</a> <a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/category/cover-me/">Cover Me</a>, <a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/category/meeting-across-the-river/">Meeting Across the River</a>,</em> and <a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/category/spare-parts/"><em>Spare Parts</em></a> all share an “every other day” posting schedule–three or four posts a week in total.</li>
</ul>
<p>This schedule change gives me a lot of time back in my week, and (so far, at least) enables me to keep a regular cadence going.</p>
<p>It also adds a couple of other benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>I now have time to add new video to <em>Kingdom of Days</em> posts that can’t be found on YouTube (see <a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/05/07/kingdom-of-days-may-7/">today’s post</a> for two examples).</li>
<li>New posts will continue at least into 2023, maybe longer if Bruce releases or covers new music during that time. (Originally, I’d planned to wrap up the site this year.)</li>
</ul>
<p>One thing’s certain: I have no intention of stopping until we make it through every song–and there’s still about 200 left to go.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading this far, this long, and this regularly. I hope life is full for you too, and that we all have the chance to be together at a show someday soon!</p>
