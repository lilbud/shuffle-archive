(The song is so light that it would collapse if he did.)</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>No one ever found it, ain&#8217;t no school ever taught it</em><br />\n<em>No one ever made it, ain&#8217;t no one ever bought it</em><br />\n<em>Baby you&#8217;ve got it, baby you&#8217;ve got it</em><br />\n<em>Come on and give it to me</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Ain&#8217;t no one can break it, there ain&#8217;t no one can steal it</em><br />\n<em>Ain&#8217;t no one can fake it, you just know it when you feel it</em><br />\n<em>Baby you&#8217;ve got it, baby you&#8217;ve got it</em><br />\n<em>Come on and give it to me</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Yeah, you can&#8217;t read it in a book, and you can&#8217;t even dream it</em><br />\n<em>Honey, it ain&#8217;t got a name, you just know it when you see it</em><br />\n<em>Baby you&#8217;ve got it, yeah, baby you&#8217;ve got it</em><br />\n<em>Come on and give it to me</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well, now listen up, your reckless love is precious so don&#8217;t waste it</em><br />\n<em>Can&#8217;t tell you what they made it of, but I know it when I taste it</em><br />\n<em>Baby you&#8217;ve got it, yeah, baby you&#8217;ve got it</em><br />\n<em>You&#8217;ve got it in your bones and blood, yeah, you&#8217;re real as real ever was</em><br />\n<em>Baby you&#8217;ve got it, yeah, baby you&#8217;ve got it</em><br />\n<em>Come on and give it to me</em></p>\n<p>So what is it? Charisma, perhaps. Chemistry, maybe. Animal magnetism, sexiness, the power of persuasion, take your pick amongst a spectrum of intangible, invisible, unmeasurable qualities. (Although &#8220;come on and give it to me&#8221; is such a recognizable come-on that my bet is on sex appeal.)</p>\n<p>Ultimately, it doesn&#8217;t really matter&#8211;&#8220;You&#8217;ve Got It&#8221; is just Bruce having fun (as do the multitude of musicians on the track&#8211;yes, that&#8217;s the &#8220;Glory Days&#8221; riff you instantly recognized), and it&#8217;s enough for us to listen to it the same way.</p>\n<p>Bruce perhaps does his song a disservice introducing it to us in the middle of his masterful <a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2023/03/28/album-companion-wrecking-ball/\"><em>Wrecking Ball\u00a0</em></a>album; try listening to it on a playlist of his pop songs and it fares much better.</p>\n<p>Still, graded on a curve that includes only the poppier songs in Bruce&#8217;s catalog, &#8220;You&#8217;ve Got It&#8221; is middle-of-the-pack at best. It lacks the buoyancy and hidden narcissism that makes &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/09/27/roll-of-the-dice-waitin-on-a-sunny-day/\">Waitin&#8217; on a Sunny Day</a>&#8221; so timelessly appealing, and it&#8217;s nowhere near as infectious as &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/06/21/roll-of-the-dice-lions-den/\">Lion&#8217;s Den</a>&#8221; or &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/06/17/roll-of-the-dice-give-the-girl-a-kiss/\">Give the Girl a Kiss</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Far be it from me to understand (let alone explain) what makes a perfect pop song, but one thing I know about Bruce&#8217;s best ones are that after hearing them once, they demand that you sing them. On that front, &#8220;You&#8217;ve Got It&#8230;&#8221; not so much.</p>\n<p>Bruce tried it live, once. The set up was a bit awkward, as you&#8217;ll see in the clip below, but Bruce&#8217;s performance was fun.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"You&#039;ve got it - Bruce Springsteen Bergen, Norway 2012-07-24 - New version\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6XT_bGKGFVs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Fun, yes, but that one and only live performance of &#8220;You&#8217;ve Got It&#8221; didn&#8217;t get a particularly Springsteenian crowd reaction, and Bruce seemed very aware of that during his performance.
