There&#8217;s no message, and nothing happens; instead, he creates a stark portrait of a hopeless poverty:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Golden horses ride down the city streets</em><br />\n<em>Starving children clutter beneath their feet</em><br />\n<em>&#8216;Cause they haven&#8217;t had enough to eat</em><br />\n<em>And the sweat drips from their bones in the heat</em><br />\n<em>Of today&#8217;s sun</em></p>\n<p>That&#8217;s a powerful opening verse&#8211;for an eighteen-year-old who didn&#8217;t enjoy school, Bruce was already expertly using language to convey a powerful image. We could nitpick, I suppose: was it really necessary to state that the children were starving when he more poetically expressed it by describing their sweat as dripping from their bones? Perhaps he wasn&#8217;t confident yet in his poetry and wanted to make sure. But the use of the word &#8220;clutter&#8221; to convey just how insignificant these children are to the unseen riders of the &#8220;golden horses&#8221; shows that Bruce had already honed his lifelong talent for surgically precise lyrics.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>In their houses the rats have eaten all of the meat</em><br />\n<em>down the hallways weary travelers often meet</em><br />\n<em>and lay together in a drunken sleep</em><br />\n<em>like all the dirt that needs to be sweeped</em><br />\n<em>Up tomorrow</em></p>\n<p>Similar to the &#8220;clutter&#8221; of children above, Bruce uses simile here to imply the insignificance and disposability of the vagrants.</p>\n<p>But it&#8217;s the third verse that is the gem of the song:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Broken ladies on street corners with plate-glass eyes</em><br />\n<em>Frozen babies wake the morning with a cry</em><br />\n<em>As sewage pipes try to harmonize</em><br />\n<em>With a sweet young mother&#8217;s sighs</em><br />\n<em>That color the night</em></p>\n<p>That entire verse is magnificent: from the broken ladies whose plate-glass eyes convey both outer fragility and inner disassociation simultaneously; to the frozen babies that imply the severity of the impoverished families that can&#8217;t even afford heat; to the notion of finding music in the blend of sewage pipes and hopeless sighs, when it can&#8217;t be found anywhere else&#8211;there&#8217;s so much packed into these five lines. To my mind, this stands tall among the best of Bruce&#8217;s early lyrics. And once again: he was eighteen!</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the last verse can&#8217;t sustain that peak, and Bruce slips a little into literal explanation:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>When all have vanished there, still the hobo will sleep</em><br />\n<em>for his bed is the gutter, the only home he knows is the street</em><br />\n<em>He wakes in the morning and everything&#8217;s gone</em><br />\n<em>then vomits gently in the dawn</em><br />\n<em>Of tomorrow, of tomorrow</em></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a weak verse, but it has a killer final image: the hobo vomiting gently into the dawn is a crudely beautiful outro, the ugly quiet that passes for peace in this somber scene.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Slum Sentiments&#8221; feels more like a poem than a song, and perhaps it&#8217;s for the best that we may never know what Bruce had in mind musically, and whether this was intended end-state or just a backdrop to develop something fuller. But it provides us with another window into a rapidly developing songwriter honing his already impressive skills.</p>\n<p><strong>Slum Sentiments<br />\nNever recorded<br />\nNever\u00a0</strong><b>performed</b></p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
