<p>“California Sun” cracked the Billboard Hot 100 twice, but neither time was by a west coast band.</p>
<p>New Orleans-based Joe Jones was the first to record it, and he took it to #89 in 1961.</p>

<p>More famously, The Rivieras covered it in 1964 and commanded the #5 spot on the chart for a solid ten weeks.</p>

<p>So if a New Orleans R&amp;B singer and an Indiana-based rock band can lay claim to the last great American rock hit before the British Invasion swept the country, why not a New Jersey rock icon?</p>
<p>Bruce Springsteen flirted with “California Sun” a few times over the years, quoting it upon occasion (the occasions being California concerts) in “<a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/12/27/cover-me-detroit-medley/">Detroit Medley</a>” or “<a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/12/06/roll-of-the-dice-light-of-day/">Light of Day</a>.”</p>
<p>But he’s only played it properly in concert once: with the E Street Band at the late L.A. Sports Arena on the evening of April 26, 2012.</p>
<p>Here’s that one-time-only performance, clearly influenced more by The Rivieras’ version rather than Joe Jones’ original (with a hat tip to The Surfaris at the end).</p>
