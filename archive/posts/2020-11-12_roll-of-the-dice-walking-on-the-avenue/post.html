<p>How prolific was Bruce Springsteen during the period between <a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/07/05/album-companion-darkness-on-the-edge-of-town/"><em>Darkness on the Edge of Town </em></a>and <em>The River</em>?</p>
<p>So prolific that despite requiring a double-album to hold all the songs he chose to release, there were dozens and dozens–and that’s not an exaggeration–that had to be left behind.</p>
<p>Many of the castoffs would eventually see the light of day on <em>Tracks</em> or on the album’s 35th anniversary box set; others remain in the vault still.</p>
<p>And then there are the ones that never made it into the studio at all, like “Walking on the Avenue.” And that’s too bad, because this one certainly had a lot of promise.</p>
<p>Bruce worked on the song acoustically during the first half of 1979, and as we can tell from the two acoustic home demos below, he started as he often did: with the music and a lyrical hook.</p>

<p>The lyrics in both the recording above and below are primitive and very, very bluffed. Don’t spend too much time trying to interpret them.</p>

<p>But the melody is warm, Bruce’s vocals are pure, and if we’re to judge from Bruce’s rhythmic timekeeping guitar-thumping, he probably intended “Walking on the Avenue” to be a melancholy romantic ballad in the style of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/04/28/roll-of-the-dice-fade-away/">Fade Away.</a>” (It’s quite possible, in fact, that “Walking on the Avenue” evolved into “Fade Away” given the chronology of recording.)</p>
<p>Regardless of whether Bruce evolved or abandoned it, however, this is as far as Bruce got with “Walking on the Avenue” (unless he surprises us someday on <em>Tracks 2</em>).</p>
