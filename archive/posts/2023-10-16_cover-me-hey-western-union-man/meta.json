Butler wrote the song with legendary songwriters Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff. (The three also collaborated on &#8220;Only the Strong Survive.&#8221;) They gave the song a Philly soul groove, but its gimmick is the chorus change-up that briefly kicks the song into a staccato rhythm that sounds exactly like the musical equivalent of a Western Union\u00a0 telegram.</p>\n<p>(For the young&#8217;uns: telegrams were Morse code messages transmitted over long distances by electrical impulses in pre-Internet, pre-telephone days (although some 17 million telegrams are still sent annually even today).)</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"High speed morse telegraphy using a straight key\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YPsgEdmlUf0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>The gimmick worked. &#8220;Hey, Western Union Man&#8221; cut through the radio clutter and clawed its way to #16 on the Billboard Hot 100 and all the way to the top of the R&amp;B chart. It was novel and popular enough that both The Supremes and William Bell (both of whom are also represented on\u00a0<em>Only the Strong Survive</em>) covered the song as album tracks in the year or two after the song&#8217;s release.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Diana Ross &amp; The Supremes - Hey, Western Union Man (1969)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pODQ8JnsbxI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Neither cover was released as a single, and &#8220;Hey, Western Union Man&#8221; went largely uncovered after that until Landau introduced it to Springsteen more than fifty years later.</p>\n<p>Bruce&#8217;s cover hews pretty closely to Butler&#8217;s original, preserving the arrangement and taking very few lyrical liberties. It&#8217;s a wise choice: the arrangement is a key ingredient to the song&#8217;s recipe.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Hey, Western Union Man (Official Audio)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/A-Q3NYVr1iM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;Hey, Western Union Man&#8221; converted Springsteen into a Butler fan. He ended up covering not only the two Butler songs that grace his latest album, but (as he told NPR in a December 2022 interview) &#8220;several other of the songs&#8221; from Butler&#8217;s 1968 album,\u00a0<em>The Iceman Cometh</em>.</p>\n<p>Although he gave no specifics, I&#8217;m betting we&#8217;ll hear Butler&#8217;s &#8220;Never Give You Up&#8221; on Bruce&#8217;s rumored follow-up cover album&#8211;hopefully someday soon.</p>\n<p><strong>Hey, Western Union Man<br />\n</strong><strong>Recorded:\u00a02021<br />\nReleased:\u00a0<em>Only the Strong Survive\u00a0</em>(2022)<br />\nNever performed</strong></p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
