meta-description: Bruce’s celebratory “Ghosts” sounds like it was born for a band, but William Goetz of The Big Land Band finds the song’s wistful, nostalgic heart in his beautiful acoustic cover.

It’s tempting to call The Big Land Band a Springsteen tribute band, but that would be too limiting. The Berlin-based rock band includes a healthy dose of Springsteen covers in its sets, but they also cover a range of rock and country artists in takes both faithful and fresh.

Today’s cover certainly falls in the “fresh” category in more ways than one.

“” is one of Bruce’s newest tracks, and from the minute we first hear it performed with the E Street Band, it’s hard to imagine it performed acoustically.

And yet, here comes Big Land Band frontman William Goetz stepping up to the microphone to take a swing at it.

In contrast with Bruce’s celebratory original, Goetz’s cover of “Ghosts” is nostalgic and wistful, and it succeeds brilliantly.

I’m sure we’ll see many more covers over the coming months, but this is a nice way to kick them off.
