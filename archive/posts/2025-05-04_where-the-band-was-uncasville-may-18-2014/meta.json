When he waved his final goodbyes, we all suddenly realized we were looking at a 64-year-old man. I think we all had the same thought: wow, he really is human. How he&#8217;s managed to perform like this for so long is beyond my understanding, but it&#8217;s clear he won&#8217;t be able to do it forever. I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;ll ever be done performing, but I expect future shows to be a bit more human-sized.
