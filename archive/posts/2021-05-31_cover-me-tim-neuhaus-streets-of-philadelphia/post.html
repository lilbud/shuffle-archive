<p>Tim Neuhaus was a drummer for The Blue Man Group and Clueso before evolving into an accomplished indie-pop singer-songwriter with an impressive catalog of albums to his credit.</p>
<p>He’s got one more coming out imminently: <em>Echoes Volume I, </em>an album of covers recorded during lockdown, debuts on June 10th. In advance of the album, Tim released a single of his cover of Bruce Springsteen’s “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/06/30/roll-of-the-dice-streets-of-philadelphia/">Streets of Philadelphia</a>.”</p>

<p>“Streets of Philadelphia” has always lent itself to acoustic arrangements, but Tim’s version (featuring Andi Fins on synth and piano) is particularly lovely, capturing the loneliness, fear, and isolation of Bruce’s narrator through tender performance and intimate video direction.</p>
<p>Look for Tim’s album on June 10th, and in the meantime, check out his other single from the album (a cover of Foo Fighters’ “In Your Honor”) <a href="https://www.facebook.com/timneuhausofficial/">here</a>.</p>
