<p>The Pointer Sisters’ version of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/10/04/roll-of-the-dice-the-fever/">The Fever</a>” has long been one of my favorite Springsteen covers. It’s not that they bring anything new to the table–their arrangement is very close to the original, in fact.</p>
<p>It’s just that they bring so much <em>heat. </em></p>
<p>Check it out in this video (which I only just discovered as I wrote this post–I never knew there was a high-quality video of it until now), and you’ll see what I mean.</p>

<p>She’s got the fever, indeed.</p>
<p>You can find the studio version on The Pointer Sisters’ 1979 studio album, <em>Priority</em>.</p>
