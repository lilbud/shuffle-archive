I apologize.

I know I said last time that I wasn't going to provide any additional Bookshelf Collection updates via the main blog/email feed, but several of you wrote to me requesting that I set up an email list for updates so that you don't have to remember to manually check a buried page on the web site each week.

It's a good idea, one I should have thought of myself.

So yes–you can now sign up for either weekly or monthly **E Street Shuffle Bookshelf Collection** updates by clicking [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc6QS8QQs84TUjNKwQZrsAE-IChg65xM7mAoJ7hwdWRcnamTQ/viewform?usp=header) and filling out the Google form!

Choose *weekly* frequency to receive the latest updates, sneak peaks, behind-the-scenes insights, along with a monthly "now available" announcement with ordering info for that month's new releases.

Choose *monthly* to receive *only* the monthly announcement of new book releases with ordering info.

So that's it. Please sign up if you're interested in the book series. I've already posted a *major* update to the [Bookshelf Collection page](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/the-bookshelf-collection/) on the web site, featuring sneak peaks at the first four volumes, so please check that also if you're so inclined. No more updates here in the main feed, I promise!

Pinky swear.
