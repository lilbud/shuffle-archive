<p>Several weeks back, we took a look at “<a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/03/26/cover-me-boom-boom/">Boom Boom</a>,” the smoking hot John Lee Hooker song that worked its way into Bruce’s set list right around the time he and Patti became a secret item–timing that was probably not coincidental.</p>
<p>But only a few days before, it seemed like Bruce might be on the verge of choosing a different classic Hooker song to add to his set–one that was equally sexy (arguably moreso).</p>
<p>During his Tunnel of Love Express Tour soundcheck in Tacoma on May 6, 1988, Bruce pulled out Hooker’s steamy 1956 crossover hit, “Dimples.”</p>

<p>Was Bruce in a John Lee Hooker mood in the spring of 1988, or was he just feeling his oats? Regardless, his cover, although recorded from a distance, is brassy and cool (once it gets going). It may not switch and sashay like Hooker’s original, but it’s a great arrangement that would have fit nicely in Bruce’s opening set.</p>

<p>Just four days later, though, Bruce would debut cover of “Boom Boom” in Bloomington, Minnesota, and “Dimples” would never be heard from again.</p>
