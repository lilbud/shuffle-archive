Bruce and local DJ Ed Sciaky drop by Philadelphia’s Sigma Sound Studios to meet David Bowie, who is of Bruce’s “.” They don’t get to hear it (it was unfinished), but later that night, Bruce catches Bowie in concert at the Spectrum. After the show ends, there’s enough time for Bruce and Ed to zip back to Center City to catch Billy Joel’s late show at the Academy of Music. Later still, after the show (technically the wee hours of the 26th), Bruce, Billy, and Ed grab some late-night grub at the Eagle II diner. As it turns out, Barry Manilow was in town and had the same idea, so he joins Bruce, Billy, and the Sciakys (Ed’s wife is along for the ride) as well.
