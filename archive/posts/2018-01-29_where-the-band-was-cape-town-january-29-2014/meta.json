Since I&#8217;d never been to Cape Town before (and didn&#8217;t know if I&#8217;d ever make it back), I decided to spend my days seeing the city instead of waiting in the pit line&#8211;so for the first two shows, I wasn&#8217;t anywhere close to the stage.</p>\n<p>But for this last show, I was determined to be up front, so I spent the day making friends in line and got a prime spot leaning on the stage&#8211;and had a great vantage point for moments like this:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - 2014-01-29 - Cape Town Bellville

much greater heights than these opening shows, I&#8217;ll always remember these three among my favorites&#8211;from days spent hiking and exploring with fellow fans to standout performances and
