Bruce wouldn&#8217;t have written that line about &#8220;the whores on 8th Avenue&#8221; anyway.

We don&#8217;t have a recording from that event, unfortunately, but we do have one from two weeks later, at the first-ever show (by anyone) at the Meadowlands.</p>\n<p>Bruce teed it up with the hometown crowd by sharing his observations that Europeans are different than New Jerseyans. (Glad he cleared that up.) Europeans are great, he said, but there&#8217;s &#8220;nobody better&#8221; than a New Jersey crowd. (I&#8217;ll let you decide whether or not that was a pander.) And then, Bruce debuted his own version of Tom Waits&#8217; &#8220;Jersey Girl.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"v-Gx4aArIV-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='426' src='https://videopress.com/embed/Gx4aArIV?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>Fans familiar with Waits&#8217; version probably noticed that Bruce cleaned up the lyrics a bit, but the shocker was the completely new final verse:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I see you on the street and you look so tired</em><br />\n<em>Girl I know that job you got leaves you so uninspired</em><br />\n<em>When I come by to take you out to eat</em><br />\n<em>You&#8217;re lying all dressed up on the bed baby fast asleep</em><br />\n<em>Go in the bathroom, put your makeup on</em><br />\n<em>We&#8217;re gonna take that little brat of yours and drop her off at your mom&#8217;s</em><br />\n<em>I know a place where the dancing&#8217;s free</em><br />\n<em>Now baby won&#8217;t you come with me</em></p>\n<p>That verse perfectly matches the tone and heart of Waits&#8217; original&#8211;in large part because Waits&#8217; songwriting on &#8220;Jersey Girl&#8221; so closely resembles Bruce&#8217;s own style.</p>\n<p>In any event, while it wasn&#8217;t the first time Bruce wrote new lyrics for a song while covering it (he&#8217;d done it just a few months earlier with &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/08/05/roll-of-the-dice-cover-me-trapped/\">Trapped</a>&#8220;), and while it certainly wouldn&#8217;t be the last, it may very well be the most natural graft he&#8217;s ever made.</p>\n<p>(None of us would realize it for more than three decades, but as it turns out, Bruce had those lyrics in his pocket already&#8211;he&#8217;d written them for &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/11/14/roll-of-the-dice-party-lights/\">Party Lights</a>,&#8221; recorded during the River sessions but locked away in the vault until it was released with\u00a0<em>The Ties That Bind</em> box set in 2015.)</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Party Lights (The River: Outtakes) [Lyric]\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/S2WWQAvS_6I?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Exactly one week later, at the final show of that opening Meadowlands stand and after another practice performance on the 5th, Bruce recorded his performance of &#8220;Jersey Girl&#8221; for posterity. That rendition is the one we&#8217;re all most familiar with&#8211;it was released as the B-side to the single for &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/01/13/roll-of-the-dice-cover-me/\">Cover Me</a>&#8221; in 1984 and included on\u00a0<em>Live 1975-85</em> two years after that.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a magnificent performance&#8211;one of Bruce&#8217;s very best and certainly one of his most passionate.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Jersey Girl (Live at Meadowlands Arena, E.

That honor would have to go to (ironically) a Los Angeles performance from later that summer, where Bruce introduced the song by remarking:</p>\n<p><em>There&#8217;s a guy that&#8217;s written a lot of great songs, like &#8220;Ol&#8217; 55,&#8221; &#8220;Heart of Saturday Night&#8230;&#8221; and this song. When I heard it, I remember it was one of those songs I said, &#8220;Well&#8230; I wish I&#8217;d wrote that.&#8221; It&#8217;s a song called &#8220;Jersey Girl&#8221; and Tom Waits is gonna sing it with us.<br />\n</em></p>\n<p>And then, as promised, Tom Waits joined Bruce on stage for their one and only public duet of &#8220;Jersey Girl.&#8221; (They&#8217;d perform it once more in 1990 at a private reception.) Take a listen below&#8211;and notice how it&#8217;s an unusual, one-off hybrid version: Tom sings Bruce&#8217;s sanitized first verse but adds his &#8220;And I call your name; I can&#8217;t sleep at night&#8221; flourish that Bruce dropped, while Bruce sings the verse he added.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Tom and Bruce - Jersey Girl - Full Version - 1981\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1MXX0Y81eDI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Almost immediately, &#8220;Jersey Girl&#8221; became a tri-state area favorite. Bruce has performed it dozens of times since the River Tour, but only four times outside of NJ, PA, and NY.</p>\n<p>The real winning lottery tickets, though, were held by the few fans who were lucky enough to catch Bruce playing it on a summer night at the Jersey Shore. Here&#8217;s one of the earliest of those performances: Bruce with Cats on a Smooth Surface at The Stone Pony on August 15, 1982&#8211;remarkably captured and preserved on video.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - JERSEY GIRL  1982\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ebby_aGMwZQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>As the years passed, &#8220;Jersey Girl&#8221; became less of a trusty tri-state standard and more of a special occasion marker.
