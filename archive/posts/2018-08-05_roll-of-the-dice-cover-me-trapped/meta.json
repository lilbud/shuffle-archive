It was clearly a protest song, but it could be read as either a personal or political one. Cliff probably intended it that way, and that&#8217;s undoubtedly part of what drew Bruce to it.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Well it seems like I&#8217;ve fallen in your trap again</em><br />\n<em>And it seems like I&#8217;ll be wearing the same old pain</em><br />\n<em>But good must conquer evil and truth will set me free</em><br />\n<em>So you see that somewhere I have found the key</em><br />\n<em>Yes you see that somewhere I have found the key</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Well it seems like I&#8217;ve been sleeping in your bed too long</em><br />\n<em>And it seems like you&#8217;ve been planning to do me wrong</em><br />\n<em>But evil concentrated must be disintegrated</em><br />\n<em>So I know that I&#8217;ll be walking out again</em><br />\n<em>Yes I know that I&#8217;ll be walking out again</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Well it seems like I have played the game your way too long</em><br />\n<em>And it seems the game I&#8217;ve played has made you strong</em><br />\n<em>But when this game is over, I won&#8217;t end up the loser</em><br />\n<em>And I know that I&#8217;ll be walking out again</em><br />\n<em>Yes I know that I&#8217;ll be walking out again</em></p>\n<p>Notice that In Jimmy&#8217;s original, the protagonist has already found his means of escape:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>So you see that somewhere I have found the key</em><br />\n<em>Yes you see that somewhere I have found the key</em></p>\n<p>But in Bruce&#8217;s version, while still optimistic, the hero is still very much trapped:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>And I know someday I&#8217;ll find the key</em><br />\n<em>And I know somewhere I will find the key</em></p>\n<p>Bruce also changed the line &#8220;evil concentrated must be disintegrated&#8221; to &#8220;I&#8217;ll teach my eyes to seen beyond these walls in front of me,&#8221; again shifting the song&#8217;s message from one of imminent escape to still-very-much-stuck.</p>\n<p>Combined with the slow build and powerful, explosive chorus, Bruce&#8217;s &#8220;Trapped&#8221; conveys a blend of seething anger and obstinate determination missing from the more optimistic original.</p>\n<p>Bruce debuted the song at the opening show of a six-night stand at Wembley Arena in London. Bruce was carrying some personal baggage from previous shows there, and debuting an obscure cover in a new, untried arrangement was a bold move&#8211;but it worked, fabulously so. Here&#8217;s that debut performance, from <a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/05/29/kingdom-of-days-may-29/\">May 29</a>, 1981:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - live debut of &quot;Trapped&quot; - 1981-05-29\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RpGVwh0NkY4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;Trapped&#8221; remained in the set throughout the rest of the tour and was a prominent staple of the Born in the USA Tour as well, and World Tour 1992-93, the Reunion Tour&#8230; in fact, it&#8217;s easier to list the tours it\u00a0<em>hasn&#8217;t\u00a0</em>been played at (Tunnel of Love, the acoustic tours, and Seeger Sessions are the notable exceptions).</p>\n<p>When Bruce performed the song at the Meadowlands on the BITUSA Tour, the performance was recorded and released on the benefit album\u00a0<em>We Are the World,\u00a0</em>rising all the way to the top of the Billboard Rock chart despite never being released as a single.
