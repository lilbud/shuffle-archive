<p>The Chantays were a one-hit wonder, but their one hit was monumental.</p>
<p>Written by band members and guitarists Brian Carman and Bob Spickard and recorded in 1962, “Pipeline” became an instant hit, peaking at #4 on the Billboard Pop chart and cementing a place as one of the most important surf rock songs.</p>
<p>So popular was “Pipeline” in 1963 that The Chantays became the first and only rock band to ever perform on The Lawrence Welk show.</p>

<p>As far as we know, Bruce has never covered “Pipeline” in concert or in public, but he did play it at least once in private–at a rehearsal session with the E Street Band on February 22, 1980 at Bruce’s home studio.</p>

<p>Did I say rehearsal? If that was a rehearsal, imagine what a concert performance would have been like.</p>
<p>I’m not often one to proclaim a cover to be stronger than the original (especially for an acknowledged classic), but Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band absolutely owned “Pipeline” in this brief performance–the only time they are known to have played this surf rock landmark.</p>
