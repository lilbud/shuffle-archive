Bruce plays a very special acoustic show at a very special venue: his old elementary school, St. Rose of Lima. This isn’t his first time playing the school gym (that was back in his Castiles days), but it’s his first time back since then. Although this show is technically part of the Ghost of Tom Joad Tour, in reality it’s a very different performance. First of all, he isn’t solo: Patti and Soozie join him on several numbers. Secondly, the setlist is different, with tour premieres. Bruce opens with a gorgeous, Soozie-accompanied “” and closes with a world debut: “,” which Bruce wrote for the occasion. In between, there’s gem after gem: “” and “” with Soozie and Patti, “” and “” solo, an absolutely stunning “” with Soozie, and more. Check out the clips below, and then buy the official archive series release .
