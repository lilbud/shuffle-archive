We were first introduced to James Taylor's "Millworker" through Robin Lamont, who sang it in the Stephen Schwartz 1978 musical *Working,* for which Taylor wrote the song.

Taylor recorded his own version and released it the following year on his *Flag* album. It quickly became a fan favorite, covered by everyone from Bette Midler to Emmylou Harris to Eddie Vedder.

And in 2006, Bruce took a run at it, too. At the annual MusiCares benefit in Los Angeles, Taylor was honored as "Person of the Year," and in addition to the scheduled performers that night, Bruce made a surprise appearance.

Perhaps the lack of a proper introduction threw him a bit, because he didn't seem to quite know how to set up the song. But after a somewhat awkward introduction, Bruce turned in a memorable performance of "Millworker," true to its narrator's life of hardship.

That was a one-time-only performance–but just a couple months later, Bruce would release [*We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions*](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/07/17/album-companion-we-shall-overcome/) and embark on a too-brief tour featuring a set list full of songs honoring good people who had to work too hard just to survive.

"Millworker" was a fitting prologue for the year.
