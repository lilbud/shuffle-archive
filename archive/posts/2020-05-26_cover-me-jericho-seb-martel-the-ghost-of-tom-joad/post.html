<p>Wow.</p>
<p>There’s an absolute flood of Springsteen covers being released by artists during the global shutdown, and while I try to watch them all, it’s tough to find the time or the quiet to pay full attention.</p>
<p>But when I came across this cover of “<a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/10/17/roll-of-the-dice-the-ghost-of-tom-joad/">The Ghost of Tom Joad</a>” by French singer-songwriter Jericho with Seb Martel on lap steel, I found myself unable to look away.</p>
<p>This may be the single most impassioned performance (in acoustic form, at least) I’ve ever heard of Bruce’s oft-covered song.</p>

<p>Jericho’s cover is intended to raise awareness for relief efforts in Montreuil, a Parisian suburb. There’s no link in the video for donations, though, just instructions for locals who want to help.</p>
<p>So if you’re moved by his outstanding cover and want to help but aren’t local, perhaps find an organization working to help struggling families in our own communities.</p>
<p>Stay healthy, and stay safe.</p>
