Anyone who knows &#8216;Two Hearts&#8217; might even be shocked at how romantic the song really is when the musical environment is altered.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Billy Mann-Two hearts\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/UXs4tt82-7Y?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Altered it is&#8211;as Mann put it, he turned the song &#8220;from a rager to a recliner.&#8221; And a beautiful recliner it is.</p>\n<p>For some reason, though, Billy&#8217;s beautiful version of &#8220;Two Hearts&#8221; didn&#8217;t make the album&#8211;but it was released on an EP of album outtakes called\u00a0<em>Downbound Train. </em>That&#8217;s about as undeservedly obscure as you can get: an outtake from a tribute album.</p>\n<p>Mann&#8217;s &#8220;Two Hearts&#8221; cover deserves far more attention than that.
