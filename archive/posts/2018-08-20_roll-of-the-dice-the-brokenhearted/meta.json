But every once in a while, the dice assign me a relative obscurity and I&#8217;m on my own.</p>\n<p>But one listen to &#8220;The Brokenhearted&#8221; tells you pretty much everything you need to know. If Roy Orbison fronting The Drifters doesn&#8217;t come immediately to mind, you weren&#8217;t paying close attention.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The Brokenhearted&#8221; is a gorgeous torch song and almost certainly an homage to two of Bruce&#8217;s influences: his soaring vocals are clearly mimicking Orbison&#8217;s style, and the mariachi melody (complete with horns) are evocative of &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/01/23/cover-me-spanish-harlem/\">Spanish Harlem,</a>&#8220;which Bruce had performed in concert a few years earlier.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"The Brokenhearted\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YvilYiGDmoM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>So figuring out what Bruce was going for was the easy part. The hard part is untangling its convoluted history.</p>\n<p>The historical record indicates that Bruce first recorded &#8220;The Brokenhearted&#8221; on November 29, 1977 during the\u00a0<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/07/05/album-companion-darkness-on-the-edge-of-town/\"><em>Darkness on the Edge of Town</em></a> sessions. That original recording has never surfaced.</p>\n<p>The audio above comes from Bruce&#8217;s 2010 double album,\u00a0<em>The Promise,\u00a0</em>which is sort of an alternate-universe\u00a0<em>Darkness on the Edge of Town,</em> comprised entirely of unreleased outtakes from those sessions.</p>\n<p>However, the song clearly had some modern work done on it, from the subtle overlay of a horn section to the jarring modern vocals in the coda. Bruce&#8217;s 2010 voice is markedly more gruff than his 1977 voice, and the abrupt switchover from Orbison croon to Springsteen growl\u00a0 is unnerving&#8211;it always takes me out of the song.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also hard to know if Bruce edited the song or changed the lyrics when he replaced the ending vocals, because we actually do have a single contemporary artifact for comparison: Bruce and the E Street Band played the song during a rehearsal session in Asbury Park on May 19, 1978. But oddly, the lyrics don&#8217;t match up\u00a0<em>at all</em> with the released version&#8211;in fact, most of them sound bluffed. That&#8217;s strange, considering the vocal that we listen to today was recorded months prior&#8211;so perhaps Bruce hadn&#8217;t planned to play it that day and couldn&#8217;t remember the lyrics, or perhaps he worked on the song subsequently during sessions that haven&#8217;t been documented. Regardless, it&#8217;s an unexplained one-off that&#8217;s still worth listening to&#8211;especially to hear what the coda\u00a0<em>should</em> have sounded like:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - &quot;The Brokenhearted&quot; tour rehearsal 5/19/78\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6Z1orxaa5Nw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Ah, what I&#8217;d give to hear that original tape. But for now at least, we&#8217;ll have to stick with the George Lucas special edition.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Well darling, oh won&#8217;t you come a little closer</em><br />\n<em>I promise pretty darling, I didn&#8217;t know what I was saying</em><br />\n<em>And now I&#8217;m praying that you won&#8217;t say it&#8217;s over</em><br />\n<em>Come here pretty baby and rest your head upon my shoulder</em><br />\n<em>Just one kiss and we started</em><br />\n<em>Now don&#8217;t leave me to the brokenhearted, the brokenhearted, the brokenhearted</em><br />\n<em>And tell me that you need me</em></p>\n<p>Lyrically, &#8220;The Brokenhearted&#8221; is well-trod Springsteenian territory: from classics like &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/04/28/roll-of-the-dice-fade-away/\">Fade Away</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/11/10/roll-of-the-dice-back-in-your-arms/\">Back in Your Arms</a>&#8221; to unreleased outtakes like &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/03/29/roll-of-the-dice-baby-come-back/\">Baby Come Back</a>,&#8221; this is an &#8220;I done you wrong baby, I&#8217;m down on my knees baby, please take me back baby&#8221; song&#8211;and it&#8217;s clear from the first verse that this time at least, it was the protagonist&#8217;s big mouth that put him in the doghouse, rather than his actions.</p>\n<p>The singer is relatively even-keeled here, using plain language unadorned of any metaphor, conveying that he doesn&#8217;t yet realize how much deep water he&#8217;s in. Bruce establishes a neat device, adding a stem to the chorus (&#8220;and tell me that you need me&#8221;) that will grow with each chorus, signifying the singer&#8217;s increasing desperation.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Well now baby, the lonely nights keep growing longer</em><br />\n<em>And my love for you just keeps growing stronger</em><br />\n<em>Like a wheel of chance so endlessly turning</em><br />\n<em>My fate lay in your hands, my heart forever burning</em><br />\n<em>In a sweet fire your kiss started</em><br />\n<em>Now don&#8217;t leave me to the brokenhearted, the brokenhearted, the brokenhearted</em><br />\n<em>And tell me that you love me</em><br />\n<em>Tell me that you want me, girl</em></p>\n<p>See how Bruce introduces metaphor here? The wheel of chance, the burning heart, the sweet fire of his love&#8217;s kiss&#8211;he&#8217;s getting a bit worked up now, and the double-stemmed chorus launches into an apology bridge:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>The cruel mistakes I&#8217;ve made, the hard price that I&#8217;ve paid</em><br />\n<em>For the good times and for laughter</em><br />\n<em>Girl, I should&#8217;ve known for the indifference that I&#8217;ve shown</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;d pay forever after</em></p>\n<p>Now Bruce brings it home, begging her to recognize that he&#8217;s aware of his mistakes and owning up to them&#8211;hoping against hope that she wants to give him another chance.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>And darling, now all I&#8217;m trying to say is passion</em><br />\n<em>And love, they have a way of slipping into blackness</em><br />\n<em>Uncared for of slipping away</em><br />\n<em>The deck is cut, the cards turned, the hand is played</em><br />\n<em>And all we ever hope for burns to ashes and drifts away</em><br />\n<em>Now don&#8217;t let our love slip into this darkness</em><br />\n<em>Don&#8217;t leave me to the brokenhearted, the brokenhearted, the brokenhearted</em><br />\n<em>And tell me that you love me</em><br />\n<em>Tell me that you need me</em><br />\n<em>Tell me that you love me</em><br />\n<em>Tell me that you want me</em><br />\n<em>Tell me that you need me</em><br />\n<em>Tell me that you want me</em><br />\n<em>Tell me that you love me</em><br />\n<em>Yeah tell me that you love me</em><br />\n<em>Tell me that you love me</em><br />\n<em>Tell me that you want me</em><br />\n<em>And come on now daring</em><br />\n<em>Say it right now baby</em><br />\n<em>Say it right now darling</em><br />\n<em>Tell me that you love me</em></p>\n<p>That extended coda <em>makes</em> the song, fading to black on Bruce&#8217;s incessant but fruitless pleading.\u00a0 Which is why it maddens me that Bruce tinkered with it before releasing it on\u00a0<em>The Promise.\u00a0</em>What should be tragic tale of an indifferent lover gone one step too far suddenly feels like a brand new singer takes over the song.</p>\n<p>Also: scroll back up and listen to the coda in the rehearsal version again. In that version, Bruce cries over and over again: &#8220;Baby it hurts!&#8221; &#8212; a much more pathetic outro. It strikes me as odd that Bruce would mis-remember that part while performing it (even in rehearsal), which makes me strongly suspect that the reason Bruce replaced the coda vocals wasn&#8217;t because they didn&#8217;t exist, or due to some flaw in the recording&#8211;I think he just didn&#8217;t like the way the narrator came across as pathetic rather than desperate.</p>\n<p>I actually don&#8217;t take issue with that assessment&#8211;in fact, I agree with it. The modern coda is much better lyrically. I just don&#8217;t think the trade-off was worth it. It&#8217;s the Springsteen equivalent of &#8220;Han shot first&#8221; &#8212; it may be more in keeping with the author&#8217;s notion of the character, but it&#8217;s awfully distracting every time we encounter that moment.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s hard to know how Bruce ultimately feels about &#8220;The Brokenhearted,&#8221; because so far, he&#8217;s only played it once in concert, during a promotional show in 2010 for the release of\u00a0<em>The Promise.\u00a0</em>It&#8217;s on my chase list, though&#8211;I&#8217;d love to hear it performed intact.</p>\n<p><strong>The Brokenhearted</strong><br />\n<strong>Recorded:</strong> November 29, 1977 (plus additional work in 2010)<br />\n<strong>Released:\u00a0</strong><em>The Promise</em> (2010)<br />\n<strong>First performed:</strong> December 7, 2010 (Asbury Park, NJ)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> December 7, 2010 (Asbury Park, NJ)</p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
