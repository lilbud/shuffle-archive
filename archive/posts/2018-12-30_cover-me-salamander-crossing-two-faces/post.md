I'm a sucker for obscure Bruce covers and unusual arrangements; Salamander Crossing checked both boxes with their bluegrass rendition of "[Two Faces](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/05/26/roll-of-the-dice-two-faces/)" on their 1996 album *Passion Train.*

The band isn't around anymore, but their career retrospective album (which includes "Two Faces") is still in print.
