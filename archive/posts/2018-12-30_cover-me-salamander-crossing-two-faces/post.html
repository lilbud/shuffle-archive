<p>I’m a sucker for obscure Bruce covers and unusual arrangements; Salamander Crossing checked both boxes with their bluegrass rendition of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/05/26/roll-of-the-dice-two-faces/">Two Faces</a>” on their 1996 album <em>Passion Train.</em></p>
<p>The band isn’t around anymore, but their career retrospective album (which includes “Two Faces”) is still in print.</p>
