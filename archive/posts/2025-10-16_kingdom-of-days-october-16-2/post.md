**1974:** Bruce holds a recording session for his upcoming third album at 914 Sound Studios in Blauvelt, New York.

**1975:** Bruce and the E Street Band kick off a four-night/six-show stand at The Roxy Theater in West Hollywood. Thanks to Columbia Records (but unknown to Bruce), the audience is filled with industry insiders and media, resulting in a quieter-than-usual audience and at least one underwhelmed critic. Among the notables in the audience: Jackson Browne, Neil Diamond, Jim Messina, Jack Nicholson, Peter Boyle, Robert De Niro, and Carole King, to whom Bruce dedicates his debut of her song, “[Goin’ Back](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/02/07/cover-me-goin-back/).” It’s speculated that De Niro swiped Bruce’s “you talking to *me?*” routine performed at this show for his part in *Taxi Driver.*

**1980:** In town for a River Tour show the next night, Bruce goes out driving and ends up in a movie theater, where he catches the new Woody Allen movie, *Stardust Memories.* A fan notices him, strikes up a conversation, and invites him over to his house for dinner. And this is how Bruce meets the Satanovksys and the now famous “Miss Sophie.”

**1985:** Steve Van Zandt releases “Sun City,” a single by Artists United Against Apartheid in protest of the South African policy, publicly and collectively declaring a boycott of the controversial resort. Bruce is one of the many, many artists appearing in the song.
