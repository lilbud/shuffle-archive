<p>And cuts don’t get much deeper than “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/02/07/roll-of-the-dice-wages-of-sin/">Wages of Sin</a>,” Bruce’s haunting <em>Born in the U.S.A. </em>outtake that finally saw official release in 1998.</p>
<p>There aren’t many covers of this song out there. In fact, I only know of one: this gorgeous version by Seattle singer-songwriter Damien Jurado and Rosie Thomas.</p>

<p>Heck, even the cover is a deep cut: it’s a bonus track on a <i>Nebraska </i>tribute compilation released by Sub Pop at the turn of the century. (Yeah, I know the original was recorded post-<em>Nebraska</em>, but Bruce wrote and demoed it during his <em>Nebraska</em> period, so we can give it a pass.)</p>
<p>I’ve always thought that “Wages of Sin” felt like a dance between two wary lovers, circling each other across a widening gulf of emotional distance and distrust.  Damien and Rosie’s duet dials directly into that sentiment, their interwoven vocals drawing us into their heartache more potently than a single voice can accomplish, even when that voice is Bruce’s.</p>
<p>It’s a beautiful cover of a undeservedly overlooked song.</p>
