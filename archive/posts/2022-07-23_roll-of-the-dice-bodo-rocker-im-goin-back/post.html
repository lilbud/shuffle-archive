<p>Play this one <em>loud!</em></p>
<p>You still won’t be able to make out much of the lyrics, but who cares? When you’ve got a song called “BoDo Rocker” (short for “Bo Diddley Rocker”), you already know it’s not about the words anyway.</p>
<p>It’s about the beat.</p>

<p>Bootleggers called it “I’m Goin’ Back” since it’s the obvious chorus, but “BoDo Rocker” (as it’s called in the studio session logs) is a more apt title. This five-and-a-half-minute rave-up is even more of an homage to Bo Diddley than Bruce’s previous two tributes, “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/07/01/roll-of-the-dice-preachers-daughter/">Preacher’s Daughter</a>” and “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/04/04/roll-of-the-dice-shes-the-one/">She’s the One</a>.”</p>
<p>Bruce starts us off with a wailing harmonica intro, but from the moment the band enters at the five-second mark, “BoDo Rocker” is a freight train that cannot be stopped.</p>
<p>I’ve seen several attempts to transcribe the lyrics; I’m convinced all of them are way off. But since the vocals are buried so far in the mix, I’m not going to be of much help either. Like I said, though: the lyrics aren’t the point, because if you’re paying attention to the lyrics you’re missing out on the E Street Band at their Darkness-era peak.</p>
<p>Bruce calls on every member of the band to keep that train barreling down the tracks. The Professor is all over his keys, Max is a veritable machine, The Big Man is on another plane, and Bruce–when he isn’t turning in one of his finest studio harmonica performances–sings like a man possessed. (I love his evil laugh when the song comes to a crashing halt.)</p>
<p>Recorded in late 1977, “BoDo Rocker” never had a prayer of making it onto <a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/07/05/album-companion-darkness-on-the-edge-of-town/"><em>Darkness on the Edge of Town</em></a>. It would have steamrolled over all the carefully crafted tracks on that classic album.</p>
<p>But I’d consider paying platinum prices to see them play it live on the next tour.</p>
