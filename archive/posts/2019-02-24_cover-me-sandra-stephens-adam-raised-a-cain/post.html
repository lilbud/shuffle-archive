<p>Stop what you’re doing and listen to Sandra Stephens’ remarkable cover of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/07/03/roll-of-the-dice-adam-raised-a-cain/">Adam Raised a Cain</a>.” If you haven’t heard it before, you’ve never heard it performed like this before.</p>

<p>Prior to her collaborations with Lanny Cordola, she was known primarily for her gospel and religious recordings. But through her collaborations with Cordolla, she branched out, lending her remarkable vocals to a spectrum of musical styles, including rock and roll.</p>
<p>When Cordola was producing <em>Made in the U.S.A.</em>, a tribute album to Bruce (see Cordola’s remarkable cover of “<a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/12/09/cover-me-lanny-cordola-my-beautiful-reward/">My Beautiful Reward</a>” from that album), he brought in Stephens for a smoky, simmering “Adam Raised a Cain” that’s less the angry lookback of Bruce’s original and more a foreboding warning of what lies ahead for Cain.</p>
<p>Special mention is due to Ron King’s atmospheric trumpet contribution, but really, the entire arrangement and performance is just wonderful. This easily ranks among my favorite Springsteen covers.</p>
