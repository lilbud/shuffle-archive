(We&#8217;ll take a listen to that track sometime in the next year.)\u00a0But the undeservedly overlooked final track merits some love, too.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a Thousand Miles From Home&#8221; is everything &#8220;All Just to Get to You&#8221; isn&#8217;t: slow, simple, meditative, and world-weary.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"758\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VJtl9sC8_KA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></div>\n<p>It also features some <em>very </em>Springsteenian lyrics:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Travelin&#8217; down this weary road</em><br />\n<em>A troubled mind is a heavy load</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Hold my ticket in my hand</em><br />\n<em>Lookin&#8217; for the Promised Land</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I&#8217;m a thousand miles from home</em></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s pretty easy to see why Bruce would be attracted to a song like this. Bruce&#8217;s impassioned backing vocals are clear in the mix, and his voice blends well with Ely&#8217;s. (Bruce tends to take the high harmonies when backing other artists.)</p>\n<p>Unlike &#8220;All Just to Get to You,&#8221; which Bruce has performed with Ely seven times in concert, Bruce has yet to perform &#8220;I&#8217;m a Thousand Miles From Home.&#8221; But that&#8217;s okay: this is a delicately crafted studio track that&#8217;s perfect in its original form.</p>\n<p><strong>I&#8217;m a
