Gang-related? A planned murder? We never learn; the only certainty is that the narrator&#8217;s love was an innocent bystander, killed by the stray bullet.</p>\n<p>The minute-and-a-half instrumental coda dwells on the memory through Roy Bittan&#8217;s questioning, understated piano, and then moves onward with Bruce&#8217;s guitar and Clarence&#8217;s saxophone to a gentle fade.</p>\n<p>Bruce has never performed &#8220;Stray Bullet&#8221; in concert, and it&#8217;s unclear whether it would translate well to a concert setting. It remains a beautiful, haunting and haunted orphan in his expansive catalog.</p>\n<p><strong>Stray Bullet<br />\nRecorded:\u00a0</strong>February 24, March 9, and April 10, 1980 (it&#8217;s unclear from which session this take originates)<br />\n<strong>Released</strong>: <em>The River: Outtakes\u00a0</em>(2015)<br />\n<strong>Never Performed</strong></p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
