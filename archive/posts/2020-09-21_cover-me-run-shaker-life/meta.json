It became one of the most covered and recorded Shaker songs, enduring and evolving as the years passed.</p>\n<p>In 1968, Richie Havens adapted and recorded it as &#8220;Run, Shaker Life,&#8221; the final track of his <em>Something Else Again</em> album, reuniting his former band The Last Men for the occasion.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Richie Havens - Run, Shaker Life (1968)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5O_R3wCmq34?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Something Else Again</em> became Havens&#8217; first album to chart, and if he wasn&#8217;t on Bruce Springsteen&#8217;s radar before then, he certainly was now.</p>\n<p>Barely a year later, Bruce was not only performing &#8220;Run, Shaker Life&#8221; with Steel Mill, it quickly became a standard encore (often the final one) for the band throughout the remainder of their run.</p>\n<p>At almost six minutes long on the album, Havens&#8217; &#8220;Run, Shaker Life&#8221; was already a jam number, but Steel Mill never met a song they couldn&#8217;t stretch into an even more extended showcase for lengthy solos and jams.</p>\n<p>The religious theme of &#8220;Run, Shaker Life&#8221; also gave Bruce an early chance to hone his rock and roll preacher shtick. Take a listen to the clip below (recorded at one of the very last Steel Mill shows) and in the last couple of minutes, you&#8217;ll clearly hear the early stages of the on-stage patter style Bruce would employ many years later.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen and Steel Mill: Run Shaker Life 1971 01 18, D&#039;Scene, South Amboy, NJ\"
