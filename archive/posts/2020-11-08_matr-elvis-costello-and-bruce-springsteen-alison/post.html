<blockquote><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">“I’ve always told people that I wrote the song ‘Alison’ after seeing a beautiful checkout girl at the local supermarket. She had a face for which a ship might have once been named. Scoundrels might once have fought mist-swathed duels to defend her honour. Now she was punching in the prices on cans of beans at a cash register and looking as if all the hopes and dreams of her youth were draining away.” — Elvis Costello, <em>Unfaithful Music &amp; Disappearing Ink</em></span></p></blockquote>
<p>With apologies to Bruce: the true Queen of the Supermarket belongs to Elvis.</p>
<p>Elvis Costello released “Alison” as the second single from his very first album in 1977. The tender ballad never made the charts, but it became a signature song for Elvis and one of his most beloved.</p>

<p>In the winter of 2001, Bruce reprised his successful Asbury Park benefit holiday shows from the previous year, expanding them from a pair to a string of five shows over the course of a week. Every show featured a set list full of holiday classics, Springsteen chestnuts, and eclectic surprises.</p>
<p>The run culminated in a star-studded final show that featured appearances by Bruce Hornsby and Elvis Costello in addition to the “regular” cast over the course of the week.</p>
<p>Elvis only joined Bruce for two brief numbers, one of which was a cover. The other one, however, was “Alison,” and Costello’s lovely acoustic rendition–with Bruce on backing vocals–was one of the highlights of the night.</p>

<p>(Apologies for the abrupt ending; Elvis segued into “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/10/16/matr-soul-asylum-and-bruce-springsteen-the-tracks-of-my-tears/">The Tracks of My Tears</a>” from there.)</p>
<p>Despite a few additional appearances together (most notably on Elvis’ late, lamented <em>Spectacle</em> series), this was the only time Bruce has ever performed “Alison” live.</p>
