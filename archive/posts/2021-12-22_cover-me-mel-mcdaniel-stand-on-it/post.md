In 1986, Bruce Springsteen was still surfing a wave of super-stardom on the heels of the massive success that was 

*Born in the U.S.A.*

One might think that eighteen months after the release of the album and a few months after the end of his record-breaking tour, popular attention might have been ready to move on. Yet, Bruce still managed to score two Top Ten singles in 1986: “” which peaked at #6 in the early weeks of the year, and “,” which notched a #9 berth at the tail end of it.

McDaniel tended to go against the grain of country music tropes, eschewing tales of broken hearts and sorrows in favor of upbeat happy songs. “Stand On It” fit the bill nicely.

Already a rockabilly song in its original arrangement, it was easy for McDaniel to adapt, and he took it all the way to #12 on the Hot Country Singles chart in the U.S. and to #5 in Canada.

The song’s popularity earned McDaniel an array of television performances, including this live appearance on .

“Stand On It” remained a fan favorite for the rest of McDaniel’s career, which unfortunately ended abruptly, tragically, and prematurely in 1996 when he fell into the pit while performing and nearly died. McDaniel played “Stand On It” as a reliable encore right up until the end.
