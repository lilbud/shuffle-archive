<p>There’s a point in every tour where Bruce loosens up, throws the setlist out the window, and transforms the entire concert into a non-stop, unpredictable jet engine of a show.</p>
<p>On the River Tour (2016 edition), I expected it to happen in Philly, but I was wrong. I thought for sure it would happen in Los Angeles, but despite a high-octane three-night stand, those shows were still tightly scripted. I knew it wouldn’t happen in Portland. And after the short (by Bruce’s standards) and predictable show in Portland two days prior<span class="text_exposed_show">, I really wasn’t expecting much out of Seattle. And going into the show, I was at peace with that.</span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">At the time, I’d planned for the Seattle show to be my last of the tour (the extension legs hadn’t yet been announced). Since Seattle is my adopted home town, I opted for a suite at KeyArena, where I could enjoy the show in comfort with great friends, and all I really wanted was one last chance to take in those gorgeous River songs.</span></p>
<p>(Sharing a pro tip: I’m sure mileage varies, but at many arenas (KeyArena included), the per-person cost for a suite is surprisingly only a small premium above the price of a standard ticket. When I can pull together a group of 16, I often throw in for a suite. It’s certainly not the high-adrenaline pit experience, but the view is excellent and unobstructed, the seating is comfy, and it’s nice to have a private bar and restroom.)</p>

<p>So I was completely unprepared for what I witnessed that night: a 3 hour and 45 minute barnburner featuring a second set comprised almost *entirely* of sign requests (Bruce had hardly done any up until this point on the tour, and none for the previous 5 shows before Seattle); a “<a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/06/19/roll-of-the-dice-bobby-jean/">Bobby Jean</a>” guest-spot by Eddie Vedder; lots of ad-libbed and improvised takes on tour standards (including a hilarious almost-train-wreck during “<a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/02/02/roll-of-the-dice-crush-on-you/">Crush on You</a>” that seemed to be the inflection point of the show but sadly wasn’t captured on youtube), a first-time-for-me performance of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/06/05/roll-of-the-dice-im-goin-down/">I’m Goin’ Down</a>,” a stunning duet of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/08/08/roll-of-the-dice-tougher-than-the-rest/">Tougher Than the Rest</a>,” and a final “<a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/09/12/cover-me-shout/">Shout</a>” that seemed like it would never end.</p>
<p>It was, by far, the best show of the tour to date (IMO), in the place I least expected to find it. This was my ninth show of tour, and I thought it would be last… but after that show, I just couldn’t stop.</p>
<p>I had to do one more.</p>
<p>Or maybe seven.</p>
