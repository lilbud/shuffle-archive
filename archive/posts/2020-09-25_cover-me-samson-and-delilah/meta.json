While on the surface, &#8220;If I Had My Way&#8221; is the biblical tale of Samson and Delilah, the use of that well-known tale is almost certainly a veneer: the narrator sings of Samson, a powerful man who was betrayed and enslaved; the &#8220;building&#8221; the narrator longs to tear down is the institution of slavery itself.</p>\n<p>In the 1950s, the Reverend Gary Davis recorded the song, keeping it alive into the latter half of the twentieth century and inspiring popular covers by both Peter, Paul, and Mary and The Grateful Dead.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Samson And Delilah\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oW5hvQmHLdY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Peter Paul &amp; Mary - If I Had My Way\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TY-699M7j3g?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Grateful Dead - Samson and Delilah (Winterland 12/31/78) (Official Live Video)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RMwTK6IgXUo?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>But despite the popularity of the latter two versions, it was likely Davis&#8217; arrangement that most directly inspired Bruce Springsteen&#8217;s one-time-only cover of &#8220;Samson and Delilah&#8221; with the Sessions Band in Verona.</p>\n<p>Bruce&#8217;s cover was just one of many folk and spiritual standards reinvented for his too-brief 2006 tour, but with only a single far-from-home outing, it&#8217;s the one his fans are least likely to have heard.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s too bad&#8211;because it&#8217;s a fantastic performance.
