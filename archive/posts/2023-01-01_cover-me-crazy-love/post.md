Early in the Tunnel of Love Express Tour, Bruce was in a Van Morrison state of mind. Although they never made the setlist, he often soundchecked Morrison’s songs. On one night, in fact, he soundchecked “,” “,” and “Crazy Love.”

We don’t have a recording from that night, but we do have one from a few weeks later. Listen in on Bruce’s soundcheck at The Omni in Atlanta, on March 23, 1988. On this night, Bruce mashes up “Crazy Love” with “Tupelo Honey,” and although the sound is distant, it’s simply beautiful.

“Crazy Love” would have made a beautiful addition (with or without “Tupelo Honey”) to the Tunnel of Love setlist. Originally released as a B-side, Morrison’s short, sweet 1970 song has become an enduring and frequently covered standard.
