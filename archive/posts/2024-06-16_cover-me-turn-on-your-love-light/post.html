<p>If you ask me which classic R&amp;B songs deserve to turn up on Bruce’s next album of soul covers, “Turn On Your Love Light” would be near the top of my list.</p>
<p>I mean <em>come on</em>: How can anyone in E Street Nation listen to Bobby “Blue” Bland’s classic 1961 hit and not hear its influence on Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band?</p>

<p>With a killer horn riff, lovelorn vocals, desperate begging, and that sax solo taking us <em>a little bit higher</em>, “Turn on Your Love Light” would have been just as much at home on the Born to Run Tour as on World Tour 2024.</p>
<p>Heck, you can even hear its influence on the Seeger Sessions Band!</p>

<p>So it’s absolutely mystifying that Springsteen has yet to perform it on the E Street stage.</p>
<p>Even if somehow Bruce hadn’t latched on to Bland’s original (which made it to #2 on the Billboard R&amp;B chart and #28 on the Hot 100), it seems like virtually all of his musical influences were covering it in the sixties. From Van Morrison…</p>

<p>…to Jerry Lee Lewis and more.</p>

<p>And then of course, there are the epic Grateful Dead jams (some of which even included a familiar guest saxophonist).</p>

<p>So why no Springsteen concert performances in the last half-century? Beats the heck out of me. The closest we’ve come is a handful of hat-tips during the band intros on the Rising Tour.</p>

<p>Maybe it has something to do with the few times he <em>did </em>perform it, some 53 years ago during a trio (at least) of club gigs at the Jersey Shore.</p>
<p>It was during Bruce’s Steel Mill era, and the band was, shall we say, loose. (I’m guessing more than a few drinks had been consumed.) And while there are plenty of classic rock songs that would have been well-suited for a guitar-heavy Steel Mill jam treatment, “Turn On Your Love Light” isn’t one of them.</p>

<p>Yikes. I could understand shying away from a song after a performance like that.</p>
<p>But come on, Bruce. Enough time has passed. You’ve got the horns, and you’ve got Bland’s ability to turn on a dime from crooner to preacher. It’s time to give “Turn On Your Love Light” a proper outing.</p>
<p>Let it shine!</p>
