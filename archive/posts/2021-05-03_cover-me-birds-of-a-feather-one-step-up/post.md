Like many bands in 2020, the Birds of a Feather used the great shutdown as an opportunity to create new music–both originals and covers.

By any measure, they’ve been astoundingly productive: they recently finished recording their upcoming album while performing weekly livestream concerts for their fans (their *fiftieth* weekly show just aired last week).

They’ve also been recording a series of beautiful cover performances in their Acoustic Sessions series, including this delicate rendition of “[One Step Up](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/08/17/roll-of-the-dice-one-step-up/),” featuring Ryan Leon on guitar, Amy McKay on piano, and their lovely duet vocal.

“One Step Up” is one of Bruce’s saddest and loneliest songs, and like its album-mate “[Brilliant Disguise](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/02/06/roll-of-the-dice-brilliant-disguise/),” it translates to a duet without losing any of its poignancy.
