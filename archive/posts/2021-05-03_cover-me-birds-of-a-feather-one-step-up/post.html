<p>Like many bands in 2020, the Birds of a Feather used the great shutdown as an opportunity to create new music–both originals and covers.</p>
<p>By any measure, they’ve been astoundingly productive: they recently finished recording their upcoming album while performing weekly livestream concerts for their fans (their <em>fiftieth</em> weekly show just aired last week).</p>
<p>They’ve also been recording a series of beautiful cover performances in their Acoustic Sessions series, including this delicate rendition of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/08/17/roll-of-the-dice-one-step-up/">One Step Up</a>,” featuring Ryan Leon on guitar, Amy McKay on piano, and their lovely duet vocal.</p>

<p>“One Step Up” is one of Bruce’s saddest and loneliest songs, and like its album-mate “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/02/06/roll-of-the-dice-brilliant-disguise/">Brilliant Disguise</a>,” it translates to a duet without losing any of its poignancy.</p>
