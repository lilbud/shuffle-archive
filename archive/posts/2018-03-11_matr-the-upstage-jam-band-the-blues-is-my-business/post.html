<p>Not quite a year ago, Bruce joined the all-star Upstage Jam Band (featuring Southside Johnny and Little Steven &amp; The Disciples of Soul) on-stage at the Paramount Theatre in Asbury Park. First up: a cover of Etta James’ “The Blues is My Business,” one of the standout tracks on Little Steven’s latest album.</p>
