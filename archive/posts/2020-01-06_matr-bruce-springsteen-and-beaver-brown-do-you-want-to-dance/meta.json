Tour was still two years in the future. But for Bruce Springsteen, an &#8220;off-year&#8221; summer meant no less than <em>twenty\u00a0</em>unadvertised surprise appearances at Jersey shore clubs.</p>\n<p>From storied venues like The Stone Pony and Big Man&#8217;s West to the lesser-known Brighton Bar and the Monmouth County Fair, Bruce seemed to be everywhere that summer.</p>\n<p>Most often appearing with Stone Pony house band Cats on a Smooth Surface, Bruce also appeared with Clarence Clemons &amp; The Red Bank Rockers, Sonny Kenn &amp; The Wild Ideas, Billy Chinnock, The Iron City Houserockers, Mama Tried and Stray Cats.</p>\n<p>Bruce also played with Beaver Brown&#8211;still a year away from the peak of their <em>Eddie and the Cruisers </em>popularity&#8211;four times that summer, including Saturday night, August 7th.</p>\n<p>That night is best known for the debut of what would eventually become &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/01/22/roll-of-the-dice-downbound-train/\">Downbound Train,</a>&#8221; but for my money, the highlight of the night was Bruce and the band&#8217;s first-ever performance of Bobby Freeman&#8217;s &#8220;Do You Want to Dance.&#8221; Without the demands of nightly marathon concerts, Bruce&#8217;s vocals were in great form, and their performance was captured in very good quality for an almost forty-year-old bar gig.
