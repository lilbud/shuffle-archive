<p>Inspiration can come from the unlikeliest of places.</p>
<p>In 1966, Jackie Lee took a novelty song called “The Duck” all the way to #14 on the Billboard Hot 100.</p>

<p>Shortly after the song’s release in November 1965, <em>American Bandstand </em>turned “The Duck” into a short-lived dance craze. (I have to admit, though, that even after watching this clip, I still have no idea how to do The Duck.)</p>

<p>“The Duck” is largely forgotten today, but it made an impression on a young Smokey Robinson, who quickly crafted a song for the Temptations modeled after it. The Temptations recorded Robinson’s song, “Get Ready,”  mere weeks after the release of “The Duck” and debuted it in February 1966.</p>

<p>“Get Ready” was a hit–although not nearly the hit that “The Duck” was, peaking only at #29 on the Hot 100. (It did top the Billboard R&amp;B chart, though.)</p>
<p>Four years later, another Motown band had better luck. Rare Earth covered “Get Ready” as the title track for their 1970 album and decided to release it as a single. That required just a bit of editing magic, though, because the album track was more than <em>twenty-one minutes long.</em></p>

<p>The resulting single (pared down to under three minutes) was a huge hit, peaking all the way at #4 on the Billboard Hot 100 and even making the Top Ten in Billboard’s year-end ranking.</p>

<p>But even though Rare Earth had the bigger hit, it’s The Temptations’ version that’s best remembered and honored today. In 1989, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inducted The Temptations, and at the all-star celebratory jam session, “Get Ready” was one of the songs performed.</p>
<p>Bruce Springsteen was on hand that night, and while he didn’t contribute vocals to “Get Ready,” he lent his guitar talents as part of the backing band. Pay close attention below at about the fifty second mark, and you’ll catch him.</p>

<p>And yes, I realize that was an awfully long walk for an very small Springsteen contribution, but what can I say? I’m a completist.</p>
