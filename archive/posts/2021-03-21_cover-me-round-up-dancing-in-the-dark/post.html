(Check out the first installment featuring covers of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/09/11/roll-of-the-dice-im-on-fire/">I’m on Fire</a>” <a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/03/05/cover-me-round-up-im-on-fire/">here</a>.)</p>
<p>Leading off today’s tour is Toronto indie-disco/neo-soul band, Human Magic. Recorded during the pandemic, their cover of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/12/25/roll-of-the-dice-dancing-in-the-dark/">Dancing in the Dark</a>” is urgent, funky, and features a trombone solo instead of The Big Man’s sax. It works amazingly well–this is one of my favorite “Dancing in the Dark” covers in many moons.</p>

<p>Next, let’s slow it down with New York-based Morgan James’ 2014 cover, from her debut album <em>Hunter</em>.</p>

<p>Morgan’s cover is lonely and yearning, just like Bruce’s lyrics, and her stripped down live performance (released the same week as her album) is fantastic, too.</p>

<p>Let’s stay in this mellow groove for just a bit longer and hop across the pond to take in Blackburn-based self-professed “sad white boy indie band” Waltz Away and their appropriate take on Bruce’s greatest hit.</p>

<p>Okay, that’s enough brooding. Now let’s turn the pace and volume up a notch with Michigan-based Billy Moon, and his awesomely hard-rocking version of “Dancing in the Dark.” This one’s been around for several years, but it’s been undeservingly under the radar.</p>

<p>We’ve got time for one more in this installment, and it’s one of my favorites.</p>
<p>Like most of us, the Minnesota-based Holtze family found themselves spending a lot of extra time together (and almost zero time with anyone else). Luckily, the Holtzes are a musical family, so they put the extra family time to good use and started recording creative arrangements of popular songs and sharing them with the world.</p>
<p>Their version of “Dancing in the Dark” features stomping boots, rattling keys, a lovely violin, and a family of gorgeous vocals.</p>

<p>That’s it for this installment, but there will definitely be more–there are too many great Springsteen covers out there that deserve more attention!</p>
