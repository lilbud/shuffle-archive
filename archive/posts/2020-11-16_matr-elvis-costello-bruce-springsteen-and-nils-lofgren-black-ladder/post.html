<p>Only years after the release of Patti Scialfa’s superb third album, <em>Play It As It Lays</em>, would the strength, stamina, devotion, and deep abiding love in the album’s final two-minute track snap into focus.</p>
<p>“Black Ladder” is one of Patti’s bravest songs, and one of her most telling.</p>

<p>Anyone surprised by Bruce Springsteen’s revelation in 2016 of a lifelong struggle with depression clearly hadn’t paid much attention to his wife’s lyrics in 2007.</p>
<p>The titular black ladder is a metaphor for the harrowing journey through the depths of a loved one’s depression to find, reach, and connect with them. Patti’s been down that ladder many times.</p>
<p>We all have that ladder, though. Bruce’s may be particularly deep and well-traveled, but at one time or another, we all fall down it. Patti’s no exception, as she reveals in “Black Ladder,” and her song is at heart a pledge of devotion between two partners willing to make the trip down each other’s ladder when needed and guide the other back up.</p>
<p>“Black Ladder” is a beautiful, powerful song, and a perfect capstone for a collection of songs breathtaking in their blend of bravery and vulnerability.</p>
<p>It’s also a an extraordinarily deep cut, even for the most devoted fan.</p>
<p>That’s why it was a shock and surprise when Elvis Costello chose “Black Ladder” for his set list when Bruce made a guest appearance on Elvis’ <em>Spectacle </em>series in 2009. Patti wasn’t present, and her album was already two years old by that point, so Elvis’ inclusion was purely an expression of admiration and appreciation.</p>
<p>Accompanied by both Bruce and Nils on guitar (in a superb mix), Elvis took the lead vocal and did Patti proud with an achingly beautiful rendition.</p>

<p>This was the first and only time Bruce has played “Black Ladder” in concert. Even with his own wife, it’s remained unplayed ever since.</p>
