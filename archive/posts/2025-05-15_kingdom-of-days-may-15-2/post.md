**1971:** Dr. Zoom and the Sonic Boom make their second and final appearance under that moniker, at Newark State College's Ernie the Chicken Festival. Miraculously, the show is recorded in very good quality–take a listen below for great covers like "[Will You Love Me Tomorrow](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/01/20/cover-me-will-you-love-me-tomorrow/)" and "[It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/04/23/cover-me-it-takes-a-lot-to-laugh-it-takes-a-train-to-cry/)" and great Springsteen originals like "[Look Towards the Land](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/12/10/roll-of-the-dice-look-towards-the-land/)" and "[Goin' Back to Georgia](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/03/07/roll-of-the-dice-goin-back-to-georgia/)." Later that same evening, Bruce makes his debut as a member of The Sundance Blues Band at The Student Prince.

**1993:** Bruce, Shane Fontayne, Bobby King, and Tommy Sims notice a dancing school ball being held in their hotel in Munich and decide to make an uninvited guest appearance. Someone had the presence of mind to capture the merriment and mayhem, and although it's very shaky at the start, it's still a fun watch. Check out "[Lucille](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/11/29/cover-me-lucille/)" and "Twist and Shout" below.

**2005:** The highlight of Bruce's solo acoustic show at Cleveland State University is undoubtedly the tour premiere of "Stolen Car," the first time (outside of a 2003 benefit show) Bruce has played this song in two decades.
