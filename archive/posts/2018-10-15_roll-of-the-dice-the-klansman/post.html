<p>On March 10, 1983, Bruce sat down in his new home studio in his Los Angeles home, switched on a drum machine, and recorded “The Klansman,” a dark reminiscence of a home visit by a KKK recruiter through the eyes of a child.</p>

<p>Unlike many of other acoustic outtakes from this period, “The Klansman” is virtually fully formed. There are a few lyrical rough edges that suggest that Bruce wasn’t quite done polishing it, but it’s clearly “content complete.” It features Bruce in the taut storytelling mode of his recent <em>Nebraska</em> album, but it isn’t hard to imagine “The Klansman” in an electric arrangement on <em>Born in the U.S.A. </em></p>
<p>The melody is sinister and foreboding (Bruce plays every instrument); we know that something bad is afoot almost before Bruce lays it out in the opening verse:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Word of the trouble spread around</em><br/>
<em>One day a man came to my town</em><br/>
<em>In the kitchen when my Pa let him in</em><br/>
<em>He shook my hand, said, “Son, the Klan’s your friend”</em></p>
<p>We never learn what the “trouble” is, but given the greeting of the mysterious visitor, it isn’t hard to imagine. The recruiter continues–presumably addressing the father now:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>“Was a meeting at Lyle Stanton’s house on the Jefferson Highway</em><br/>
<em>Some they did not listen, some did not turn away”</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Said, “When the holy rain of fire comes tumbling from above</em><br/>
<em>It’ll be a Klansman who stands for the land he loves”</em><br/>
<em>Look away, look away now</em></p>
<p>That’s a pretty strong pitch. We’re left to wonder how the father will react during a short instrumental interlude, and then the story continues, some time later:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>I was ten years old when my Pa said, “Son, some day you will see</em><br/>
<em>When you grow to wear the robes like your brother and me”</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>“When the war between the races leaves us in a fiery dream</em><br/>
<em>It’ll be a Klansman who will wipe this country clean</em><br/>
<em>This, son, is my dream”</em></p>
<p>Bruce’s vocals give nothing away–his delivery is unflinching. We can discern neither a young boy’s pride in his father nor a grown man’s shame.</p>
<p>We’re left to wonder which path the boy chose for himself, which is undoubtedly the exact effect Bruce was aiming for.</p>
<p>Rumors still fly about a someday-soon box set treatment for <em>Born in the U.S.A. </em>and its contemporary outtakes. Odds are good–or at least they <em>should</em> be–that “The Klansman” will finally see a release if and when.</p>
