<p>Today’s entry is an unusual one. I’ve covered unreleased songs and even work-in-progress snippets, but this is the first essay for which we don’t even have a scrap of music to listen to.</p>
<p>The only reason we know that “Until the Rain Comes” exists is that its lyrics were included in the 2006 public auction of a notebook containing lyrics from songs Bruce had written in 1968 at the tender age of eighteen.</p>

<p>The table of contents shows several previously-unknown songs.</p>

<p>The ninth song, “Until the Rain Comes,” is actually known to have been played by Bruce during his solo acoustic shows that spring and summer, but no recording has surfaced.</p>

<p>The handwritten lyrics are above (thanks to springsteenlyrics.com), but here they are transcribed:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Today I sail from the shores of my homeland</em><br/>
<em>reflections upon the water enchant my searching eyes</em><br/>
<em>Across the flaming clouds rides the brave Apollo</em><br/>
<em>until the rain comes leaving silence on the sky</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I lay upon the soft green grass and think for many days</em><br/>
<em>voices to my left and right tear me in two ways</em><br/>
<em>Upon reaching the ancient age of 18 I have found</em><br/>
<em>what is round isn’t round at all, and what is up may be down</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>A windy day is running near, the white dove flies alone</em><br/>
<em>broken brothers tear the earth and turn into dried up bones</em><br/>
<em>I ask for an answer and do not hear a sound</em><br/>
<em>lies upon lies again, until the rain comes</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The emerald waves lap upon the shore</em><br/>
<em>kiss the naked body of the night before</em><br/>
<em>The sweet young sparrow weeps for things she’s never done</em><br/>
<em>and I’ll drink her love, when the rain comes</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>So I cut the ropes that bind my craft to the shore</em><br/>
<em>and sail upon the open sea, where freedom flows so pure</em><br/>
<em>Back upon the sandy beach a child cries with dawn</em><br/>
<em>I’ll never return again, until the rain comes</em></p>
<p>Lyrically (and that’s all we have to go on), “Until the Rain Comes” is very much the product of an 18-year-old, newly independent, questioning and unsure, saying goodbye to his childhood and venturing forth into adulthood.</p>
<p>Perhaps a recording will surface one day and we’ll hear Bruce breathe life into the song.</p>
