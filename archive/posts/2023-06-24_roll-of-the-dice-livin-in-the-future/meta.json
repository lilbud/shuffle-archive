That\u2019s Orwellian&#8230; You get frightened for your family, for your home. And you realize how countries can move way off course, very far from democratic ideals. Add another terrorist attack or two, and the country can turn into a pretty scary place&#8230; It happens in a very American way \u2013 the flag is flying over civil liberties as they crumble.&#8221;\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">&#8212; Bruce Springsteen, <em>Rolling Stone</em>, November 1, 2007</span></p></blockquote>\n<p>Twenty years ago, most Americans believed their country was headed in the wrong direction.</p>\n<p>Still reeling from horrific terror attacks, the United States was in the early days of a pair of wars that would kill over a half million people across two decades.</p>\n<p>To make matters worse, it had become clear that one of those two wars was predicated on falsehoods. Convinced of a connection unsupported by evidence, the Bush administration lied their way into an eight-year war in Iraq that exacted a toll not just overseas but at home as well.</p>\n<p>In the name of safety and security, the administration spearheaded a rollback of rights and freedoms that chilled the blood of citizens and ignited a tug-of-war over civil liberties that continues to this day.</p>\n<p>By October 2003, polls began to reflect the new majority opinion: America had lost its way, and it was straying ever further from its ideals.</p>\n<p>Bruce Springsteen was a member of that emerging majority, and he had something to say about it. He&#8217;d already been doing so from the stage. At the closing stand of the Rising Tour that month, he admonished:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>There&#8217;s been a lot of questions lately raised about the forthrightness of the government. I just want to say that playing with the truth during wartime has been a part of both Democratic and Republican administrations in the past, and it&#8217;s always wrong when the lives of our sons and daughters are on the line. The question of whether we were misled to the war in Iraq is not really a liberal or a conservative question. It&#8217;s an American question that goes to the heart of protecting the democracy we ask our sons and our daughters to die for. It&#8217;s our sacred trust as citizens to demand accountability and the truth from our leaders. That&#8217;s the meaning of patriotism.</em></p>\n<p>When the tour ended the next day, so did Springsteen&#8217;s bully pulpit. Still seething, he turned to his notebook and began writing what would eventually become his fifteenth studio album. (He&#8217;d take a four-year, two-album detour before getting around to recording it.)</p>\n<p>&#8220;I wrote some of [<em>Magic</em>] the minute I came off <em>The Rising,&#8221; </em> Springsteen told Joe Levy in <em>Rolling Stone</em> in 2007. \u00a0&#8220;My idea was to pick up with the political and social results of what came out of the tragedy of 9/11. &#8216;Livin\u2019 in the Future&#8217; I\u2019ve had since then. It\u2019s about how terribly fucked up things have gotten. It\u2019s a song about apathy, and how what you never thought could happen has happened already.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Livin&#039; In the Future\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/I6x06jXRD70?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>For such a bitter song, &#8220;Livin&#8217; in the Future&#8221; sure is bouncy. Its backing track is an amalgam of &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/11/19/roll-of-the-dice-tenth-avenue-freeze-out/\">Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out</a>&#8221; and Gary U.S. Bond&#8217;s &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/04/18/rotd-matr-gary-u-s-bonds-bruce-springsteen-and-the-e-street-band-out-of-work/\">Out of Work</a>&#8221; (which Springsteen wrote), and it has the strut and swagger of both. That&#8217;s intentional.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Livin&#8217; in the Future&#8221; is Springsteen&#8217;s only 21st-century recording that sounds like it was recorded by the 1970s E Street Band, with both Danny Federici and Clarence Clemons taking generous turns in the spotlight.\u00a0Even the trademark early E Street glockenspiel is present (although oddly,\u00a0 it&#8217;s Bruce rather than Danny on those keys), a dead giveaway that this retro sound is deliberate.</p>\n<p>Why does Bruce revive his 20th century sound? In order to take us back in time so that we might better recognize how much the world has changed in the years since.</p>\n<p>Lyrically, &#8220;Livin&#8217; in the Future&#8221; is\u00a0 a companion song to &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/05/31/roll-of-the-dice-your-own-worst-enemy/\">Your Own Worst Enemy.</a>&#8221; (The latter is the stronger of the two both lyrically and musically.) Both are patriot songs in the truest sense: they hold allegiance to the American ideal of democracy and liberty for all, and they hold the nation accountable for falling short of it.</p>\n<p>Both are written in the form of relationship songs, a decision Bruce made for both artistic and pragmatic reasons. &#8220;I tried to combine personal and political,&#8221; he told Levy, &#8220;so you can read into the songs either way. You can read the record as a comment on what\u2019s been going on, or you can read it just as relationship songs.&#8221;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>A letter come blowing in on an ill wind</em><br />\n<em>Something &#8217;bout me and you never seeing one another again</em><br />\n<em>Yeah, well I knew it&#8217;d come, still I was struck deaf and dumb</em><br />\n<em>Like when we kissed, that taste of blood on your tongue</em></p>\n<p>Bruce lays it out from the start: <em>You&#8217;re leaving. You&#8217;re leaving, and you&#8217;re not coming back.</em></p>\n<p>The <em>you\u00a0\u00a0</em>in question is America. Or perhaps more precisely, the American Experiment that George Washington first wrote about in 1790: &#8220;The establishment of our new government seemed to be the last great experiment for promoting human happiness, by reasonable compact, in civil society. It was to be&#8230; a government of accommodation as well as a government of laws.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Through corrosive legislation, and more terrifyingly through fiat (for which Bruce&#8217;s &#8220;Dear John&#8221; letter serves as metaphor), America incrementally betrays its citizens. Each erosion of rights is an omen of the next, and the great experiment seems headed for failure.</p>\n<p>Our narrator sees it coming but can&#8217;t quite bring himself to believe it. He can sense it in her actions; he can taste it in her kiss. But when he calls his lover out for her gradual betrayal, she soothes him reassuringly:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Don&#8217;t worry darling, now baby don&#8217;t you fret</em><br />\n<em>We&#8217;re living in the future and none of this has happened yet</em></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s okay, she tells him. All that stuff you&#8217;re worried about down the road? That&#8217;s down the road. Worry about today, not tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Today. Not tomorrow.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s our narrator&#8217;s dilemma: tomorrow isn&#8217;t anything but a string of todays.</p>\n<p>He&#8217;s got Boiling Frog Syndrome: Put a frog in boiling water and it&#8217;ll leap right out. Put him in lukewarm water and slowly raise the temperature a degree at a time, and he won&#8217;t sense the danger until it&#8217;s too late. His girl is turning up the heat slowly but ever so surely.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Woke up Election Day, skies gunpowder and shades of grey</em><br />\n<em>Beneath the dirty sun I whistle my time away</em><br />\n<em>Then just about sundown you come walking through town</em><br />\n<em>Your boot heels clicking like the barrel of a pistol spinning round</em></p>\n<p>The Election Day reference is commonly seen by fans and critics as giving away the game&#8211;breaking the metaphor to ensure the listener recognizes the political context. But the verse works in relationship context, too:\u00a0<em>every\u00a0</em>day is Election Day, Bruce tells us. Every day is a decision day.</p>\n<p>Each day, his narrator is confronted with new evidence of his love&#8217;s betrayal, and each day he chooses to whistle his time away and ignore it. At the end of each day, however, he can&#8217;t help but sense it, hear it, see it.</p>\n<p>Bruce&#8217;s use of Western imagery suggests a pivotal confrontation is coming. (Hilariously, it also betrays Bruce&#8217;s unfamiliarity with firearms: the barrel of a pistol does not spin. He&#8217;s thinking of the pistol&#8217;s <em>chamber</em>.) But again, she reassures him:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Don&#8217;t worry darling, now baby don&#8217;t you fret</em><br />\n<em>We&#8217;re living in the future and none of this has happened yet</em></p>\n<p>And again, he heeds her words instead of his own instincts. He is complicit in his own gaslighting.</p>\n<p>In the bridge, our narrator has a moment of clarity: he feels the ground shift beneath his feet; he feels a giant wave looming. He&#8217;s tried his best to keep his faith and belief, but he&#8217;s reached a tipping point.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>The earth it gave away, the sea rose towards the sun</em><br />\n<em>I opened up my heart to you, it got all damaged and undone</em><br />\n<em>My ship Liberty sailed away on a bloody red horizon</em><br />\n<em>The groundskeeper opened the gates and let the wild dogs run</em></p>\n<p>Naming his ship\u00a0<em>Liberty</em> is a bit on the nose; the sudden metaphor shift in the last line is clumsy, too. It&#8217;s a rare instance of lyrical laziness from Bruce, and there&#8217;s another one coming. Still, the verse is effective in conveying that the frog is boiling, and the frog knows it.</p>\n<p>For a moment, our narrator can see the future clearly, and it is bleak.\u00a0It&#8217;s a moment of full awareness, but only a moment.</p>\n<p>For the final verse, Bruce reverts to Old West imagery as the frog adapts to the boiling water. (Hey, if Bruce can mix his metaphors, we can too.)</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I&#8217;m rolling through town, a lost cowboy at sundown</em><br />\n<em>Got my monkey on a leash, got my ear tuned to the ground</em><br />\n<em>My faith&#8217;s been torn asunder, tell me is that rolling thunder</em><br />\n<em>Or just the sinking sound of something righteous going under</em></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s the song&#8217;s second reference to sundown, a deliberate repetition to imply impending darkness. Or as Bruce would say each night in concert during the Magic Tour, &#8220;it&#8217;s early&#8230; but it&#8217;s getting late.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Our narrator feels it latening, but in spite of it (or perhaps because of it), he chooses to heed his lover&#8217;s words and live for today.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Don&#8217;t worry darling, now baby don&#8217;t you fret</em><br />\n<em>We&#8217;re living in the future and none of this has happened yet</em></p>\n<p>Still, he knows tomorrow isn&#8217;t that far off. He hears the ominous sound of rolling thunder, and he knows what it signifies.\u00a0Something righteous is dying (point deduction for &#8220;righteous&#8221; when &#8220;sacred&#8221; would have scored a quadruple alliteration), but he takes comfort in his partner&#8217;s words.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s 2003, and the future is wide open. Today is just today. Surely in twenty years, America will be as strong and true as ever, with all rights and liberties and transparency restored.</p>\n<p>Maybe we don&#8217;t know what 2023 holds in store for us, but we at least know this: none of it has happened yet.</p>\n<p>&#8212;-</p>\n<p>&#8220;Livin&#8217; in the Future&#8221; was the first song written for\u00a0<em>Magic,\u00a0</em>and it was the centerpiece of every show on the tour. Each night (even during his European shows), Bruce took a moment during the song&#8217;s introduction to make sure\u00a0 his audience understood his message.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen, Livin&#039; in the future, Live in Stockholm\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pq4GKUP3OUE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>More than any other song on the album or in the set list, &#8220;Livin&#8217; in the Future&#8221; carried Springsteen&#8217;s\u00a0 message for the tour: <em>Don&#8217;t think it can&#8217;t happen here.
