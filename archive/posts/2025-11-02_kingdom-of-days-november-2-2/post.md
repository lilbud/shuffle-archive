***New for 2025:** New entry for 1977; article for 1978; review for 2007*

**1974:** Bruce and the E Street Band play their second of two nights at the Tower Theater in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania. We can forgive the reviewer for mis-identifying “Jungle Man,” since the song is still almost a year from being released.

**1977:** At a recording session at the Record Plant in New York City, Bruce and the E Street Band work on “Come On (Let’s Go Tonight).”

**1978:** The final leg of the Darkness Tour picks up steam at the Capital Center in Largo. The local press is less interested in the show than in Bruce’s… well, read for yourself.

Memorial Sports Arena, where “[Johnny Bye-Bye](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/07/13/roll-of-the-dice-johnny-bye-bye/)” returns to the set for its second tour performance, and “Stolen Car” gets a rare outing.

**1997:** Asked to contribute a song for an upcoming Pete Seeger tribute album, Bruce contacts a group of musicians he’d recently met (members of The Gotham Playboys, who had played private parties at his house) and some additional friends, and he assembles the ensemble at his home studio in Rumson. The recording session that ensues will become known as the first “Seeger Session,” and six songs are recorded: “[We Shall Overcome](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/08/15/roll-of-the-dice-cover-me-we-shall-overcome/),” “[My Oklahoma Home](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/03/04/cover-me-my-oklahoma-home/),” “[Jesse James](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/07/10/roll-of-the-dice-cover-me-jesse-james/),” “[Hobo’s Lullaby](https://estreetshuffle.com/?p=20113), “I Come and Stand at Every Door,” and “Pretty Boy Floyd.” Those last two are still unreleased to this day.

**2002:** Bruce makes his by now expected appearance at the third annual Light of Day benefit at Tradewinds in Sea Bright, once again joining Joe Grushecky and The Houserockers for an hour of their set. Garland Jeffreys and Bob Benjamin join in the fun, as does Gary U.S. Bonds, who plays a set of his own later that night. Around midnight, Bruce returned to the stage with Bonds to play “[Jole Blon](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/08/29/matr-gary-u-s-bonds-and-bruce-springsteen-jole-blon/)” and “[Quarter to Three](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/08/21/cover-me-quarter-to-three/).”
