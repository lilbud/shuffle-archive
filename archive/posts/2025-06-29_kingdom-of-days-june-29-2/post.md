**1962:** Adele Springsteen takes Bruce and Ginny to their first-ever rock concert when Chubby Checker plays at Steel Pier in Atlantic City. She also takes them to see Anita Bryant that evening. Bruce enjoys the afternoon show a lot more than the evening show.

**1984:** A big, big night for Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band: The Born in the U.S.A. Tour kicks off at the St. Paul Civic Center Arena, with Nils and Patti making their official debuts as full-fledged members of the band. Film director Brian De Palma is on hand to film Bruce’s performance (twice!) of “[Dancing in the Dark](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/12/25/roll-of-the-dice-dancing-in-the-dark/)” for the now classic music video, and fan [Sandi Pederson is front and center](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/06/28/where-the-band-was-st-paul-june-28-1984/). This is also Courtney Cox’s debut–as most people know, she’s the “lucky fan” pulled out of the audience to dance with Bruce on-stage.

Watch footage from the video premiere below, and then listen to a never-before-circulated soundboard recording of Bruce’s first-ever public concert performance of “Dancing in the Dark.” (Sorry about those drum machines…)
