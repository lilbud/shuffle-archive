They played three covers together (&#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/07/15/matr-bruce-springsteen-and-just-about-everybody-mustang-sally/\">Mustang Sally</a>,&#8221; &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/08/13/matr-bruce-springsteen-neil-young-and-exit-105-all-along-the-watchtower/\">All Along the Watchtower,</a>&#8221; and a 30-minute version of &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/06/24/cover-me-not-fade-away/\">Not Fade Away</a>&#8220;), and they played two Solar Circus originals, including &#8220;Stems and Seeds.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Bruce doesn&#8217;t sing in the recording below (since this was an impromptu performance, we can assume that he wasn&#8217;t familiar enough with the band&#8217;s original songs), but we can hear his prominent guitar throughout, especially when he takes a solo about five minutes in.</p>\n<div id=\"v-wvkjqrYF-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='568' src='https://videopress.com/embed/wvkjqrYF?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>That was the first and only time Bruce performed with Solar Circus.
