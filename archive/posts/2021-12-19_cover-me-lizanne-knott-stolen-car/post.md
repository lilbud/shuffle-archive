The last time Bruce had a milestone birthday, Philadelphia’s WXPN-FM (shout-out to my all-time favorite radio station) organized an on-air 60th Birthday Bash tribute.

The event featured an array of wonderful artists, but their song choices largely hewed to the usual candidates. There were several “” covers, a couple versions of “Born to Run,” and of course a few “” renditions.

But singer/songwriter Lizanne Knott went deep that night, turning in a lovely cover of “Stolen Car.”

More wistful than haunted, Lizanne’s arrangement makes for a very different song than Bruce’s original. But isn’t that what a cover should be?

Lizanne finally released her cover of “Stolen Car” years later on her 2016 album, .

*Excellent Day*
