meta-description: Only Bruce Springsteen could write such a perfect pop song and have no recollection of it. Thank goodness he remembered, because “Give the Girl a Kiss” is a gem both on record and in concert.

“I don’t even remember writing it or recording it. It was like, ‘When did I do that?'” – *Bruce Springsteen, Rolling Stone, December 10, 1998*

How talented a songwriter is Bruce Springsteen?

So talented that he can write and record a killer pop song and later have zero recollection of ever having done so.

That quote wasn’t a joke: Bruce admitted to Mark Hagen in the January 1999 issue of , “I didn’t even know that ‘Give the Girl a Kiss’ existed… wow, that’s pretty, that’s fun.”

*Rolling Stone* *Mojo*

And to Patrick Humphries in a month later: “‘Give the Girl a Kiss’, the party thing from Darkness… I didn’t know that existed.”

*Record Collector*

So it’s a little hard to definitively pin down the inspiration for the song, when the songwriter himself can only answer: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Still, it seems highly likely that “Give the Girl a Kiss” was inspired at least in part by “Give Him a Great Big Kiss,” which The Shangri-Las took to #18 in 1964.

Although the songs are different in style, the similar titles and choruses (“Tell her that you love her, tell her that you need her” vs. “Tell him that I love him, tell him that I care”) are a pretty unmistakable hat tip.

Musically and stylistically though, “Give the Girl a Kiss” owes more to contemporary Springsteen originals like “So Young and in Love,” “” and and “” (which are all basically the same song anyway).

But oh, those lyrics: pure pop perfection.

*Well now I ain’t looking for excitement*  
*Baby that’s just a fact*  
*If you want to get to her heart*  
*You better let her know just where you’re at*



*Well I say*  
*It ain’t written in the sky above*  
*Well no fortune-teller told me this*  
*You gotta tell her that you love her*  
*Tell her that you need her*  
*And give the girl a great big kiss*



*Now if you’re such a fool you think*  
*It don’t matter, baby, what you say*  
*Maybe you better tell her how you’re feeling*  
*It ain’t gonna happen any other way*



*‘Cause darling it ain’t written in the sky above*  
*Well don’t you tell her who told me this*  
*You gotta tell her that you need her*  
*Tell her that you love her*  
*And give the girl a great big kiss*  
*Yeah you better give the girl a great big kiss*

The romantic pep talk is a recipe that never fails. It’s a girl group staple (and we know Bruce loves his girl groups), not only for The Shangri-Las but also notably for The Exciters.

(That song would go on to have special significance for Bruce after he was struck by a red-headed woman performing it in a club one night, but that would be a few years up the road.)

Billy Joel would try his hand at a similar confection a few years later as well.

But Bruce distilled the recipe down to its one essential ingredient: the kiss. And in combining those almost-exasperated lyrics with an ultra-carefree, swinging melody, he conjures a protagonist that comes off as encouraging rather than frustrated.

That is, until the bridge gives away the game:

*Now baby all I wanna do*  
*Is darling make sweet love to you*

Aha! So the narrator isn’t giving a pep talk to someone else–he’s talking to himself. Suddenly, “Give the Girl a Kiss” becomes a song of courage, and that makes it all the more endearing.

And speaking of endearing: can we just appreciate how much fun the E Street Band is having here? From Danny’s star turn to Bruce’s “Bosstime!” solo to the overdubbed Horns of Love, “Give the Girl a Kiss” features the E Street Band at their most winning.

*Now I don’t know what the meaning is*  
*Why you wanna hide the things you feel and say*  
*But baby it’s just a natural fact*  
*Love was never meant to be that way*



*And darlin’ it ain’t written in the sky above*  
*Well no fortune-teller told me this*  
*You gotta tell her that you need her*  
*Tell her that you love her*  
*And give the girl a great big kiss*

Did I mention that they recorded this song during the dour sessions (except for the horns, which were added a couple of decades later)? Bruce may not remember “Give the Girl a Kiss” specifically, but he remembers using songs like it to relieve the band after long series of takes tackling darker material.

But the best part of “Give the Girl a Kiss” is still to come:

*Give the girl a great big, great big, great big*  
*Give the girl a great big kiss*

That killer coda: The Big Man bounces his basso “give the girl a great big, great big, great big” while the Boss soars above him. It’s one of my favorite E Street moments on record. And you can tell Bruce feels the magic, because that coda ends up accounting for 25% of the entire song.

But as fun as “Give the Girl a Kiss” is on record, it’s even more fun live–in part because it’s such a natural singalong, in part because of its irresistible hook, but mostly because it brings out the ham in Bruce.

Once “Give the Girl a Kiss” was officially released on Bruce wasted little time debuting it live. At the second of two warm-up shows for the Reunion Tour (which doubled in the early days as the Tracks Tour), Bruce called it a “silly” song and introduced it with a disclaimer: “We cut this for , and you’re about to see why we didn’t use it.”

*Tracks,* *Darkness on the Edge of Town*

If he meant it didn’t fit with the album’s theme, well, duh. But if Bruce doubted “Give the Girl a Kiss” as a piece of power pop, he needn’t have worried. Watch this delightful debut build to a hilariously comical (and obviously pre-planned) climax:

With a debut like that, why did “Give the Girl a Kiss” disappear for a decade after only two outings on the Reunion Tour? I have no idea–perhaps Bruce simply forgot about it again. We didn’t hear it again until Bruce’s 2009 show in Hershey, and even then it was only in response to a venue-appropriate sign request.

But Bruce’s best “Give the Girl a Kiss” was his last one, this time on the Wrecking Ball Tour. In granting a fan’s request, Bruce added the two essential ingredients missing from the song’s other live outings: brass and spontaneity.

Watch this wonderful performance from Charlottesville in 2012, featuring a loose Bruce at his funniest, and get your signs ready for the next tour–because we need to hear “Give the Girl a Kiss” again soon.
