It just so happens to share the exact same music (right down to the oh-oh-OHs) as the better known\u00a0<em>Tracks</em> track.</p>\n<p>Surviving records suggest that Bruce worked on and recorded &#8220;Phantoms&#8221; and &#8220;Zero and Blind Terry&#8221; simultaneously during the sessions that yielded his second album. Perhaps he intended for the stronger twin to survive; ultimately neither did.</p>\n<p>But whereas &#8220;Zero and Blind Terry&#8221; foretold the arrival of &#8220;Romantic Bruce&#8221; (&#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/12/14/roll-of-the-dice-incident-on-57th-street/\">Incident on 57th Street</a>,&#8221; and &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/04/26/roll-of-the-dice-4th-of-july-asbury-park-sandy/\">4th of July Asbury Park (Sandy)</a>&#8221; lay just ahead in the not-too-distant future), &#8220;Phantoms&#8221; closed the chapter on&#8230; what shall we call him? Western Bruce? Historical Bruce? Hallucinatory Bruce? Regardless, &#8220;Phantoms&#8221; marked the end of songs like &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/09/26/roll-of-the-dice-the-angel/\">The Angel</a>,&#8221; &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/03/06/roll-of-the-dice-santa-ana/\">Santa Ana</a>,&#8221; and &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/12/28/roll-of-the-dice-if-i-was-the-priest/\">If I Was the Priest</a>.&#8221; The tone and imagery of Bruce&#8217;s songs would shift from this point forward.

Maybe we should call him Steampunk Bruce, though, because &#8220;Phantoms&#8221; is a strange amalgamation of a Western rider in an 18th century war in Belize with American F-4 fighter jets screaming overhead. So there&#8217;s that. Or maybe St. George refers to the Utah town, although that&#8217;s doubtful given the St. Croix variants. Best not to think too hard about it.</p>\n<p>And anyway, the key to the song is in the last two lines\u00a0 of the first verse, the emergence of a theme that would come to permeate Bruce&#8217;s work right up to the present day: freedom is oh so seductive but also oh so lonely.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s continue:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Jamey rides down a broken highway, the heat of the sun tends to bring him down</em><br />\n<em>His field is full of crazy visions of negroes and white women in evening gowns</em><br />\n<em>And he hears Jessie calling to him in the hills</em><br />\n<em>Oh she calls to him from the clouds</em><br />\n<em>And the men are working in the fields</em></p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not exactly sure what to make of the &#8220;negroes&#8221; reference, especially since it&#8217;s absent from earlier versions; the uncertain historical and geographical setting makes it difficult to pin down what Bruce intended here. So let&#8217;s instead just focus on the fact that Jamey is getting a little road-crazy, possibly with some heat stroke layered on top. In the rhythmic work of the rock-splitters, he thinks he hears his girl calling out to him.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>\u00a0Oh listen to &#8217;em work (oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-ohhh oh)</em><br />\n<em>Oh busting rocks (oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-ohhh oh)</em><br />\n<em>Oh busting those rocks (oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-ohhh oh)</em><br />\n<em>(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-ohhh oh)</em><br />\n<em>(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-ohhh oh)</em></p>\n<p>The song goes on from here, but truthfully it doesn&#8217;t go anywhere&#8211;the verses repeat, the chanting repeats, as Jamey continues riding down that long lonely road and Jessie continues calling him home.</p>\n<p>Does Jamey ever make it back to Jessie?
