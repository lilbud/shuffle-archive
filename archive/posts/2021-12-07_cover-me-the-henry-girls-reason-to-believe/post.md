The Henry Girls hail from a little village in Ulster, Ireland, but their music incorporates as much Americana influences as it does Irish.

Three multi-instrumental sisters with the last name of McLaughlin (they named their combo after their grandfather), The Henry Girls sing in gorgeous harmony and employ a wide range of instruments when recording and performing, both of which they've been doing for almost two decades.

Their 2014 album, *Louder Than Words*, won deservedly raving reviews for its original material, but tucked deep into the album was a single cover sure to delight Springsteen fans.

"Bruce Springsteen is undoubtedly one of the great songwriters of all time," the trio told *No Depression* in a 2014 interview. "We decided to record '[Reason to Believe'](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/02/27/roll-of-the-dice-reason-to-believe/)... [because] the song is very universal and contemplative, it speaks to a lot of people. It's a haunting portrayal of people clinging to hope in the face of adversity. We were brought up in a rural part of Ireland where religion is very important; it passes along through the generations, often without question. The song resonates with us and so does it resonate with a lot of people who hear it. It's a powerful song. Also, it is a fine piece of music, with a beautiful melody that lends itself so well to harmonies."

The Henry Girls' take on "Reason to Believe" is as understated as Bruce's original recording, but where Bruce sings with a detachment and defeatism, The Henry Girls sing with optimism and resilience. It's a different song as a result.

But as lovely as that studio track is, their live performances are even better. The Henry Girls cover Bruce in concert frequently, and a few of their "Reason to Believe" performances are available on YouTube. Here's my favorite–a quiet, intimate, beautifully arranged version that takes flight at about the one-minute mark and never touches ground again.
