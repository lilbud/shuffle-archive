It\u2019s a haunting portrayal of people clinging to hope in the face of adversity. We were brought up in a rural part of Ireland where religion is very important; it passes along through the generations, often without question. The song resonates with us and so does it resonate with a lot of people who hear it. It\u2019s a powerful song. Also, it is a fine piece of music, with a beautiful melody that lends itself so well to harmonies.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Reason to Believe\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/x039Hklvbc0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>The Henry Girls&#8217; take on &#8220;Reason to Believe&#8221; is as understated as Bruce&#8217;s original recording, but where Bruce sings with a detachment and defeatism, The Henry Girls sing with optimism and resilience. It&#8217;s a different song as a result.</p>\n<p>But as lovely as that studio track is, their live performances are even better. The Henry Girls cover Bruce in concert frequently, and a few of their &#8220;Reason to Believe&#8221; performances are available on YouTube. Here&#8217;s my favorite&#8211;a quiet, intimate, beautifully arranged version that takes flight at about the one-minute mark and never touches ground again.</p>\n<div
