<p>If you only knew Bruce Springsteen from his official studio recordings, you’d probably raise an eyebrow at the notion of him covering a song like “Whole Lotta Love.”</p>
<p>It’s a classic, of course, the first hit single for Led Zeppelin in the U.S. It peaked at #4 on the Billboard Hot 100 and reached #1 in Australia and Germany.</p>

<p>Over the years since its 1969 release, “Whole Lotta Love” has garnered honor after honor. <em>Rolling Stone </em>ranked it #75 on their “500 Greatest Songs of All Time” list, BBC Radio 2 considers it to have the all-time greatest guitar riff, and the song is firmly enshrined in the Grammy Hall of Fame.</p>
<p>But still: Bruce and the E Street Band are known for rock and roll, not hard rock, and “Whole Lotta Love” is one hard-rocking song.</p>
<p>Maybe that’s why Bruce and the band technically didn’t cover it at all–they only sound checked it once, (and only for a minute or so) way back in September 1978 before one of his legendary shows at the Capitol Theater in Passaic.</p>

<p>Still, listening to that one minute of audio, one can’t help but be stunned by Springsteen’s ferocity on the guitar. But then we remember Bruce’s pre-label days fronting the hard-rock band Steel Mill and we realize songs like this are right in his wheelhouse.</p>
<p>Even though he’d left those days a good eight years in the past, this one-time only recording is a great reminder that guitar heroes never die–they just save it up for the occasional sound check.</p>
