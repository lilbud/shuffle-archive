In fact, Bruce used to catch Christie&#8217;s gigs in Greenwich Village but (according to Christie in an <em>Asbury Park Press</em> interview) was too intimidated to approach the famous singer at the time. When the two finally met in 2009, Bruce told Christie that his doo wop-era classics ranked among his favorite records.</p>\n<p>Those favorites almost certainly included Christie&#8217;s 1963 Top Ten single, &#8220;Two Faces Have I.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Lou Christie - Two Faces Have I\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/e3QFcVYCBdM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;Two Faces Have I&#8221; peaked at #6 on the Billboard Hot 100, and it finished at #44 for the year. But it wasn&#8217;t just the falsetto and the catchy melody that likely caught Bruce&#8217;s attention. Something about the chorus also lodged itself in his brain.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Two faces have I</em><br />\n<em>One to laugh and one to cry</em></p>\n<p>Christie&#8217;s song wasn&#8217;t about dual personalities or warring natures; it was just a simple pop break-up song featuring a narrator who hides his heartbreak from the world. But the notion of\u00a0<em>two faces&#8211;</em>one that laughs and one that cries&#8211;likely resonated, and it surfaced to the top of his mind when writing material for what would become\u00a0<em>Tunnel of Love</em>.</p>\n<p>By that time, Bruce was well aware of his more destructive side, and he&#8217;d already started understanding and grappling with it via therapy&#8211;which may be why he began grappling with it more directly in his songwriting as well.</p>\n<p>He was still Bruce Springsteen, though. He might have been ready to address his demons lyrically, but musically he&#8217;d hide them in a deceptively upbeat solo backing track&#8211;solo, that is, except for Max Weinberg on drums and what <em>must</em> be Danny Federici on the organ, although if so he is strangely uncredited.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Two Faces&#8221; is a spare song both in orchestration and narration. Bruce&#8217;s lyrics are among his most economical, eschewing metaphor beyond the titular, and yet they are powerfully effective&#8211;building tension towards the bridge, tension we don&#8217;t even detect at first listen.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I met a girl and we ran away</em><br />\n<em>I swore I&#8217;d make her happy every day</em><br />\n<em>And how I made her cry</em><br />\n<em>Two faces have I</em></p>\n<p>Once we&#8217;ve heard the song in full, we can hear the song in a darker light, but on first listen, following a carefree instrumental introduction, we hear that third line (&#8220;and how I made her cry&#8221;) as wedding day tears of happiness. Only the verse&#8217;s final line provides more ominous shading, and in the second verse Bruce employs pedestrian symbolism to deepen the rumbling.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Sometimes mister I feel sunny and wild</em><br />\n<em>Lord I love to see my baby smile</em><br />\n<em>Then dark clouds come rolling by</em><br />\n<em>Two faces have I</em></p>\n<p>Until this point, our narrator has only hinted at darker doings. He&#8217;s happy and in love, but there&#8217;s a sense of something darker brewing. We don&#8217;t have to wait any longer for it though&#8211;the sky opens in the bridge.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>One that laughs one that cries</em><br />\n<em>One says hello one says goodbye</em><br />\n<em>One does things I don&#8217;t understand</em><br />\n<em>Makes me feel like half a man</em></p>\n<p>And there it is&#8211;the Christie homage that also reveals Bruce&#8217;s newfound self-awareness:\u00a0<em>if I love you, I&#8217;ll hurt you if I can</em>.</p>\n<p>Expressed by his narrator, the key lines (Bruce&#8217;s key lines are almost always in the bridge): <em>one does things I don&#8217;t understand, makes me feel like half a man.</em> (Clever wordplay, that last part.)</p>\n<p>With the villain now fully revealed, the struggle continues.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>At night I get down on my knees and pray</em><br />\n<em>Our love will make that other man go away</em><br />\n<em>But he&#8217;ll never say goodbye</em><br />\n<em>Two faces have I</em></p>\n<p>Bruce has credited his wife&#8217;s love, patience, and understanding as foundational and essential to his ability to rise above his darker nature (although it wasn&#8217;t the wife he had at the time he wrote &#8220;Two Faces&#8221;). Even so, I suspect from Bruce&#8217;s more recent writings that he&#8217;d admit that other man never did say goodbye. That struggle likely continues to this day.</p>\n<p>But the song isn&#8217;t over yet&#8211;and atypically for Bruce, it&#8217;s about to take a turn for the brighter.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Last night as I kissed you &#8216;neath the willow tree</em><br />\n<em>He swore he&#8217;d take your love away from me</em><br />\n<em>He said our life was just a lie</em><br />\n<em>And two faces have I</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well go ahead and let him try</em></p>\n<p>&#8220;Two Faces&#8221; ends with what I believe must be an intentional set of parallels. On the album, the song is paired with &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/02/06/roll-of-the-dice-brilliant-disguise/\">Brilliant Disguise</a>,&#8221; which immediately follows &#8220;Two Faces&#8221; as if they were opposite sides of a coin.</p>\n<p>They might well be.</p>\n<p>Both songs feature a symbolic willow tree. In &#8220;Two Faces,&#8221; our lovers kiss while our narrator&#8217;s darker half awaits his moment.\u00a0 When we listen to &#8220;Brilliant Disguise&#8221; immediately after, we wonder whether the latter song&#8217;s narrator might in fact be the same person, whether the voice that calls his lover&#8217;s name might be his other face rather than another man.</p>\n<p>But that&#8217;s not the only parallel: both songs end in a partial verse&#8211;a tactic Bruce uses to occasional and profound effect, playing with our expectations to leave us on an unsettled note. In &#8220;Two Faces,&#8221; it&#8217;s a simple <em>well go ahead and let him try&#8211;</em>a line of confidence and bravado undercut by its incompletion, its lack of a paired rhyme.</p>\n<p>It tells us that while our narrator may be confident in this moment, he&#8217;ll need to be on guard against his darker half forever. Because he will try.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>&#8220;Two Faces&#8221; made its live premiere not during the Tunnel of Love Express Tour, as is commonly believed, but at a surprise Halloween gig at McLoone&#8217;s Rum Runner in Sea Bright in 1987. Bruce and the band took to the stage in disguise that night, billing themselves as The Terrorists of Love and playing a mostly party-themed set.</p>\n<p>Strangely enough, sandwiched into an encore that included &#8220;Born to Run,&#8221; &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/11/09/matr-john-fogerty-and-bruce-springsteen-fortunate-son/\">Fortunate Son</a>,&#8221; &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/11/29/cover-me-lucille/\">Lucille</a>,&#8221; and &#8220;Twist and Shout&#8221; was the unlikely world debut of &#8220;Two Faces.&#8221;</p>\n<!--[if lt IE 9]><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\">document.createElement('audio');</script><![endif]-->\n<audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-34887-1\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1987-10-31-Two-Faces.mp3?_=1\" /><a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1987-10-31-Two-Faces.mp3\">https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1987-10-31-Two-Faces.mp3</a></audio>\n<p>(The crowd didn&#8217;t sound particularly impressed, but given the circumstances I can understand why.
