<p>On the Born to Run Tour, one of the more frequent covers (performed 13 times) was “Sha La La,” originally released by The Shirelles. Here’s a terrific recording of Bruce’s final performance of it on that tour, in Philadelphia on December 28, 1975:</p>

<p>Bruce clearly modeled his take on “Sha La La” after Manfred Mann’s 1964 version (which hit #3 in the UK, #12 in the US).</p>

<p>…but Manfred Mann’s version was actually the second released recording of the song. “Sha La La” was actually first recorded and released seven months earlier by The Shirelles, and it’s a much more swinging version than either of the ones by the boys.</p>
