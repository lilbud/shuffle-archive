meta-description: Sonny Day’s version of “Saving Up” is the definitive one, even if it’s an obscure cover of an obscure song (unless you’re from Auckland, in which case it’s a classic).

It’s obscure covers week here on the Shuffle. First, we had “” by , but at least Bruce officially released that song. Today’s entry can’t even claim that.

If you don’t hail from New Zealand, perhaps you’re not familiar with the late, great Sonny Day. (I wasn’t until this song.)

Day was a staple of the New Zealand rock, blues, and soul scene for decades, even though his recordings were infrequent.

Day’s biggest hit came in 1985, with a cover of Bruce Springsteen’s “.”

[Savin’ Up](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/05/14/roll-of-the-dice-cover-me-clarence-clemons-savin-up/)

“Savin’ Up” was as obscure then as it is now–it’s only other appearance on an album is its original 1983 outing by Clarence Clemons and the Red Bank Rockers. I don’t know if Day had a connection to either Bruce or Clarence, but somehow the song came to his attention.

Day covered the song in the studio with the All Stars, a group of accomplished Auckland session musicians, and filmed a video on the streets of Auckland. Check it out:

Yes, it’s about as eighties as you can get, but it’s a fantastic performance that’s so true to the Springsteen sound that I’d nominate Day’s version as the definitive recording of the song.
