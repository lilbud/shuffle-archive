<p>“All Along the Watchtower” is firmly embedded in the popular consciousness in two stellar versions–Bob Dylan’s 1967 original…</p>

<p>…and Jimi Hendrix’s 1968 cover, which not only became a huge hit at the time (his highest-ever single at #20 on the Hot 100) but also endured the test of time, landing in the Grammy Hall of Fame and notching in the upper echelons of <em>Rolling Stone</em>‘s 500 Greatest Songs of All Time at #47.</p>

<p>If you’re a rock fan, you recognize “All Along the Watchtower” from its opening notes. And if you’re a rock star, you can’t resist taking a turn at that legendary guitar solo–a temptation that occasionally leads to some epic cover performances.</p>
<p>Case in point: October 5, 2004, when Neil Young joined Bruce on stage in St. Paul during the Vote for Change Tour for an intense duet and jam that ranks (in my estimation, at least) among Bruce’s very best team-ups.</p>

<p>That performance attracted a lot of attention then and since, but just weeks later, Bruce played “All Along the Watchtower” again (and for the last time to date)–this time with Exit 105 at Joe Grushecky’s Flood Aid concert in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>This time, Bruce had the solo spotlight to himself, and he took full advantage of it, turning in one of his longest and most intense guitar solos of the post-Reunion era.</p>
<p>Make sure to watch this epic-length performance, too–both capture outstanding Springsteen performances of a classic he covers all too rarely.</p>
