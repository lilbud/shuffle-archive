I knew it wouldn&#8217;t happen in Portland. And after the short (by Bruce&#8217;s standards) and predictable show in Portland two days prior<span class=\"text_exposed_show\">, I really wasn&#8217;t expecting much out of Seattle. And going into the show, I was at peace with that.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"text_exposed_show\">At the time, I&#8217;d planned for the Seattle show to be my last of the tour (the extension legs hadn&#8217;t yet been announced). Since Seattle is my adopted home town, I opted for a suite at KeyArena, where I could enjoy the show in comfort with great friends, and all I really wanted was one last chance to take in those gorgeous River songs.</span></p>\n<p>(Sharing a pro tip: I&#8217;m sure mileage varies, but at many arenas (KeyArena included), the per-person cost for a suite is surprisingly only a small premium above the price of a standard ticket. When I can pull together a group of 16, I often throw in for a suite. It&#8217;s certainly not the high-adrenaline pit experience, but the view is excellent and unobstructed, the seating is comfy, and it&#8217;s nice to have a private bar and restroom.)</p>\n<div class=\"text_exposed_show\">\n<p>So I was completely unprepared for what I witnessed that night: a 3 hour and 45 minute barnburner featuring a second set comprised almost *entirely* of sign requests (Bruce had hardly done any up until this point on the tour, and none for the previous 5 shows before Seattle); a &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/06/19/roll-of-the-dice-bobby-jean/\">Bobby Jean</a>&#8221; guest-spot by Eddie Vedder; lots of ad-libbed and improvised takes on tour standards (including a hilarious almost-train-wreck during &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/02/02/roll-of-the-dice-crush-on-you/\">Crush on You</a>&#8221; that seemed to be the inflection point of the show but sadly wasn&#8217;t captured on youtube), a first-time-for-me performance of &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/06/05/roll-of-the-dice-im-goin-down/\">I&#8217;m Goin&#8217; Down</a>,&#8221; a stunning duet of &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/08/08/roll-of-the-dice-tougher-than-the-rest/\">Tougher Than the Rest</a>,&#8221; and a final &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/09/12/cover-me-shout/\">Shout</a>&#8221; that seemed like it would never end.</p>\n<p>It was, by far, the best show of the tour to date (IMO), in the place I least expected to find it. This was my ninth show of tour, and I thought it would be last&#8230; but after that show, I just couldn&#8217;t stop.</p>\n<p>I had to do one more.</p>\n<p>Or maybe seven.</p>\n<div
