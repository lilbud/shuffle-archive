Mark Lavengood is no stranger to covering Bruce Springsteen–his bluegrass cover of "[Hungry Heart](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/12/21/roll-of-the-dice-hungry-heart/)" from three years ago is well worth seeking out.

But his new dobro-centric cover of "[Born in the U.S.A.](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/09/21/roll-of-the-dice-born-in-the-u-s-a/)" from his recent tour is even better, and luckily for us, he's released an official tour compilation video that uses that song as its soundtrack.

Take a look and listen to Lavengood's terrific adaptation of one of Bruce's most iconic songs.
