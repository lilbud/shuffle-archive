<p>He tried different styles, from reggae…</p>

<p>…to a more straightforward ballad (around the 1:45 mark above). There’s something familiar about that last melody–if it remind you just a bit of another song in the first couple of lines, then listen to attempt #3, and the first couple of lines should jump right out at you:</p>

<p>Yep, those lines:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Til the sun is torn from the sky<br/>
Til every river, baby, it runs dry.</em></p>
<p>are the genetic ancestor of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/04/06/roll-of-the-dice-janey-dont-you-lose-heart/">Janey, Don’t You Lose Heart</a>.” The last lines of that song are:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>‘Til every river, baby, it runs dry</em><br/>
<em>Until the sun, honey, is torn from the sky</em></p>
<p>Bruce recorded these demos in early 1982, and reportedly the E Street Band took a crack at at in 1983. Maybe someday we’ll get to hear what they came up with.</p>
