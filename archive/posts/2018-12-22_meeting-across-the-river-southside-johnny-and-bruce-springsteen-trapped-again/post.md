Bruce has gifted several songs to Southside Johnny over the years, but he also contributed in small ways on songs that Southside wrote himself.

Case in point: “Trapped Again,” a Southside Johnny composition from 1978, but one that that contains “bits and pieces” from Bruce and Steve (including Steve’s backing vocals).

Somehow, though, despite all the times they’ve performed together, it took Bruce and Southside more than two decades to finally play “Trapped Again” together–and that performance remains the one and only time Bruce has played the song.

Listen to that performance here, from Bruce’s guest appearance at Southside’s show at The Stone Pony on May 27, 2001:
