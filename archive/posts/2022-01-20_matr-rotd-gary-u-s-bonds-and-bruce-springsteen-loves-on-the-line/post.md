*On the Line* is the great Springsteen pop album that never was.

Both Gary U.S. Bonds’ 1982 album and its immediate predecessor *Dedication* were produced by Bruce and Steven Van Zandt, and both albums are full of glorious, original Springsteen River-era pop songs.

Both albums spawned Springsteen-penned hit singles (“[This Little Girl](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/09/06/rotd-matr-cover-me-gary-u-s-bonds-bruce-springsteen-the-e-street-band-this-little-girl/)” from *Dedication* and “[Out of Work](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/04/18/rotd-matr-gary-u-s-bonds-bruce-springsteen-and-the-e-street-band-out-of-work/)” from *On the Line*), but they were only the tip of the iceberg of ridiculously great compositions given away by Bruce to Bonds.

In fact, *On the Line* contains a whopping *seven* original Springsteen songs, many of which feature Bruce and the E Street Band performing on the studio tracks. Six of the seven are hand-clappingly poppy, infectiously danceable party songs, but one of them stops listeners dead in their tracks: the devastating, heart-breaking “Love’s on the Line.”

“Love’s on the Line” is the album’s centerpiece, and its emotional rawness comes out of nowhere. It’s a song that resonates with any couple that can see the light at the end of the child-raising tunnel but isn’t sure anymore who their partner will be come daylight.

*Tell me baby*  
*Have we lost everything that we had before*  
*What do you do in the day*  
*When I walk out the door*  
*I can see you made up your mind*  
*And I know our love’s on the line*

*Love’s on the line, our love’s on the line*  
*Love’s on the line, our love’s on the line*  
*Love’s on the line, our love’s on the line*

There’s trouble in paradise from the outset. Our narrator knows that he and his partner have grown distant, and what’s more: he suspects his wife has already passed the point of no return.

But if the verses of “Love’s on the Line” are brooding and contemplative, the four-word chorus (featuring Bruce prominently on backing vocals) is a cry of anguish. Bruce plays on the meaning of “on the line”–we’re meant to hear it as “at stake,” as if their love is still salvageable. However, a closer listen reveals a deeper meaning: their love has flatlined. They’re just going through the motions. And with love faded, dissatisfaction and distrust set in.

*With each passing day*  
*I gotta watch more and more what I say to you*  
*I can feel your eyes looking through me*  
*As I sit at the table at dinnertime*  
*I can feel our love’s on the line*

*Love’s on the line, our love’s on the line*  
*Love’s on the line, our love’s on the line*  
*Love’s on the line, our love’s on the line*

What’s fascinating about this verse is how Bruce abandons his rhyme scheme, as if the narrator is so caught up in his thoughts he forgets he’s singing.

There’s a gorgeously wistful nostalgic E Street instrumental break here–one of the best on record, in fact. (But while one would be forgiven for assuming that’s the Big Man on saxophone, it’s actually Joey Stann’s solo.)

Bruce’s last verse shreds on its own power, but Gary absolutely nails his vocals, heightening the tension and escalating the emotion in what may be my favorite Bonds’ performance on record. I’m not sure Bruce could have matched its potency if he’d released his own version.

*I watch our kids*  
*Growin’ up, going to school*  
*Is there anything else for us now*  
*Are we both just fools*  
*Wasting our precious time*

*At night we lay in bed*  
*But it’s like you’re not even there*  
*There’s something real bad*  
*Going wrong somewhere*  
*Last night I heard you cry*  
*And I know our love’s on the line*

“Love’s on the Line” is a true hidden gem, one of Bruce’s best River-era compositions and one of Bonds’ finest performances. It flies under the radar, but it’s a song and an album that should be in any fan’s collection.
