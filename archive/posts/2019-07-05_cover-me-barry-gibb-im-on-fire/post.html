It was so good that even Barry Gibb was blown away by it. (Don’t take my word for it, though.)</p>

<p>So when Barry kicked off his own American tour a few months later, he decided to repay the favor.</p>
<p>At his tour opener (and at many of the shows thereafter), Barry’s set included a cover of Bruce’s 1985 hit, “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/09/11/roll-of-the-dice-im-on-fire/">I’m on Fire</a>.” Here’s his performance from Chicago, on May 27, 2014:</p>

<p>I suspect Barry chose the song to show off that famous falsetto of his, and based on the crowd’s reaction it was an inspired choice.</p>
