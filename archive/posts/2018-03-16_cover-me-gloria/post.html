<p>“Gloria” is a riff-rock classic that’s perfectly suited for the E Street Band’s guitar-heavy arsenal. It’s turned up in Bruce’s setlist more than a dozen times over the years, and that’s <em>not</em> including its frequent mini-appearance as a lead-in to “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/04/04/roll-of-the-dice-shes-the-one/">She’s the One</a>.” It’s clearly a significant song for Bruce, as you can hear in this conversation between Bruce and Steve from the Underground Garage in 2011.</p>

<p>Bruce may have bought the single on instinct, but as he says as above, “When that hit, once that hit, if you couldn’t play it, you didn’t get a gig.”</p>
<p>So play it they did. There are plenty of video clips to choose from, but I’m partial to this one from a few years ago–it’s nice and close up, with great audio.</p>
