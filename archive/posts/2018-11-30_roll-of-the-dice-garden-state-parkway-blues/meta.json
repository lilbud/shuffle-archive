Bruce never recorded the song in the studio (that we know of), but we&#8217;re fortunate enough to have a wonderful quality recording of a Steel Mill performance from 1970 to use as reference.</p>\n<p>If you have the time, start by listening to the entire song and see how many other songs you hear echoes of.</p>\n<div id=\"v-K8rRLDke-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='426' src='https://videopress.com/embed/K8rRLDke?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>We start with a casual riff, before Vini&#8217;s powerful drums kick in around 0:45, and the rest of the band shortly after.

It is\u00a0<em>extremely\u00a0</em>likely that it was at least a subconscious influence, and almost certainly an overt one.)</p>\n<p>Seriously, take a listen:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Vitamin B1, Niacin</em><br />\n<em>Five percent iron, how can I help but win?</em><br />\n<em>My very best friend, when I get up in the morning</em><br />\n<em>Whoa my Kellogs Corn Flakes are my very best friend</em><br />\n<em>And I don&#8217;t have to look very hard</em><br />\n<em>&#8216;Cause right inside&#8217;s your very special 3D baseball card</em></p>\n<p>(Hey, I didn&#8217;t say &#8220;Garden State Parkway Blues&#8221; was remarkable for its literary depth, did I?

It&#8217;ll be back, but first we have the introduction of our theme, and the next instance of Bruce wearing an influence on his sleeve.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>I got the Garden State Parkway Blues</em><br />\n<em>Early in the morning, gets you without warning</em><br />\n<em>Going to the job, fighting off the road hogs</em><br />\n<em>Punch in at nine, punch out at five\u00a0</em><br />\n<em>Punch in at nine, punch out at five</em><br />\n<em>Punch in at nine, punch out at five</em><br />\n<em>Punch in at nine, punch out at five</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>But boss he thinks I&#8217;m crazy</em><br />\n<em>And says &#8220;Son, why are you so lazy?</em><br />\n<em>And if you won&#8217;t leave me alone, I&#8217;m gonna mosey on home</em><br />\n<em>Ain&#8217;t no, yes, no, no son of a bitch&#8221;</em><br />\n<em>Punch in at nine, punch out at five</em><br />\n<em>Punch in at nine, punch out at five</em><br />\n<em>Punch in at nine, punch out at five</em><br />\n<em>Punch in at nine, punch out at five</em><br />\n<em>Punch in at nine, punch out at five</em><br />\n<em>Punch in at nine, punch out at five</em><br />\n<em>Punch in at nine, punch out at five</em><br />\n<em>Punch in at nine, punch out at five</em><br />\n<em>Punch in at nine, punch out at five</em></p>\n<p>Bruce clearly had nightmares about nine-to-five work even then. But beyond the context, does the increasingly manic and desperate escalation of the &#8220;punch in at nine, punch out at five&#8221; remind you of another song?</p>\n<p>Take a listen to another contemporary hit around the time Bruce wrote &#8220;Garden State Parkway Blues.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Napoleon XIV: &#039;They&#039;re coming to take me away&#039;\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hnzHtm1jhL4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re Coming to Take Me Away, Ha-Haaa!&#8221; was a 1966 novelty hit, peaking at #3 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #1 on the Cash Box Top 100. It&#8217;s likely Bruce had it in mind when writing (and certainly performing) this segment of the song. (That&#8217;s drummer Vini Lopez really getting into character on the backing vocals.)</p>\n<p>At the six-minute mark, the song transforms again. Now, we&#8217;re in a cool jazz club, and Bruce resumes the blues:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Well I work all day, I make terrible pay</em><br />\n<em>I get home and I just can&#8217;t get to sleep</em><br />\n<em>Yeah my woman gives me something, Lord, that got my mind hummin&#8217;</em><br />\n<em>Oh but it don&#8217;t work I&#8217;m just too weak</em><br />\n<em>I got electric bills, doctor bills, baby bills, I don&#8217;t know</em><br />\n<em>Just about everything but a\u00a0dollar bill</em></p>\n<p>(that&#8217;s a pretty clever line)</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>And I haven&#8217;t even paid my rent yet</em><br />\n<em>I got 12 more payments on my car</em><br />\n<em>Six more on the guitar\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>(a bit of a meta moment)</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Yeah now my mama wants a new dress, ah what a damn mess</em><br />\n<em>Don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m gonna do</em><br />\n<em>But I&#8217;m sick and tired of hearin&#8217; about all that damn bills</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;m tired about worrying about it</em><br />\n<em>They&#8217;re goin&#8217; to hell</em><br />\n<em>Yeah!</em><br />\n<em>Alright</em><br />\n<em>Hey!</em></p>\n<p>And now we&#8217;re in our second major jam. Listen carefully, though, and you&#8217;ll hear more faint echoes of a\u00a0 future classic, especially around the 8:50 mark.</p>\n<p>Another change-up comes our way now:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Well I don&#8217;t know where I&#8217;m goin&#8217; and I don&#8217;t understand but that&#8217;s alright</em><br />\n<em>Because the only thing I feel is the touch of your hand in the night</em><br />\n<em>Cars on the parkway they pull up and stare</em><br />\n<em>Ask where I&#8217;m goin&#8217; and I tell &#8217;em that I&#8217;m there</em><br />\n<em>Yeah, and I just don&#8217;t even care</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>The people I meet are all hip to the latest scene</em><br />\n<em>They sit around reading Rolling Stone magazine</em></p>\n<p>(That&#8217;s a remarkably early reference to\u00a0<em>Rolling Stone&#8211;</em>the magazine only debuted barely two years before this performance.)</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>I ask how they can sit so sweetly serene</em><br />\n<em>While there&#8217;s thousands of places that they have never seen</em><br />\n<em>Oh they have never been</em><br />\n<em>Goin&#8217; back, goin&#8217; back, goin&#8217; back</em></p>\n<p>That whole passage, by the way&#8211;from &#8220;cars on the parkway&#8221; through\u00a0 &#8220;they have never seen&#8221;&#8211;is\u00a0<em>very\u00a0</em>reminiscent of another <em>Sgt.

Bruce uses it to take us home, his lyrics transforming from the mundane to the romantic (with some very, um, strong vocals from Vini accompanying him):</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Gonna take it one more time around</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Well he gets up in the morning as the sun&#8217;s about to rise</em><br />\n<em>and with his guitar singing he goes down upon the green hillside</em><br />\n<em>He sings about a land he said he seen where there&#8217;s never any night</em><br />\n<em>And sunlight soldiers dance and sing before your very eyes</em><br />\n<em>Sing it to me!</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>(Well his father is the sun and his mother is the sky, yeah)</em><br />\n<em>(And today he&#8217;s to be wed to the wind, he knows not to reason why)</em><br />\n<em>For he is the mountain child</em><br />\n<em>For he is the mountain child</em><br />\n<em>Yeah, yeaaaah, yeah yeah yeah yeah</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>In his cloudy chariot he takes his brand new bride</em><br />\n<em>On into the house of stone down upon the green hillside</em><br />\n<em>There they stay for a year and a day, hands held side by side</em><br />\n<em>They&#8217;ll conceive of a daughter who&#8217;ll be the rain to clean your dusty mind</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>And when the dew has fallen down upon the earthy home</em><br />\n<em>They&#8217;ll set the sail on a clipper ship, never to return</em><br />\n<em>On into the blood red horizon where the fire of love still burns</em><br />\n<em>And the beauty of the perfect love will turn and turn and turn</em><br />\n<em>And the beauty of the perfect love will turn and turn and turn</em><br />\n<em>You know the beauty of the perfect love turn and turn and turn</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>He gets up in the morning as the sun&#8217;s about to rise</em><br />\n<em>And with his guitar singing he go down upon the green hillside</em><br />\n<em>Sings about a land he said he seen where there&#8217;s never any night</em><br />\n<em>And sunlight soldiers dance and sing before your very eyes</em><br />\n<em>And sunlight soldiers dance and sing before your very eyes</em><br />\n<em>And sunlight soldiers dance dance dance before your very eyes</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Na na na na na na&#8230;
