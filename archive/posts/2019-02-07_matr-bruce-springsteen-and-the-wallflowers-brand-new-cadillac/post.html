<p>And then almost <em>another</em> twenty years on, Bruce Springsteen and The Wallflowers put their own spin on it when Bruce joined the band on stage at their gig at Tradewinds in Sea Bright, New Jersey.</p>
<p>For a man almost a year-and-a-half into a solo acoustic tour, Bruce seriously rocks it–it sounds like he’s having a blast.</p>
<p>From March 8, 1997, take a listen to Bruce and The Wallflowers tear it up on “Brand New Cadillac.”</p>
