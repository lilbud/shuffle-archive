<p>Bruce was bound to cover “Hound Dog” sooner or later. Hasn’t everybody?</p>
<p>Well, maybe not <em>everybody</em>, but known recordings of “Hound Dog” number in the hundreds, starting with the best: Big Mama Thornton’s growling blues original from 1952.</p>

<p>That version commanded the top of the Billboard R&amp;B chart for seven weeks and is enshrined in both the Grammy Hall of Fame and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame’s 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll.</p>
<p>Four years later, Elvis Presley topped Thornton’s feat. His rockabilly cover topped the pop chart for 11 weeks (a record that would stand until 1992) and simultaneously held the #1 spot on the country and R&amp;B charts, too.</p>

<p>As for Bruce, he only covered it in concert, twice–both times in the summer of ’89, both times at The Stone Pony, and both times as a surprise guest appearance.</p>
<p>Bruce’s “Hound Dog” debut came on the evening of June 24, when he joined Bobby Bandiera on stage, whipping the crowd into a frenzied excitement during a teasing intro before finally launching into a hard-rocking arrangement.</p>

<p>Bruce’s second and last performance to date came 29 days later, when he joined Cats on a Smooth Surface, The Stone Pony’s house band, in one of his many “surprise” appearances.</p>
<p>And amazingly: this one was captured <em>on video</em>.</p>
