(Bruce had actually started including it in the set a few days prior.)</p>\n<p>Originally released in 1964, &#8220;Chimes of Freedom&#8221; is the tale of a thunderstorm, one that strikes with rage and ferocity before fading into the distance. As the singer waits out the storm, he imagines that the thunderclaps are the chiming bells of freedom, ushered in by the bolts of lightning representing the untold struggle for freedom in places both close to home and far-flung.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Chimes of Freedom\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LVIWA9VTiN8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;Chimes of Freedom&#8221; isn&#8217;t a protest song&#8211;it&#8217;s a song of solidarity, of brotherhood and sisterhood. It was a perfect anthem for a tour celebrating Human Rights, and it&#8217;s fitting that Bruce chose to record this performance and release it as the title track of an EP a month later to promote and support the upcoming tour. Performed in a bold, assertive arrangement, Bruce abbreviated (cutting two verses) and transformed the song into more of an anthem than a musing. Never released as a single, it nevertheless made it to #16 on the Billboard Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Chimes of Freedom (Live at Stockholms Olympiastadion, Stockholm, SE - July 1988)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WhvpFX63JGw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Bruce continued to perform &#8220;Chimes of Freedom&#8221; for the duration of the Tunnel of Love Tour, and when that tour segued into the Amnesty International Tour, he led the assembled artists in an all-star rendition.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen, Sting, Tracy Chapman, Peter Gabriel, Youssou N\u00b4Dour - Chimes Of Freedom\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TbEr240Tfsk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Bruce hasn&#8217;t performed the song since 1988, but he actually did perform it once long\u00a0<em>before</em>&#8211;on the Darkness Tour, way back in 1978.
