The band played over three dozen shows there between Labor Day and Christmas, but on this night they were joined by a guest player: Southside Johnny, no stranger to either the venue or the players, as they&#8217;d played together in various combinations for more than a year.</p>\n<p>Amazingly, their performance that night was captured on both audio and video, and while the video has unfortunately long since been destroyed, the audio provides us a great opportunity to hear our pre-fame heroes firing on all improvisational cylinders.</p>\n<p>In one of the set&#8217;s highlights, The Bruce Springsteen band kicks into a superbly cool rendition of Bruce&#8217;s original song, &#8220;The Band&#8217;s Just Boppin&#8217; the Blues,&#8221; of which only two performances are known to exist on bootleg audio. (This one is by far the superior performance, thanks to the Southside&#8217;s guest appearance.)</p>\n<div id=\"v-vioCata0-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='568' src='https://videopress.com/embed/vioCata0?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>Bruce obviously intended his title as a hat-tip to Carl Perkins, who had an almost-hit with &#8220;Boppin&#8217; the Blues&#8221; fifteen years earlier (and had recently re-recorded it with New Jersey based NRBQ).</p>\n<p>But apart from the title, &#8220;The Band&#8217;s Just Boppin&#8217; the Blues&#8221; has little in common with Carl Perkins&#8217; song.</p>\n<p>Bruce&#8217;s lyrics are simple and straightforward, and a comparison with the only other surviving audio of &#8220;The Band&#8217;s Just Boppin&#8217; the Blues&#8221; (a muddier-sounding performance from three months later) suggests that the piece was intended to be somewhat improvisational from the beginning, more of a band showcase (complete with in-song band intros) than a song with a message.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well it&#8217;s another Saturday night and you&#8217;re sitting at the bar all alone</em><br />\n<em>Well man you&#8217;re feeling kind of tired but you&#8217;re not tired enough to go home</em><br />\n<em>Well sit back and let loose because the band&#8217;s just boppin&#8217; the blues</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well it&#8217;s the same old singer, Ma, and I know that it&#8217;s the same old song</em><br />\n<em>And the band keeps on playing, band keeps playing all night long</em><br />\n<em>Well now I know it ain&#8217;t no use because the band&#8217;s just boppin&#8217; the blues</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Yeah I got Madman on the drums, and Mr. Dave right down to my left on the keys</em><br />\n<em>And when the man plays his guitar, it hits the little girls bad between the knees</em><br />\n<em>Oh, so just sit back and hang loose, the band&#8217;s just bopping the blues</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Oh you might dig boogie-woogie tunes or maybe you like to rock and roll</em><br />\n<em>But right now it&#8217;s all about the music, it saves me right down into my soul</em><br />\n<em>Ah well just sit back and hang loose because the band&#8217;s just bopping the blues</em></p>\n<p>And a showcase it was. The highlights of the performance are clearly the two instrumental breaks, the first one a spotlight for Southside Johnny&#8217;s impressive harp skills, the latter an extended jam centered around the amazing David Sancious.</p>\n<p>Flash forward exactly a year later, and Bruce would be one month into touring for his upcoming debut album, with the band that would eventually become known as E Street fully in place. But in November 1971, the action was all at the Student Prince, where a pre-fame Bruce Springsteen and his eponymous band spent their weekend nights just boppin&#8217; the blues.</p>\n<p><strong>The Band&#8217;s Just Boppin&#8217; the Blues<br />\nFirst performed:</strong> November 13, 1971 (Asbury Park, NJ)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> February 4, 1972 (Richmond, VA)</p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
