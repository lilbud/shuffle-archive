When I shared Joan Osborne and The Waybacks' [cover of "I'm Goin' Down"](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/05/15/cover-me-joan-osborne-and-the-waybacks-im-goin-down/) a few months ago, I promised it wouldn't be the last time I dip into this absolutely fantastic album.

So here's another reinvention of a classic Springsteen song, from a concert album full of them. *This* is how you put your own spin on another artist's song. Check out their version of "[Born in the U.S.A.](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/09/21/roll-of-the-dice-born-in-the-u-s-a/)"
