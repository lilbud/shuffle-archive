<p>When I shared Joan Osborne and The Waybacks’ <a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/05/15/cover-me-joan-osborne-and-the-waybacks-im-goin-down/">cover of “I’m Goin’ Down”</a> a few months ago, I promised it wouldn’t be the last time I dip into this absolutely fantastic album.</p>
<p>So here’s another reinvention of a classic Springsteen song, from a concert album full of them. <em>This</em> is how you put your own spin on another artist’s song.
