From the inside, it was magical. But it would be a few hours before I&#8217;d get to go inside, so in the meantime I sat outside in the piazza, had a pizza and a glass of wine, and listened to the soundcheck, which carried out in to the square with crystal clarity.</p>\n<p>It seemed we would be in for an eventful night&#8230; perhaps. Bruce is known to soundcheck songs that get performed a few nights later (or perhaps never) rather than that night. But &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/06/19/roll-of-the-dice-bobby-jean/\">Bobby Jean</a>&#8221; sounded spot on, too perfect not to play. And there was a song I didn&#8217;t recognize at all but that made reference to Samson and Delilah, and I knew that one had to be a Verona special.</p>\n<p>When the gates opened, I found a seat. If I recall correctly, the entire arena was GA by section, and I was seated at the far end of the arena on the stone steps. That was fine by me&#8211;I was glad just to be there. But by the time the show started (very late in the evening by American standards), I&#8217;d realized the downside of an ancient stone arena: I was sitting on ancient stone. No chairs, just rock, and my butt and my back were not happy after my long journey.</p>\n<p>Luckily, I&#8217;d be on my feet much of the night, because this was a tour filled with joyous musical celebrations, lifted high by a raucous Italian crowd.</p>\n<p>And yes: it was\u00a0<em>very</em> surreal to hear a crowd of Italian Springsteen fans sing note for note a collection of classic American folk songs that most Americans would be hard pressed to recognize, let alone sing along to.</p>\n<p>But it was also wonderful. This was my second and final show on the Seeger Sessions Tour, and it felt like my previous show in Glendale was a lot further back than a mere four months. The show had grown in length and power and spontaneity since then, and Bruce was having the time of his life.</p>\n<p>The show started with a trio of\u00a0<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/07/17/album-companion-we-shall-overcome/\"><em>We Shall Overcome</em></a> tracks, but then Bruce wasted no time introducing his first tour premiere (we would have four that night): &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/09/25/cover-me-samson-and-delilah/\">Samson and Delilah</a>,&#8221; the song I&#8217;d heard during the soundcheck. It was completely foreign to me then, but I learned afterward that it&#8217;s a traditional gospel song with a popular rendition by\u00a0<em>The Grateful Dead</em>. (I&#8217;ve never been a fan of that band, so I&#8217;m unfamiliar with most of their catalog.) Bruce&#8217;s arrangement was powerful, though, and the song was instantly one of the highlights of the evening.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - John Henry\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gQXJt2cE-8c?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Old Dan Tucker\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/S-GHbDFrwlU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen &amp; Seeger Sessions Band - Samson &amp; Delilah\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/37Ldb44KngI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Marc Anthony Thompson joined Bruce for their nightly &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/11/01/cover-me-eyes-on-the-prize/\">Eyes on the Prize</a>&#8221; duet, followed by &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/07/10/roll-of-the-dice-cover-me-jesse-james/\">Jesse James</a>,&#8221; and then &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/06/04/roll-of-the-dice-atlantic-city/\">Atlantic City</a>&#8221; became the first Springsteen original of the night.</p>\n<div id=\"v-Dd91MY0J-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='426' src='https://videopress.com/embed/Dd91MY0J?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>&#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/06/01/roll-of-the-dice-if-i-should-fall-behind/\">If I Should Fall Behind</a>&#8221; &#8212; that seemingly infinitely malleable and enduring ballad &#8212; was the second Bruce original, presented here in a waltz arrangement, while the crowd sang every note of the melody&#8211;even when there were no lyrics.</p>\n<p>Then came a double-shot highlight, the first of which was a jaw-dropping surprise: Bruce announced to the crowd (in Italian, but I could understand enough of it to get the gist) that Patti was leaving the tour and heading home to take care of the kids. This would be her last show, and so Bruce wanted to play one of her songs. They chose &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/12/13/matr-patti-scialfa-and-bruce-springsteen-valerie/\">Valerie</a>,&#8221; one of my favorite tracks from\u00a0<em>Rumble Doll</em>.</p>\n<p>Even as they began to play it, I couldn&#8217;t believe it was happening. I don&#8217;t think Bruce had ever inserted one of Patti&#8217;s songs into his own set list like that, other than a few bars during the band intros on the Reunion Tour.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Valerie&#8221; was perfect for the evening, and the memory of that performance in that venue on that night will last with me for a long time. I loved everything about that tour, but this may have been my single favorite moment.</p>\n<p>Bruce followed that surprise with another one: the tour premiere of &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/06/19/roll-of-the-dice-bobby-jean/\">Bobby Jean.</a>&#8221; I knew this was coming from the soundcheck, but I was thrilled he chose to play it.</p>\n<div id=\"v-xjDDu5Ri-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='426' src='https://videopress.com/embed/xjDDu5Ri?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>The rest of the main set matched my memory of my earlier Glendale show, but there was one notable exception: the addition of &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/03/04/roll-of-the-dice-the-river/\">The River,</a>&#8221; which had become a set list standard on the European leg, recast in an Irish-tinged arrangement. I&#8217;ve always argued that Bruce&#8217;s greatest talent&#8211;perhaps even more than songwriting&#8211;is his amazing gift for endlessly re-arranging and re-inventing. &#8220;The River&#8221; sounded fresh and vital.
