Greetings!

Just a quick note to draw your attention to our new "Search by Date" calendar widget, a request/suggestion offered by several of you.

It's particularly useful when searching for a particular *Kingdom of Days* post, as those are always posted on the date they describe.

You'll find it on the right navigation bar or at the bottom of each page, depending on your display device.

(Pro tip: you can also just type a date directly into the regular search bar–it's even faster. But the calendar widget is best for browsing multiple dates.)

Thanks again to those of you who have been sending in site improvement suggestions. I don't get nearly enough time to work on them (it's a challenge just keeping the content flowing each day), but I read them and act on them when opportunity presents itself.

Have a great day!

Ken
