<p>Just a quick note to draw your attention to our new “Search by Date” calendar widget, a request/suggestion offered by several of you.</p>
<p>It’s particularly useful when searching for a particular <em>Kingdom of Days</em> post, as those are always posted on the date they describe.</p>
<p>You’ll find it on the right navigation bar or at the bottom of each page, depending on your display device.</p>
<p>(Pro tip: you can also just type a date directly into the regular search bar–it’s even faster. But the calendar widget is best for browsing multiple dates.)</p>
<p>Thanks again to those of you who have been sending in site improvement suggestions. I don’t get nearly enough time to work on them (it’s a challenge just keeping the content flowing each day), but I read them and act on them when opportunity presents itself.</p>
<p>Have a great day!</p>
<p>Ken</p>
