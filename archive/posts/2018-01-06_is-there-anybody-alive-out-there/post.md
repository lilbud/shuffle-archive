Welcome!

Let’s get this out of the way: yes, this is yet Bruce Springsteen blog.

*another*

Does the world really need any more of them? Probably not.

So why am I writing this one? Mostly as an outlet for my own views and an opportunity to do some writing. I’m a historian, and I delve deep into any topic that fascinates me, so I’m hoping to use this platform as an opportunity to occasionally dig a little more deeply than most Springsteen books or articles.

It’s also an opportunity to open up my vault of rare Springsteen recordings, videos, photos, articles, and more. Once upon a time they seemed like currency in an underground trading community. But in the age of cell phones and torrents and “official bootlegs” streaming media, it’s easier to come by new shows, and I’d rather focus on sharing my collection and providing some context along with it.

So what should you expect to see here? To start, there will be three different series of postings:

- : Published daily, these are brief “On this Day in Bruce History” articles. More than anything else, it’s how I’ll open up my archives and share some really cool nuggets. Look for rare audio, photos, and articles here.
**Kingdom of Days**- : Published once or twice weekly (I’ll settle on a cadence once I see how much time they take), these are longer history and/or analysis pieces, each dedicated to a single Bruce Springsteen song. Why “Roll of the Dice?” Because after the first one, which I’ll post later today, I’ll be using a random generator to pick the song. (I’ll also entertain requests!)
**Roll of the Dice**- : Published whenever I feel like it, these are notable covers of Bruce Springsteen songs by other artists, or of other artists by Bruce.
**Cover Me**- Published whenever I feel like it, these are rare duets and guest performances with other artists.
**Meeting Across the River:**

…and I suspect that as things get rolling, other series ideas may come to mind.

In the meantime, please check out the first two posts (probably already live by the time you read this)–you’ll find, among other things, a recording of the very first performance of “Land of Hope and Dreams”–and come back tomorrow for another Kingdom of Days mini-archive.

And please share your comments, suggestions and feedback!

See you further on up the road!

Ken
