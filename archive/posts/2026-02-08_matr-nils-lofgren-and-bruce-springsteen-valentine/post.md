During the E Street Diaspora of the 1990s, the band members focused on their solo careers. Nils in particular was prolific during this period, releasing six albums over a period of only seven years, starting with in 1991 (Nils’ first album in five years).

If you wondered at the time whether the band’s friendships were able to survive the suspension of their professional relationships, you didn’t have to listen to very long to get your answer.

The second song on the album is Nils’ wonderful love song, “Valentine,” which sounds just as fresh and vibrant today as it did when it was first released. The song stands tall on its own, but watch the video below to see Nils beckon to an old friend just before the first chorus.

Bruce’s backing vocals added a layer of fraternity to the romantic lyrics, and by gosh it was good to see the two of them performing together again.

Here’s wishing you a day filled with love and friendship.

Here’s the album version of the song–audio only, but it includes a terrific extended guitar solo from Nils.
