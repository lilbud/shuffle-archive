<p>There was always a country song deep down in Bruce Springsteen’s “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/12/21/roll-of-the-dice-hungry-heart/">Hungry Heart</a>,” and Drew Holcomb and Tift Merritt found it back in 2017 when they appeared together on <a href="https://www.etown.org/broadcasts/drew-holcomb-neighbors-tift-merritt/">an episode of eTown</a>.</p>
<p>Skip past the first minute of rehearsal footage if you must, but don’t miss their gorgeous cover performance that follows–it’s one of my favorite covers of a Springsteen song.</p>

<p>When I first heard Holcomb and Merritt’s performance, it was a revelation—their arrangement of “Hungry Heart” feels so natural, so perfectly suited to the lyrics that I have to wonder whether Bruce ever envisioned it that way himself.</p>
