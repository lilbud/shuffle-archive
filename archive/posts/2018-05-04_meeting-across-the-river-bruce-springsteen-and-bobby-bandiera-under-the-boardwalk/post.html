<p>Here’s the first time Bruce played the The Drifters’ 1964 classic, with Bobby Bandiera at The Stone Pony on June 24, 1989.</p>

<p>“Under the Boardwalk” is a sequel of sorts to “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/12/15/cover-me-up-on-the-roof/">Up on the Roof</a>,” another gorgeous Drifters song that Bruce has covered a few times (but we’ll cover that another day). Here’s the original, but you almost certainly know it–the opening notes played on bass, gourd, and triangle are instantly recognizable.</p>

<p>Bruce covered “Under the Boardwalk” a few more times over the years. The last time was at a telethon for Hurricane Sandy relief–and it was a team-up as well, this time a bit more star-studded:</p>
