**1980:** Today is an emotional day for Bruce–John Lennon was murdered the night before, and Bruce has to muster up the composure and presence to perform. He opens his River Tour show in Philadelphia with a tribute to Lennon and goes on to play an intense show that features the tour premiere of both "[Rendezvous](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/05/08/roll-of-the-dice-rendezvous/)" and–fittingly–"Twist and Shout." This is a show worth listening to.
