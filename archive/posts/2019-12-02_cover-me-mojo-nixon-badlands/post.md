Thanks to Jason Luttrull for bringing this one to my attention!

I’m a big fan of Mojo Nixon’s cover of “” from his first album with Skid Roper, and I’ve long wished he’d take a run at another song from Bruce’s catalog.

Little did I know he’d already done so back in 1997–sort of.

Turns out that while rehearsing for his album in the studio, his rehearsal sessions included a rough cut of “,” The song never made it on the album, but it’s a bold, fresh (but still just as fierce) arrangement that deserves to be heard. Take a listen:
