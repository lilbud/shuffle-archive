Jimmy Cliff wrote “The Harder They Come” for the 1972 film by the same name (in which he played the starring role). The film’s soundtrack became an international success, raising the global profile of reggae music and establishing Cliff as a star.

“The Harder They Come” ranks squarely at #350 on Rolling Stone’s 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, and Cliff even performed it on during the show’s very first season–three years after the song was released.

Still, most Springsteen fans are probably more familiar with the song’s B-sides (both of them) than the A-side. On its first release, “The Harder They Come” was backed with “Many Rivers to Cross,” which Bruce performed regularly on World Tour 1993. On re-release, the single was backed by Cliff’s “Trapped,” which has been a fan favorite at Bruce’s shows for four decades.

Bruce did cover the A-side, though–once and once only, at a very special show.

In 2012, Bruce keynoted the SxSW festival in Austin, and afterward he played a full concert at Moody Theater with the E Street Band and a stellar array of guest artists. One of Bruce’s guests that night was Jimmy Cliff himself, and the two artists kicked off their three-song mini-set with Bruce’s one and only performance of “The Harder They Come.”

Fortunately, the venue was intimate enough that several filmers were able to preserve their performance for posterity. Here’s one of the best ones.
