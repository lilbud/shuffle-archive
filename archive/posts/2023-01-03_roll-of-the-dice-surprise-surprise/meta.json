And in my dreams these songs sound like the greatest songs I&#8217;ve ever written. I wake up, and I write some of these things down. And then I get up the next morning, and almost invariably all these songs are total shit! You think you&#8217;re great in your dream, but you&#8217;re not. For years, I&#8217;d write a song in my dreams, and in my dream I&#8217;m going &#8216;This is the one! This is the one that&#8217;ll make them forget Born to Run!&#8217; I get up, I write it down, and I get up the next morning and play it and it&#8217;s horrendous. But one song I wrote in my dream, and I got up the next morning and played it and it was good. There&#8217;s only been one in all of 45 years.&#8221; &#8212; Bruce Springsteen&#8217;s on-stage introduction to &#8220;Surprise, Surprise&#8221;, November 4, 2011</span></p></blockquote>\n<p>So&#8230; who&#8217;s gonna tell him?</p>\n<p>Because if &#8220;Surprise, Surprise&#8221; is the only &#8220;good&#8221; song to come out of Bruce&#8217;s dreams, I&#8217;m glad he never recorded the others.</p>\n<p>(Bruce may be prone to on-stage exaggeration at times, but this is one story I believe one hundred percent.)</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Surprise, Surprise\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yEIBlkh4AsM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Its glorious Byrdsian production and harmonies may somewhat redeem it, but lyrically &#8220;Surprise, Surprise&#8221; is as slight as they come.\u00a0 Heck, we&#8217;re a quarter of the way through the song before Bruce utters his eleventh non-repeating word, although he manages to get &#8220;surprise&#8221; out sixteen times in forty-five seconds, which is approaching &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/05/14/roll-of-the-dice-backstreets/\">Backstreets</a>&#8221; territory.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well surprise, surprise, surprise</em><br />\n<em>Yeah surprise, surprise, surprise</em><br />\n<em>Well surprise, surprise, come on open your eyes</em><br />\n<em>And let your love shine down</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well surprise, surprise, surprise</em><br />\n<em>Yeah surprise, surprise, surprise</em><br />\n<em>Well surprise, surprise, come on open your eyes</em><br />\n<em>And let your love shine down</em></p>\n<p>So we&#8217;re thinking: there&#8217;s gotta be more to the song than this, right?</p>\n<p>Well, yeah&#8230;. there are all of two verses:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well today is your birthday, we traveled so far we two</em><br />\n<em>So let&#8217;s blow out the candles on your cake and we&#8217;ll raise a glass or two</em><br />\n<em>And when the sun comes out tomorrow, it&#8217;ll be the start of a brand new day</em><br />\n<em>And all that you have wished for I know will come your way</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>In the hollow of the evening, as you lay your head to rest</em><br />\n<em>May the evening stars scatter a shining crown upon your breast</em><br />\n<em>In the darkness of the morning, as the sky struggles to light</em><br />\n<em>May the rising sun caress and bless your soul for all your life</em></p>\n<p>So Bruce dreamt he re-wrote &#8220;Happy Birthday to You&#8221; and now it&#8217;s on an album.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Happy Birthday&#8221; actually has more lyrics than most people realize. No one ever sings its second verse:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>From good friends and true,</em><br />\n<em>From old friends and new,</em><br />\n<em>May good luck go with you,</em><br />\n<em>And happiness too.</em></p>\n<p>&#8230;but if you compare the full lyrics to &#8220;Happy Birthday to You&#8221; with &#8220;Surprise, Surprise,&#8221; they are basically the same song. Bruce just uses more florid language.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s very beautiful language, mind you: I mean, who <em>wouldn&#8217;t</em> want a shining crown of stardust upon their breast? But still: Happy Birthday to You.</p>\n<p>Which isn&#8217;t to say that &#8220;Surprise, Surprise&#8221; can&#8217;t be very touching in the right context. For instance, on Little Steven&#8217;s birthday in 2009, when Bruce serenaded him with the song after presenting him with a birthday cake.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Springsteen &quot;Surprise Surprise&quot; Buffalo 11-22-09\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KADuwwUHbtU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>It also translates surprisingly well acoustically, primarily because Bruce is able to provide a more tender vocal when he doesn&#8217;t have to worry about being overpowered by the band.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen Surprise, Surprise Live at Hershey, PA 5-14-14  (Part 6)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pg_HcKbWbd4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Like I said, &#8220;Surprise, Surprise&#8221; is not without its redeeming values. But still: Happy Birthday to You.</p>\n<p>So let&#8217;s hope Bruce can turn his brain off at night and sleep peacefully.
