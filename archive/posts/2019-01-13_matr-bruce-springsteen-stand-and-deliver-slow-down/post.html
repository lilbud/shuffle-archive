<p>“Slow Down” was considered to be an R&amp;B single, but it hit the radar and captured the imagination of emerging rock artists like the Young Rascals, and of course The Beatles.</p>

<p>Bruce has never covered “Slow Down” in concert, but he did perform it once, in the unlikeliest of venues: at the now-defunct Classics Cafe in Westwood, New Jersey in 1994. What brought Bruce to the Cafe is unbeknownst to me, but once there he took the opportunity to join cover band Stand and Deliver for six songs, including Bruce’s one-and-only performance of “Slow Down.” It’s loose, fun, and although Bruce doesn’t contribute vocals, he sure seems to be having fun on guitar.</p>
