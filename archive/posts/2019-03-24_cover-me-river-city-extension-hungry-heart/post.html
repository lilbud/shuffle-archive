<p>I’m not sure that Bruce’s “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/12/21/roll-of-the-dice-hungry-heart/">Hungry Heart</a>” lyrics are well-served by this cool arrangement by River City Extension… but then again, I’m not sure that Bruce’s own arrangement works particularly well either.</p>
<p>“Hungry Heart” has always generated some cognitive dissonance with its pop melody welded to lyrics of familial abandonment.</p>
<p>So how about we just give a hall pass to anyone who wants to try something new when covering it, because this cover groove by the now-defunct River City Extension out of Toms River (barely a half-hour drive from Asbury Park) is too great to fault for style.</p>
<p>Play it over your Sunday morning coffee–that’s what I’m doing right now.</p>
