<p>This morning, though, friend (and copy editor) of the blog Lori Pierce suggested that <em>maybe</em> it was time, and that was just the nudge I needed. (Thanks, Lori!)</p>
<p>So if you’re interested in seeing what other artists do with Bruce’s songs (and my blog stats suggest you might be), check out our <a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/cover-index/">new index of cover songs</a> profiled on this site. I add new covers every week, and I’ll update the inbox each time I do.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: I’ve only included Bruce’s songs covered by other artists; indexing the inverse is a project for another day.</p>
<p>As always, thanks for reading, commenting, following, and sharing. I hope you stick with me as I work my way through Bruce’s entire catalog of originals and covers–we’re almost 800 in, just about at the halfway point.</p>
<p>Lots more to come!</p>
