I’ve been meaning to get the sprawling *Cover Me* section of the blog under control for a while now, but work, life, etc.

This morning, though, friend (and copy editor) of the blog Lori Pierce suggested that *maybe* it was time, and that was just the nudge I needed. (Thanks, Lori!)

So if you’re interested in seeing what other artists do with Bruce’s songs (and my blog stats suggest you might be), check out our [new index of cover songs](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/cover-index/) profiled on this site. I add new covers every week, and I’ll update the inbox each time I do.

**Note**: I’ve only included Bruce’s songs covered by other artists; indexing the inverse is a project for another day.

As always, thanks for reading, commenting, following, and sharing. I hope you stick with me as I work my way through Bruce’s entire catalog of originals and covers–we’re almost 800 in, just about at the halfway point.

Lots more to come!
