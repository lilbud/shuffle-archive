<p>Nineteen years later, they reintroduced themselves to the world at the same time, too. In March 1992, Bruce released his <em>Human Touch </em>and <em>Lucky Town</em> albums after a five-year absence. Garland returned to record stores as well, with his first album in nine years.</p>
<p>Garland’s reception was much more muted than Bruce’s, but <em>Don’t Call Me Buckwheat </em>still garnered critical acclaim for Jeffreys’ exploration of race relations and tension in America.</p>
<p>None of the album’s singles charted in America, but “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/03/13/matr-garland-jeffreys-and-bruce-springsteen-hail-hail-rock-n-roll/">Hail Hail Rock ‘n’ Roll</a>” was a minor hit in several European countries, and a follow-up single of “Welcome to the World” managed to crack the Top 100 in the Netherlands.</p>

<p>“Welcome to the World” is one of the album’s most overt pieces of social commentary. It seemed a fitting yet optimistic choice for the set list when Bruce invited Garland to join him for his run of Asbury Park holiday benefit concerts a few months after the events of 9/11.</p>
<p>Garland played it each night of the run (except for one show he missed), and during his performance December 6th, Bruce joined him at the mic to take a verse. Take a listen below.</p>

<p>Bruce and Garland would go on to perform together fifteen times over the next fifteen years, but never again (to date, at least) would they play “Welcome to the World.”</p>
