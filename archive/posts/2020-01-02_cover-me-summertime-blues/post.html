<p>With one of the most recognizable riffs in rock and roll and lyrics aimed right at rock’s core audience, it’s no wonder that “Summertime Blues” became a monster hit when rockabilly legend Eddie Cochran released it in the summer (appropriately) of 1958.</p>

<p>That novelty bass vocal didn’t hurt either–and amazingly, Cochran sings that part as well. Originally released as a B-side, “Summertime Blues” went on to peak at #8 on the Hot 100, #73 on <em>Rolling Stone’s</em> 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, and is today enshrined in the Grammy Hall of Fame. Had he not died at the young age of 21, who knows how high Cochran’s star might have risen–he was an outstanding musician and a confident stage performer, as this rare live video attests:</p>

<p>“Summertime Blues” is a blues in lyrics only–the infectious backing track defies any attempt to empathize with the song’s narrator. That’s a device that Bruce Springsteen loves to employ, so it’s no wonder that he added it to his set lists relatively early in his career.</p>
<p>Here’s his first-ever performance: the opening number for his Darkness Tour show in Miami in the summer of 1978, with The Big Man doing the honors on the bass vocal:</p>

<p>Okay, I admit that’s a terrible recording, but I presented it for historical purposes. Here’s a better one–caught on video just a couple of weeks later in Washington, DC.</p>

<p>“Summertime Blues” made frequent outings throughout the summer and fall of 1978, and it made an encore appearance on the River Tour in the summer of 1981. But it would be more than a quarter-century before fans would hear the E Street Band play it again, when it made a welcome return during the final months of the Magic Tour.</p>

<p>Since then, “Summertime Blues” can be counted on to make a few cameo appearances on an E Street Band Tour–in fact, it hasn’t missed a tour since its 21st century debut on the Magic Tour.</p>

<p>“Summertime Blues” is a reliable singalong crowd-pleaser, almost always appearing early in the set–and if you’re lucky enough to get it, you’ll know you’re going to be in for a loose, fun evening.</p>

<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> Although Bruce didn’t perform “Summertime Blues” with the E Street Band between the River and Magic Tours, he did play it once with Beaver Brown at Big Man’s West during Memorial Day Weekend in 1982. It’s an incredibly high-energy performance, and although the sound quality isn’t pristine, it’s still my all-time favorite performance of the song. It rarely circulates but deserves a listen–enjoy.</p>
