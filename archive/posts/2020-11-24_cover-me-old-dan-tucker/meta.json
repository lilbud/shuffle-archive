Bruce convened a recording session at his home with The Gotham Playboys, a group of musicians he&#8217;d met through Soozie Tyrell, who joined the players along with Patti Scialfa and the Miami Horns.</p>\n<p>In all, there were twelve musicians there that day, and never before had they all played together. And yet they clicked, recording not just &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/08/15/roll-of-the-dice-cover-me-we-shall-overcome/\">We Shall Overcome</a>&#8221; (which ended up as Bruce&#8217;s contribution for the tribute album) but also &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/03/04/cover-me-my-oklahoma-home/\">My Oklahoma Home</a>,&#8221; &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/07/10/roll-of-the-dice-cover-me-jesse-james/\">Jesse James</a>,&#8221; and two songs that remain unreleased to this day.</p>\n<p>In recent years, Bruce has become much freer in his recording style (most notably recording <em>Letter To You</em> in four days), but at the time this was pretty much unprecedented.</p>\n<p>With five songs in the can, Bruce had almost half an album if he chose to complete it, but it took another eight years before he&#8217;d get around to it.</p>\n<p>On March 19, 2005, Bruce re-convened the original players from 1997 and added Lisa Lowell and Mark Pender to the mix. This time they recorded\u00a0<em>nine\u00a0</em>songs in a single day, and now he\u00a0definitely\u00a0had enough material for an album. (He&#8217;d still record a few more the following year, however, once he&#8217;d finished touring behind\u00a0<em>Devils &amp; Dust</em>.)</p>\n<p>One of the songs recorded during that second Seeger Session was a rollicking cover of the traditional song, &#8220;Old Dan Tucker,&#8221; first recorded by Harry C. Browne in 1916 (although the song dates back much farther via oral tradition).</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Old Dan Tucker Harry C.

In fact, &#8220;Old Dan Tucker&#8221; is the first song Bruce is known to have rehearsed with the Sessions Band when they started preparing for their tour that March.</p>\n<p>When the Seeger Sessions Tour kicked off at the New Orleans Jazz\u00a0 &amp; Heritage Festival the following month, &#8220;Old Dan Tucker&#8221; was front and center, providing an immediate spotlight for banjoist Greg Liszt.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Old Dan Tucker (Live at the New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival, 2006)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QI5qZylXUEQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>And when Bruce wound the tour down, &#8220;Old Dan Tucker&#8221; was one of the songs captured live at Bruce&#8217;s final Dublin show in November 2006.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen with the Sessions Band - Old Dan Tucker (Live In Dublin)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fO0yV_HcXx4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Curiously, though, while several Seeger Sessions songs have re-appeared in the years since, &#8220;Old Dan Tucker&#8221; isn&#8217;t among them.
