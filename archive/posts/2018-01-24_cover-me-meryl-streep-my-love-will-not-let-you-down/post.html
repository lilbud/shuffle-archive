<p>Bonus <em>Cover Me</em> today, because this is just too unlikely to feature on its own:</p>
<p>From the film <em>Ricki and the Flash</em>, Meryl Streep performs “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/01/24/roll-of-the-dice-my-love-will-not-let-you-down/">My Love Will Not Let You Down</a>,” and commits to it pretty hard. Ironically, that’s Rick Springfield on lead guitar.</p>
<p>Enjoy. It works better in the movie. Really.</p>
