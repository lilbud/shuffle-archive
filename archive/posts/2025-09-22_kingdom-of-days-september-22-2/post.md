**1974:** Bruce and the E Street Band play an outdoor show at Kean College in Union, New Jersey, featuring the first known "A Love So Fine" (a work in progress that doesn't even feature that lyric). Listen below–this also happens to be the earliest known recorded show with Max and Roy.

**1979:** Bruce and the E Street Band play their second of two famous "No Nukes" shows at Madison Square Garden under the aegis of Musicians United for Safe Energy (MUSE). Their performance of "Thunder Road" will become the official video for the song. Tom Petty, Jackson Browne, and Rosemary Butler join Bruce on-stage for the encore, but the show-closing "[Quarter to Three](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/08/21/cover-me-quarter-to-three/)" is marred by an uncharacteristically churlish Bruce embarrassing and removing his soon-to-be ex-girlfriend Lynn Goldsmith for taking photos without his permission. This show is available as part of Bruce's official archive series (get it [here](https://live.brucespringsteen.net/live-music/0,20918/Bruce-Springsteen---The-E-Street-Band-mp3-flac-download-9-21-1979-Madison-Square-Garden-New-York-NY.html)), and selections are available on video in the concert film, *The Legendary 1979 No Nukes Concerts*.

**1985:** A bad weather forecast prompts the postponement of a scheduled show at Denver's Mile High Stadium. The evening ended up with clear skies, however, causing a bit of a backlash among fans and press.

**1989:** Bruce joins Jimmy Cliff on stage at The Stone Pony in Asbury Park, where the two play "[Trapped](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/08/05/roll-of-the-dice-cover-me-trapped/)" in its original arrangement.

**1992:** Bruce and his new touring band perform live for *MTV Unplugged* at Warner Hollywood Studios, but after the opening "[Red Headed Woman](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/09/15/roll-of-the-dice-red-headed-woman/)," the band plugs in and rocks for the rest of the show. MTV rolls with it ("Hey, he's Bruce Springsteen. He can do whatever he wants."), and Bruce will release the show (in heavily edited and reassembled order) on CD and DVD as *In Concert/MTV Plugged*. However, the official releases omit several songs performed that night, including the last "[Book of Dreams](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/06/04/roll-of-the-dice-book-of-dreams/)" for 13 years. See more of the missing performances below. Most of the show is available as streaming video from Bruce's official YouTube account.

This show features the tour premieres of "[The Ties That Bind,](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/03/09/roll-of-the-dice-the-ties-that-bind/)" "[Candy's Room](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/05/02/roll-of-the-dice-candys-room/)," "[Racing in the Street](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/10/03/roll-of-the-dice-racing-in-the-street/)," and a rare "[I'm a Rocker](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/09/18/roll-of-the-dice-im-a-rocker/)."

**2012:** Bruce and the E Street Band wrap up the summer leg of the Wrecking Ball Tour with a third show at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, where Bruce tour premieres "[Cynthia](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/09/06/roll-of-the-dice-cynthia/)," "[In the Midnight Hour](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/12/31/matr-wilson-pickett-and-bruce-springsteen-in-the-midnight-hour/)," "Into the Fire," and "[Meeting Across the River](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/08/04/roll-of-the-dice-meeting-across-the-river/)." The show starts late due to inclement weather, and as a result, the band is still going strong when Bruce's 63rd birthday arrives, and Bruce's family comes on stage to present him with his cake.
