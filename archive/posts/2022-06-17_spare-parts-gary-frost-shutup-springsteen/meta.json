Then I asked myself a question\u2026what does the song mean when the relationship is over?</p>\n<p>&#8220;Most people can relate to having a song that they consider &#8216;our song&#8217;. The song starts playing, you immediately start smiling and thinking of your special someone, maybe you are singing along and it\u2019s such a great feeling. Unfortunately after a breakup the same song still stirs up feelings and not the good kind. That\u2019s how I got the idea for &#8220;Shutup Springsteen.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Gary&#8217;s song may be sad, but it&#8217;s also sly. Listen carefully to catch Bruce&#8217;s song titles (and not just his hits) interwoven throughout. Frost even co-opts the riff from Bruce&#8217;s 1984 pop hit &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/12/25/roll-of-the-dice-dancing-in-the-dark/\">Dancing in the Dark</a>&#8221; and transforms it into the anchor for his new country single.</p>\n<p>I mentioned that Frost and Springsteen are neighbors, but Gary&#8217;s Springsteen connections reach back generations: his grandfather worked at Slattery&#8217;s Gas Station in Freehold next door to Bruce&#8217;s childhood home. &#8220;My grandfather would give Bruce quarters for the cigarette machine, and when he was outside playing his guitar squirt him with a garden hose.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Shutup Springsteen&#8221; is available now on Spotify and YouTube. If you find yourself in New Jersey this summer, catch one of Gary&#8217;s many area appearances.
