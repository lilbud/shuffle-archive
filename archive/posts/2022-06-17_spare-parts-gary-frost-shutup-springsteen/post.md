"Shutup Springsteen" isn't the first song inspired by a certain New Jersey rock star, but it may very well be the cleverest.

Released just a few hours ago by 23-year-old rising country artist (and Bruce's neighbor) Gary Frost, "Shutup Springsteen" isn't the slam you might expect from the title–it's actually a bittersweet song of love and loss, and one obviously written by a fan.

"Springsteen's music has always been a big part of my life," Gary explains. "When I was writing the song I was thinking particularly about his love songs and what special significance they might have to people in relationships. Then I asked myself a question...what does the song mean when the relationship is over?

"Most people can relate to having a song that they consider 'our song'. The song starts playing, you immediately start smiling and thinking of your special someone, maybe you are singing along and it's such a great feeling. Unfortunately after a breakup the same song still stirs up feelings and not the good kind. That's how I got the idea for "Shutup Springsteen."

Gary's song may be sad, but it's also sly. Listen carefully to catch Bruce's song titles (and not just his hits) interwoven throughout. Frost even co-opts the riff from Bruce's 1984 pop hit "[Dancing in the Dark](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/12/25/roll-of-the-dice-dancing-in-the-dark/)" and transforms it into the anchor for his new country single.

I mentioned that Frost and Springsteen are neighbors, but Gary's Springsteen connections reach back generations: his grandfather worked at Slattery's Gas Station in Freehold next door to Bruce's childhood home. "My grandfather would give Bruce quarters for the cigarette machine, and when he was outside playing his guitar squirt him with a garden hose."

"Shutup Springsteen" is available now on Spotify and YouTube. If you find yourself in New Jersey this summer, catch one of Gary's many area appearances. You can find his tour schedule and more music [here](https://www.garyfrostcountry.com/).
