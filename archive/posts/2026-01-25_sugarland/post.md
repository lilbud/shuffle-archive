For decades, “Sugarland” was one of the great for Springsteen collectors. It was the ghost in the machine of the early eighties: a song that existed in the cracks between Bruce’s home-recorded solitude and the stadium-shaking roar of 

*what if’s**Born in the U.S.A.*

When it finally officially surfaced on , it didn’t just fill a gap in the discography; it provided a missing link in Bruce’s cinematic exploration of the American Dream in decay.

It’s a downright shock that it took so long for a studio version of “Sugarland” to see the light of day. Of all the songs on it’s the only one for which Bruce created no less than arrangements–every one of them a winner.

There’s the original rock arrangement recorded on January 18, 1983…

…and the “Cadillac Ranch”-esque arrangement recorded twelve days later…

…which also has a more ornamental, almost Cajun-esque arrangement…

…and of course the officially released version, a starker and darker acoustic arrangement that fans considered definitive long before Bruce confirmed it on .

“Sugarland” also has the distinction of being the only previously-unreleased-in-any-form song to have been performed live in concert–on the Born in the U.S.A. Tour no less! (Twice!)

So why did it languish in the vaults all those decades? That’s high on the list of questions I’ve always wanted to ask its author.

If we infer from chronology, “Sugarland” was born as a rock song–-almost rockabilly, in fact. (Check out those early arrangements above.) And if Bruce’s original music doesn’t exactly match the sentiment of his lyrics, it at least adds a fitting irony.

If most rockabilly is about Saturday night release, the original versions of “Sugarland” are Monday morning hangovers: jittery and anxious, the sound of a man who’s been drinking too much coffee and staring at too many notices.

*past due*

That’s the theme of “Sugarland”: the elusive American Dream racing far ahead of American Reality. In many ways a sister song to “Seeds,” “Sugarland” spotlights the plight of struggling farmers instead of itinerant oil workers. The upshot is the same: the forgotten working man turns increasingly bitter as he contemplates ever more desperate measures.

Springsteen wastes no time establishing the stakes: our hero Tommy is drowning his despair and desperately searching for a way to stay financially afloat. His grain silos are full, but his pockets are empty.

*The rains and the field covered with tar*  
*Can’t get a price to see my way clear*  
*I’m sitting down at the Sugarland bar*  
*You might as well bury my body right here*



*Tractor and combines out in the cold*  
*Shed’s piled high with the wheat we ain’t sold*  
*Silo’s filled with last year’s crop*  
*If something don’t break here we’ll all gonna drop*

And if times weren’t hard enough (the early 1980s ushered in a severe American farming crisis), Tommy has an ever-growing family to support.

*My wife’s got another coming in July*  
*She’s just laying up and all she does is cry, cry, cry*  
*“Tommy, oh, Tommy, I’m so alone,*  
*Tommy, oh, Tommy, oh, won’t you stay home”*



*Pa don’t say nothing except when it rains*  
*He sits by the window listening to the sound of passing trains*  
*Going out at night, carrying an empty load*  
*We got a whole lot of grain and ain’t got nowhere to go*

“Sugarland” isn’t just a song about farming; it’s a song about betrayal. Tommy has done everything right. He’s worked the land, he’s been loyal, and yet he’s watching his world evaporate. His wife is crying in the kitchen, and the silence in the house is becoming louder than the sound of the tractor.

Bruce devotes four of the song’s five verses to exposition, painstakingly establishing high stakes both emotional and financial. Everything leads up to the final verse, which leaves our hero on the verge of drastic (and possibly illegal) action.

*Well if them prices don’t get no higher*  
*I’ll fill this duster with gas and set these fields on fire*  
*Sit up on the ridge where the bluebirds fly*  
*And watch the flames rise up against the Sugarland sky*

Tommy is contemplating agricultural arson. Is it a protest? A scream of helpless ness? Insurance fraud? If the land is worth more to burned than arable, well then…

Well then?

We never find out. “Sugarland” not only doesn’t resolve a story, it doesn’t even one. It’s all exposition. It ends at the point most stories start. But to focus on plot (or lack thereof) is to miss Bruce’s point: when one’s economic circumstances pose an existential threat, one’s integrity is often the first casualty.

*tell*

It’s a theme carried over from explored throughout , and into and beyond.
