title: (Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher
---

I guess everyone has that one song, right?

You know the one I mean: the one that comes on the radio, and you stop in your tracks, turn the volume up, and no matter who else is in the room, you’re dancing and singing full-throatedly.

*way*

Right?

Ahem. Anyway, Jackie Wilson’s “Higher and Higher” has always been that song for me. Seriously, this post is taking me forever to write, because I keep replaying it.

“Higher and Higher” was a huge hit for Wilson, peaking at #6 on the Hot 100 and reaching the top spot on the U.S. R&B chart. It was a hit in the UK, too–charting in the top 20 , once in 1969 and once in 1987–and Rolling Stone considers it one of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. So yeah, it’s pretty great.

*twice*

But that bolt of lightning almost didn’t strike: “Higher and Higher” was first recorded by The Dells, although it wasn’t released until 1968, after Wilson’s version had become a hit. The Dells’ version features different lyrics, a different title, a different tempo and plays more like a late-sixties R&B ballad (which it basically is).

The Dells had already recorded their version when writer Gary Jackson tweaked the original (written by Carl Smith and Raynard Miner) and sold producer Carl Davis on it. Davis had a vision of the song in his head, but Wilson wasn’t delivering on it–he’d heard The Dells’ version and was singing more in that vein. After delivering some coaching to Wilson (and standing ready to record it himself if necessary), Wilson nailed his vocal in one take.

“Higher and Higher” went on to become one of Wilson’s best-known songs, earning a posthumous re-release–and unfortunately, a video–in 1987.

Let’s try to pretend we didn’t see that one–Wilson deserves better.

Anyway, Jackie Wilson was one of the most dynamic performers to grace a stage, with some of the best moves. His knee drops and falsetto flourishes are not unfamiliar to Springsteen fans–it’s clear that Wilson was an influence on Bruce’s stagecraft.

It’s not surprising in the least that “Higher and Higher” turned up in Bruce’s setlists in 1977. It’s only surprising that he seemed to forget about it for more than two decades afterward. Here’s Bruce’s first ever performance of “Higher and Higher,” from the closing stand of his 1977 tour in Boston, complete with the Miami Horns. It’s a joyous rave-up that never loses its power.

Bruce played “Higher and Higher” a couple of times at one-off ’77 shows after the tour ended (along with a ), but after that the song was MIA for more than twenty years.

And then: on October 20, 2009, just as Bruce was about to wrap the main set at the very last show Bruce would ever play at the Philadelphia Spectrum, a brilliant fan (to whom I owe a beer if I ever run into him or her at a show) held up a sign, caught Bruce’s eye, and…

Well you’ll just need to watch. And you really should, because this may be the single most joyous, spontaneous Springsteen moment I’ve ever seen (virtually, alas) at a show. Watch the looks between Bruce and Steve as they get rolling–they know full well what’s about to break loose. And Bruce… let’s just say Jackie Wilson was alive that night.

That was an inspired request, and an inspired performance–and Bruce knew it, because a week later, at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame’s 25th Anniversary Concert, Bruce reprised it with an all-star slate of performers to close out the show. Check it out below–it’s a veritable E Street Family and Friends Reunion.

“Higher and Higher” was a standard encore for the remainder of the Working on a Dream Tour, and it’s popped up a couple of times since, the last time in 2015. But even though Bruce gave it a rest for his last tour, something tells this time he hasn’t forgotten about it. We’ll see it again.
