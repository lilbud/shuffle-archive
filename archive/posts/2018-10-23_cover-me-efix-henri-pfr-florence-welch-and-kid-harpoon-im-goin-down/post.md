And now for something completely different.

I'd heard Florence Welch and Kid Harpoon's acoustic take on "[I'm Goin' Down](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/06/05/roll-of-the-dice-im-goin-down/)" from their BBC 6 appearance years ago, but when I searched youtube for it today, I stumbled across this little gem–a remix of an acoustic cover of a minor 80s pop hit. It's pretty darn good.
