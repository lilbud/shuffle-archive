<p>Okay, I’m about to break my own rules, because technically “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/08/05/roll-of-the-dice-cover-me-trapped/">Trapped</a>” is not a Springsteen original–therefore this is really a Jimmy Cliff cover rather than a Springsteen cover.</p>
<p>But I’m making an exception for two reasons:</p>
<p>First, because these kids are obviously covering Bruce’s concert arrangement; Cliff’s original version sounds nothing like this.</p>
<p>But more importantly: here’s a whole stage full of talented and passionate young musicians rocking out to the music of Bruce Springsteen, and if the pure joy these kids take in Bruce’s inspiration doesn’t warm the heart of any Springsteen fan, I don’t know what will.</p>
<p>So take a few minutes of your quarantine to watch the students of the Cleveland School of Rock perform a terrific cover of “Trapped” in front of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. You’ll be glad you did.</p>
