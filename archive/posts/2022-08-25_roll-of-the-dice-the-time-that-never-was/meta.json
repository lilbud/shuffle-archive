Lyrically, it explores the same themes as &#8220;The River,&#8221; but it&#8217;s paired with a lush, romantic backing track that would be right at home on\u00a0<em>The Promise</em> (or the soundtrack to\u00a0<em>Eddie and the Cruisers</em>, which is what this song constantly evokes for me).</p>\n<p>The narrator of &#8220;The Time That Never Was&#8221; could easily be the same narrator of &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/03/04/roll-of-the-dice-the-river/\">The River,</a>&#8221; in fact. Bruce&#8217;s lyrics take that final, immortal line of &#8220;The River&#8221; (<em>is a dream a lie of it don&#8217;t come true, or is it something worse?</em> ), and he answers it with a narrator who can&#8217;t help but look back on a youthful past that never lived up to its promise, even at the time.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Sometimes I wake up in the morning and it cuts me like a knife</em><br />\n<em>I come face-to-face with my longing for another world, another life</em><br />\n<em>And a time that never was</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>We drove on, fueled not by the future but by a past we could never touch</em><br />\n<em>Forced to run head-on collisions till we vanished in the dust</em><br />\n<em>Of a time that never was</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>So kiss me once more baby, one more kiss baby you must</em><br />\n<em>Don&#8217;t ever let me forget, girl, a time that never was</em><br />\n<em>A time that never was</em></p>\n<p>Bruce&#8217;s lyrics are spare but cutting. It&#8217;s one thing to live in the past, constantly reliving one&#8217;s glory days. It&#8217;s another to reach life&#8217;s late stages and realize those glory days never came at all. Our narrator had a dream and a promise, but they never came true.</p>\n<p>But\u00a0 it&#8217;s the backing track that elevates &#8220;The Time That Never Was&#8221; to true hidden gem status, from Max&#8217;s girl group drum beat to the Four Seasons-esque backing vocals by Stevie, Clarence, Bruce, and Roy, to that gorgeous, swoony Big Man sax solo.</p>\n<p>Not only do we hear the E Street Band at the peak of their power, &#8220;The Time That Never Was&#8221; may be a contender for the finest band arrangement and mix on record. We easily hear each band member&#8217;s contributions, and each gets a chance to shine. Even Garry is unusually prominent in the bass-driven mix, a treat we don&#8217;t often get to experience.</p>\n<p>The 2016 River Tour was a missed opportunity to give &#8220;The Time That Never Was&#8221; the concert debut it deserves. Maybe we&#8217;ll yet see it, but there&#8217;s something perfectly fitting about a song that sounds like classic E Street with a title like &#8220;The Time That Never Was&#8221; remaining forever unplayed.</p>\n<p><strong>The Time That Never Was<br />\nRecorded:</strong> June 27, 1979 &#8211; March 16, 1980<br />\n<strong>Released:\u00a0</strong><em>The River: Outtakes\u00a0</em>(2015)<br />\n<strong>Never performed</strong></p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
