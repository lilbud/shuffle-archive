We should be back in a groove now, though, so let’s start back up with one of my favorite recent Springsteen covers.</p>
<p>Rob Notes is a German singer-songwriter with incredible range, no matter how you measure it: musically (he’s equally at home at the piano or with an electric guitar), vocally (with a range of more than three octaves), and in his choice of material, which includes both original songs and covers of classics from Bette Midler to Bruce Springsteen.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, Rob debuted an album of fresh cover arrangements, called (appropriately) <em>CoverTime</em>. And while I may be biased, I think the standout track is his seventies hard rock version of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/03/01/roll-of-the-dice-spirit-in-the-night/">Spirit in the Night</a>.”</p>

<p>No matter how many times I listen to it (and I’ve listened to it a lot), my mind can’t quite believe this isn’t a vintage 1970s recording, so perfectly does Notes capture the guitar rock sound of the era.</p>
<p>And if the arrangement doesn’t sufficiently wow you, how about the fact this is a solo track? That’s Rob on all instruments and vocals, right down to a killer guitar solo. Even the soundstage is dynamic–this is a track you should listen to with headphones on.</p>
<p>Check out more of Rob’s music <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2aFP-Lt_bUAj0UufO06QnQ">here</a>, and let’s hope he takes another dip into Bruce’s catalog soon.</p>
