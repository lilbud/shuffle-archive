The most underdeveloped of the songs Bruce grappled with during these sessions, &#8220;Stockton Boys&#8221; was discarded somewhere along the way to\u00a0<em>The River\u00a0</em>(although some of its lyrics would show up a few years down the road on\u00a0<em>Born in the U.S.A.).</em></p>\n<p>However, not just one but\u00a0<em>four</em> home-recorded outtakes of a very work-in-progress &#8220;Stockton Boys&#8221; escaped into the wild, and it&#8217;s fascinating not just to hear this unreleased song, but also to listen in on Bruce&#8217;s songwriting process. Let&#8217;s eavesdrop&#8230;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen Stockton Boys #1\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/E66vPl0zvLA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>As I mentioned, the song isn&#8217;t fully developed. A lot of the lyrics are bluffed, but there&#8217;s enough there to figure out what Bruce was aiming for. And those first lines should sound at least a bit familiar&#8211;and the second verse variation even more so:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>They wear it in their eyes, they wear it on their shirts</em><br />\n<em>They come down here looking to get hurt</em></p>\n<p>&#8230;because <a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/01/11/roll-of-the-dice-working-on-the-highway/\">they&#8217;d show up in somewhat altered form</a> a few years later:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Friday night&#8217;s pay night guys fresh out of work</em><br />\n<em>Talking about the weekend scrubbing off the dirt</em><br />\n<em>Some heading home to their families, <strong>some are looking to get hurt</strong></em><br />\n<em>Some going down to Stovell <strong>wearing trouble on their shirts</strong></em></p>\n<p>The chorus is the only part of the song with fully intelligible lyrics, and it&#8217;s here where the song comes into focus:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Oh Stockton boys</em><br />\n<em>Acting tough, making noise</em><br />\n<em>They say they&#8217;re coming down here to collect</em><br />\n<em>The Stockton boys, acting tough making noise</em><br />\n<em>Man they just want to get wrecked</em></p>\n<p>The Stockton boys are hooligans, come to town to cause trouble. It&#8217;s unclear from the fragments we have whether the boys are petty thieves &#8220;coming down here to collect,&#8221; drug addicts &#8220;looking to get wrecked&#8221; or just escaping a life they never planned on but have found themselves saddled with.</p>\n<p>A later take provides more evidence for the last interpretation. In this version, the boys come to town every Friday night (fresh out of work). In fact, that first verse of &#8220;Working on the Highway&#8221; feels very much like it grew out of this particular take of &#8220;Stockton Boys.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen  Stockton Boys #2\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3oP4FUeH1C8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>These boys are looking for release and reprieve. They &#8220;leave their little girls at home&#8221; and &#8220;come looking for a kiss.&#8221;</p>\n<p>(By the way, there is indeed a town of Stockton in the state of New Jersey, but why Bruce would choose it as the setting for this song is a mystery: it&#8217;s a tiny burg, with only a little over 500 residents even today, and it&#8217;s nestled in a beautiful location along the river just north of Lambertville and across from New Hope, PA. Hardly the kind of town that would witness a scene like this one.)</p>\n<p>In a third version, Bruce puts a fine point on the Stockton boys:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen Stockton Boys #3\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6rY67dsXmnU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Oh Stockton Boys, too young to figure it out</em><br />\n<em>Just too dumb to pack it up and get out</em><br />\n<em>Stockton Boys</em><br />\n<em>Get out of Stockton boys</em></p>\n<p>Well, that&#8217;s pretty direct, isn&#8217;t it?</p>\n<p>Finally, a fourth outtake almost feels like a reversion. Bruce dips into his trusty book of stock character names to humanize and garner more sympathy for the song&#8217;s protagonists:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen Stockton Boys #4\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/T4JL2egZvk8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Oh Jenny&#8217;s still got money in her car</em><br />\n<em>And Eddie stills begging fights in Queenstown bars</em><br />\n<em>This life never ends</em><br />\n<em>Will they never learn?</em></p>\n<p>There&#8217;s no evidence to suggest that any version of &#8220;Stockton Boys&#8221; ever made it past the home demo stage. Other than some shared DNA with &#8220;Working on the Highway,&#8221; this one appears to be truly lost in time.</p>\n<p><strong>Stockton Boys</strong><br />\n<strong>Recorded:</strong> January &#8211; February 1980 (home demos only)<br />\n<strong>Never released</strong><br />\n<strong>Never performed live</strong></p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
