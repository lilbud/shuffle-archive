<p>Not only can Italy claim to have the most avid Springsteen fans in the world, they also have some of Bruce’s best cover artists.</p>
<p>Take for example, Mardi Gras. Named as a hat tip to Creedence Clearwater Revival’s final album,  Rome-based Mardi Gras has a long discography of original songs and great covers dating back to their acoustic days in 2006.</p>
<p>Their version of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/01/05/roll-of-the-dice-land-of-hope-and-dreams/">Land of Hope and Dreams</a>” hails from their <em>Among the Streams</em> album, released in 2011. (You can also find it on the Italian Springsteen tribute album, <em>For You 2</em>.) It’s every bit as uplifting, hopeful and joyful as Bruce’s original.</p>

<p>Mardi Gras is still going strong almost a decade later. Last year, they released a cover of Willie Nile’s “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/05/16/meeting-across-the-river-bruce-springsteen-and-willie-nile-one-guitar/">One Guitar</a>” to support the Light of Day Foundation.</p>
