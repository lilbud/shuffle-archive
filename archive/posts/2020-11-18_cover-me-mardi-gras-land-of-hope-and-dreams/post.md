Not only can Italy claim to have the most avid Springsteen fans in the world, they also have some of Bruce's best cover artists.

Take for example, Mardi Gras. Named as a hat tip to Creedence Clearwater Revival's final album, Rome-based Mardi Gras has a long discography of original songs and great covers dating back to their acoustic days in 2006.

Their version of "[Land of Hope and Dreams](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/01/05/roll-of-the-dice-land-of-hope-and-dreams/)" hails from their *Among the Streams* album, released in 2011. (You can also find it on the Italian Springsteen tribute album, *For You 2*.) It's every bit as uplifting, hopeful and joyful as Bruce's original.

Mardi Gras is still going strong almost a decade later. Last year, they released a cover of Willie Nile's "[One Guitar](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/05/16/meeting-across-the-river-bruce-springsteen-and-willie-nile-one-guitar/)" to support the Light of Day Foundation.

And just weeks ago, the band released their latest single, "[You Do Something to Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLxHosDO_xN4L9P66R7U9KlovilbUSIN_X&v=ITi6aZp0su8&feature=emb_logo)."
