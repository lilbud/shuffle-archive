<p>In the right arrangement and in another time, Sting’s 1996 song about a young man who accidentally kills a man while practicing with his brother’s rifle would have been right at home on Bruce Springsteen’s <em>Nebraska</em> album.</p>

<p>So when Bruce agreed to perform at a benefit concert and Sting tribute in 2011, “I Hung My Head” was a natural choice for Bruce to cover. But the arrangement Bruce chose was neither Nebraska acoustic or compound-time original.</p>
<p>Instead, Bruce worked up a rocking arrangement (complete with a couple of blistering guitar solos) that brought the house down.</p>

<p>Bruce turned in a fantastic performance that night, too great for it to remain a one-off.</p>
<p>Three years later, when Sting was one of the Kennedy Center honorees, Bruce repaid his friend’s favor (Sting had saluted Bruce with <a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/10/26/cover-me-sting-the-rising/">his cover of “The Rising”</a> just two years earlier) with a reprise of his 2011 performance.</p>

<p>And if Bruce’s second performance doesn’t quite measure up to his original one, the choir that joins him for the final chorus at least makes for a powerful ending.</p>
<p>“I Hung My Head” is one of Bruce’s finer modern-day covers, one that deserves an outing more often.</p>
