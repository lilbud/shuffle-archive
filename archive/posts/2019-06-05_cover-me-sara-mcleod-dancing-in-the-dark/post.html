<p>Wow, do I love this version of <a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/12/25/roll-of-the-dice-dancing-in-the-dark/">Bruce’s greatest hit</a>.</p>
<p>It’s both different and great–and arguably an even better arrangement than Bruce’s original track.</p>
<p>The video’s fantastic, too: appropriately, it features Sara home alone, trying to start a fire without a spark. She eventually hits the streets, but the only connection she find is to the rhythmic, pounding drums and a backing track that sounds like it would have been right at home in an eighties dance club.</p>

<p>Sara never gained much attention in the U.S., so if you want to track down the original recording, look for her 2010 Australian album release, <em>Madness.</em></p>
<p>Bonus: there are a few live performance clips floating around, but this 2010 rehearsal footage with her band is even edgier than her album track.</p>
