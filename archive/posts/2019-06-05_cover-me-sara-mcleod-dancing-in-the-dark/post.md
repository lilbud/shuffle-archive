Wow, do I love this version of [Bruce’s greatest hit](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/12/25/roll-of-the-dice-dancing-in-the-dark/).

It’s both different and great–and arguably an even better arrangement than Bruce’s original track.

The video’s fantastic, too: appropriately, it features Sara home alone, trying to start a fire without a spark. She eventually hits the streets, but the only connection she find is to the rhythmic, pounding drums and a backing track that sounds like it would have been right at home in an eighties dance club.

Sara never gained much attention in the U.S., so if you want to track down the original recording, look for her 2010 Australian album release, *Madness.*

Bonus: there are a few live performance clips floating around, but this 2010 rehearsal footage with her band is even edgier than her album track.
