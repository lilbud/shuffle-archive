<p>Oh, how I love this song.</p>
<p>I’m a sucker for Bruce Springsteen Band material in general, but “I Remember” stops me in my tracks every single time.</p>
<p>Although I’m not even sure if we can fairly call it a song. It may be more accurate to call it an improv piece: a loose framework for Bruce to testify, plead, and soul shout his way through. For anyone paying attention in 1972, “I Remember” telegraphed the commanding presence with which he would someday hold entire stadiums in thrall.</p>
<p>But this was pre-E Street 1972, in a little club called The Back Door in Richmond, where the Bruce Springsteen Band held down a month-long residency.</p>
<p>There are few surviving documents from these shows, but we know that Bruce performed “I Remember” at least twice (and once prior in a late 1971 appearance at the Student Prince in Asbury Park).</p>
<p>The clip below is from February 1972, the best of the three surviving, circulating recordings. It’s clear throughout that the band –Vini Lopez, David Sancious, Garry Tallent, and Steven Van Zandt–are vamping too, laying down a mellow, tender, restrained two-chord groove for Bruce to lose himself in <em>for fifteen minutes. </em>Only occasionally does the band swell in power and volume to give Bruce a cresting wave to surf–which he does with rueful vocals that ooze heartache and regret far beyond what one would expect from a 22-year-old singer-songwriter.</p>

<p>Each recorded performance of “I Remember” is unique–Bruce clearly intended it as such–but the storyline is always the same: Boy had girl; boy lost girl; boy misses girl; boy finds girl; boy begs girl; girl rebuffs boy; girl shrugs and takes boy back.</p>
<p>It’s almost pointless to try to document the lyrics, because they were different every time. The lyrics aren’t the point, anyway–it’s the delivery that matters. This is a young Bruce Springsteen already in top preachifying, testifying form. Don’t even bother reading the lyrics until after you’ve had the impact of listening to his performance above with fresh ears first. Already did? Okay, fine:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>I remember the first time I saw you</em><br/>
<em>Because I thought to myself</em><br/>
<em>I said that woman sure looks good</em><br/>
<em>And I went home and I prayed to the Lord each night</em><br/>
<em>I said oh Jesus, I told him I had to have you</em><br/>
<em>Because I thought that you would love me</em><br/>
<em>Like I would want my baby to</em><br/>
<em>Yes and I remember the first time I loved you, sure felt true</em><br/>
<em>And  I remember, yes I do…</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>And I remember the first time I touched you</em><br/>
<em>Because the stars fell from the sky</em><br/>
<em>And they glowed down on the earth like a giant firefly</em><br/>
<em>Yeah that’s when I knew, that’s when I knew it had to be you</em><br/>
<em>That’s when I knew, That’s when I knew</em><br/>
<em>There was just no other, that I needed you for my lover</em><br/>
<em>That’s when I knew, oh that’s when I knew</em><br/>
<em>Because I remember</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Yes, I love you</em><br/>
<em>Yes, I love you</em><br/>
<em>Yes, I do</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>I remember the first time that you left me</em><br/>
<em>Because I thought that you were fooling when you said you was gonna go</em><br/>
<em>Just like you fooled me, you fooled me so many times before</em><br/>
<em>Cause you know we got along alright for a few years</em><br/>
<em>But then just things started happening and it wasn’t the same no more</em><br/>
<em>No it just wasn’t the same no more</em><br/>
<em>And you’d gone off so many times before</em><br/>
<em>But you always came back</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>And I remember when you went out and you slammed the door once</em><br/>
<em>Yes I remember that was the first time</em><br/>
<em>You went out and you slammed the door</em><br/>
<em>And I thought you were fooling, yeah, I thought you were fooling</em><br/>
<em>And you went out and slammed the door a second time</em><br/>
<em>But you came back, oh you came back yes you did</em><br/>
<em>And you went out and I heard that door slam three times</em><br/>
<em>But you came back to me</em><br/>
<em>And I remember the fourth time you went out, and this time it hurt</em><br/>
<em>But you came back</em><br/>
<em>But it was the fifth time that you went out, the door went</em><br/>
<em>And you didn’t come back…</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>And the days went by, and the months went by</em><br/>
<em>And I just stayed up in my room</em><br/>
<em>I just hung out in my room, playing the records and my radio</em><br/>
<em>Just watching tv all the time by myself</em><br/>
<em>And then it was a year gone by and I saw you</em><br/>
<em>Walking downtown, I saw you walking down the street</em><br/>
<em>Oh you looked so good you were boppin’ down the street</em><br/>
<em>She had her hair all done up, and she had that little dog</em><br/>
<em>She had that dog on that leash, and her friends were telling her</em><br/>
<em>You got that boy on a leash, you got that boy on a leash</em><br/>
<em>She had that little dog that she always had, walking down the street</em><br/>
<em>She was boppin down the street to the beat of the band</em><br/>
<em>And her friends say you got that boy on a leash, you got that boy on a leash<br/>
</em><br/>
<em>And I said “hi baby how ya doing”, and she said “Oh I been fine”</em><br/>
<em>And I said “yeah you look good, what’s been happening”</em><br/>
<em>She said “oh not too much, I just been going to work, I got a little job</em><br/>
<em>And I got a good man and he says he loves me”</em><br/>
<em>And then I said “baby, oh baby sweet baby, won’t you come back to me?”</em><br/>
<em>And she said “no I just can’t make it”</em><br/>
<em>I said “darling won’t you come back to me I’ve been missing you”</em><br/>
<em>And she said “no I just can’t take it”</em><br/>
<em>I said “darling won’t you come back to me because I need you”</em><br/>
<em>And she said “no honey I just can’t stand it again”</em><br/>
<em>I said “but darling I want you”</em><br/>
<em>She said “no Bill I just can’t make it”</em><br/>
<em>I said “well honey I need you”</em><br/>
<em>And she said “no, I just can’t make it”</em><br/>
<em>I said “but darling I want you I feel so bad”</em><br/>
<em>She said “no, I just can’t make it”</em><br/>
<em>I said “Darling I love you, and you said it would be alright, you said it was going to be alright”</em><br/>
<em>“Oh darling I love you won’t you come on home”</em><br/>
<em>She said “I’m coming home”</em><br/>
<em>She’s coming home, she’s coming home</em><br/>
<em>She’s coming home, she’s coming home, baby’s coming home</em><br/>
<em>Baby’s coming home</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>And I remember the first time I loved you</em><br/>
<em>It was so damn true</em><br/>
<em>Oh I remember your lovin’</em><br/>
<em>Yes I do</em><br/>
<em>Yes I really do girl</em><br/>
<em>Because the way you love me sometimes is just so frightening</em><br/>
<em>Can’t you see we go together, mama, just like thunder and just like lightning</em></p>
<p>For an example of just how much of an improv piece “I Remember” was, compare it to this (unfortunately) incomplete recording from just three months earlier. The structure and story are clearly the same, but by the time we reach the 4:30 mark, Bruce is in completely different but just as impassioned lyrical territory.</p>

<p>No studio recording of “I Remember” is known to exist, and if there are other live performances they do not circulate widely. But these fifty-year-old live recordings give us an early glimpse into the show-stopping power Bruce Springsteen would soon bring to bigger and bigger stages.</p>
