It may be more accurate to call it an improv piece: a loose framework for Bruce to testify, plead, and soul shout his way through. For anyone paying attention in 1972, &#8220;I Remember&#8221; telegraphed the commanding presence with which he would someday hold entire stadiums in thrall.</p>\n<p>But this was pre-E Street 1972, in a little club called The Back Door in Richmond, where the Bruce Springsteen Band held down a month-long residency.</p>\n<p>There are few surviving documents from these shows, but we know that Bruce performed &#8220;I Remember&#8221; at least twice (and once prior in a late 1971 appearance at the Student Prince in Asbury Park).</p>\n<p>The clip below is from February 1972, the best of the three surviving, circulating recordings. It&#8217;s clear throughout that the band &#8211;Vini Lopez, David Sancious, Garry Tallent, and Steven Van Zandt&#8211;are vamping too, laying down a mellow, tender, restrained two-chord groove for Bruce to lose himself in <em>for fifteen minutes. </em>Only occasionally does the band swell in power and volume to give Bruce a cresting wave to surf&#8211;which he does with rueful vocals that ooze heartache and regret far beyond what one would expect from a 22-year-old singer-songwriter.</p>\n<div id=\"v-urNxW8lJ-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='568' src='https://videopress.com/embed/urNxW8lJ?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>Each recorded performance of &#8220;I Remember&#8221; is unique&#8211;Bruce clearly intended it as such&#8211;but the storyline is always the same: Boy had girl; boy lost girl; boy misses girl; boy finds girl; boy begs girl; girl rebuffs boy; girl shrugs and takes boy back.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s almost pointless to try to document the lyrics, because they were different every time. The lyrics aren&#8217;t the point, anyway&#8211;it&#8217;s the delivery that matters. This is a young Bruce Springsteen already in top preachifying, testifying form. Don&#8217;t even bother reading the lyrics until after you&#8217;ve had the impact of listening to his performance above with fresh ears first. Already did? Okay, fine:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I remember the first time I saw you</em><br />\n<em>Because I thought to myself</em><br />\n<em>I said that woman sure looks good</em><br />\n<em>And I went home and I prayed to the Lord each night</em><br />\n<em>I said oh Jesus, I told him I had to have you</em><br />\n<em>Because I thought that you would love me</em><br />\n<em>Like I would want my baby to</em><br />\n<em>Yes and I remember the first time I loved you, sure felt true</em><br />\n<em>And\u00a0 I remember, yes I do&#8230;</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>And I remember the first time I touched you</em><br />\n<em>Because the stars fell from the sky</em><br />\n<em>And they glowed down on the earth like a giant firefly</em><br />\n<em>Yeah that&#8217;s when I knew, that&#8217;s when I knew it had to be you</em><br />\n<em>That&#8217;s when I knew, That&#8217;s when I knew</em><br />\n<em>There was just no other, that I needed you for my lover</em><br />\n<em>That&#8217;s when I knew, oh that&#8217;s when I knew</em><br />\n<em>Because I remember</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Yes, I love you</em><br />\n<em>Yes, I love you</em><br />\n<em>Yes, I do</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I remember the first time that you left me</em><br />\n<em>Because I thought that you were fooling when you said you was gonna go</em><br />\n<em>Just like you fooled me, you fooled me so many times before</em><br />\n<em>Cause you know we got along alright for a few years</em><br />\n<em>But then just things started happening and it wasn&#8217;t the same no more</em><br />\n<em>No it just wasn&#8217;t the same no more</em><br />\n<em>And you&#8217;d gone off so many times before</em><br />\n<em>But you always came back</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>And I remember when you went out and you slammed the door once</em><br />\n<em>Yes I remember that was the first time</em><br />\n<em>You went out and you slammed the door</em><br />\n<em>And I thought you were fooling, yeah, I thought you were fooling</em><br />\n<em>And you went out and slammed the door a second time</em><br />\n<em>But you came back, oh you came back yes you did</em><br />\n<em>And you went out and I heard that door slam three times</em><br />\n<em>But you came back to me</em><br />\n<em>And I remember the fourth time you went out, and this time it hurt</em><br />\n<em>But you came back</em><br />\n<em>But it was the fifth time that you went out, the door went</em><br />\n<em>And you didn&#8217;t come back&#8230;</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>And the days went by, and the months went by</em><br />\n<em>And I just stayed up in my room</em><br />\n<em>I just hung out in my room, playing the records and my radio</em><br />\n<em>Just watching tv all the time by myself</em><br />\n<em>And then it was a year gone by and I saw you</em><br />\n<em>Walking downtown, I saw you walking down the street</em><br />\n<em>Oh you looked so good you were boppin&#8217;
