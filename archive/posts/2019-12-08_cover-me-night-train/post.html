<p>What prompted the impromptu, accelerated “Night Train” performance?</p>
<p>When Bruce and the band started their second set that night with “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/12/24/cover-me-santa-claus-is-comin-to-town/">Santa Claus Is Comin’ to Town</a>,” the fake snowfall went a bit overboard, and a clean-up crew had to come out to mop up the stage.</p>
<p>To kill time while the crew did their work, Bruce led the band through “Night Train” in a one-time-only performance.</p>
<p>It’s never been heard from since.</p>
