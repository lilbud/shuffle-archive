But for me, it was always too slow, and I just wanted to do it mid-tempo, because it’s such a moving song. I felt that song, for me, should be faster. Bruce always did it so slow, and it was very effective in one way, but I just felt it would be nice if it moved along a bit.” — <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Roger Taylor, <em>Goldmine</em>, February 2015</span></span></p></blockquote>
<p>I’m sure we’ve all thought that “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/10/03/roll-of-the-dice-racing-in-the-street/">Racing in the Street</a>” would be more moving if it, well, moved more.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>No?</p>
<p>Well, Roger Taylor did at least, and that’s what led him to record a cover of one of Bruce’s most achingly and beautifully poignant songs on his 1984 solo album, <em>Strange Frontier–</em>with a harder, faster spin on it.</p>
<p>Does it work? You decide.</p>
