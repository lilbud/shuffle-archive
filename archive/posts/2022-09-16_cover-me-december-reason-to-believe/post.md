This is the second appearance on the Shuffle for Glasgow-based indie-rock band December.

[Their cover of "No Surrender"](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/03/05/cover-me-december-no-surrender/) was deservedly a reader favorite earlier this year, and now they're back with an upbeat cover of "[Reason to Believe](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/02/27/roll-of-the-dice-reason-to-believe/)."

December's version of "Reason to Believe" hews closer to the original than their "No Surrender" cover, but they manage to imbue it with a brighter, more hopeful sound than the *Nebraska* original.

"We wanted to pay tribute to the original without copying it," lead guitarist Scott Pattison told me, "and to try to include some of the atmospheric tones we like from our Celtic influences. I guess we've ended up somewhere in the middle of the two live versions Springsteen does with a bit of U2 influenced guitar thrown in! Maybe not too bad a place to be."

Why another Bruce cover so soon after the first?

"Each year we offer our followers a chance to sponsor a song," explained Pattison. "Johan, one of our followers from Denmark, asked us to consider this song and we were delighted to as it is one of our favourite songs. It speaks to hope in the struggle. Everyone can relate to it."

Scott also hinted that we should keep an eye out for at least one more Springsteen cover in the near future, so we may not have seen the last of them here on the blog. Until then, enjoy their latest track and head over to [their site](https://www.decemberband.com/) to check out more of their original music and covers.
