I suppose that&#8217;s the theme of this update: getting back to normal.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s start with my report/review from this past Saturday night&#8217;s reopening of Springsteen on Broadway. While certainly anything\u00a0<em>but</em> a normal event (even without the big protest out front), it marked the beginning of a new beginning, and I was thrilled and honored to be a part of it.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Anti-vax protesters march outside &#039;Springsteen on Broadway&#039; debut\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_QcgmwnzDJM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Backstreets was kind enough to publish my full review yesterday&#8211;if you haven&#8217;t read it and you&#8217;re so inclined, you can read it <a href=\"https://backstreets.com/news.html#July26\">here</a>, but beware: spoilers abound!</p>\n<p>You can also see brief clips from the show below.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"The BOSS Is Back! Watch Clips from Springsteen On Broadway\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/W7Zh9FCAerE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Next, the news I&#8217;ve been dreading but knew I&#8217;d someday have to face:</p>\n<p>On July 1, after 1,273 consecutive days of twice-daily publishing, I&#8217;m taking a vacation. And not just a little vacation, mind you, but a month-long break so I can recharge my batteries for the next part of this ride.</p>\n<p>Of course for me, &#8220;vacation&#8221; means that during the month of July, I&#8217;ll only be posting one article each day instead of two.</p>\n<p><em>Kingdom of Days</em> will continue without interruption, as those posts are largely pre-written and are just lightly refreshed each year. (I&#8217;ve been sneaking in some treats lately, though, with my favorite one coming tomorrow.) All of July&#8217;s posts are already in the can.</p>\n<p><i>Roll of the Dice</i>, however, will go on hiatus after this Wednesday&#8217;s post; <em>Cover Me</em> goes on break after tomorrow; and <em>Meeting Across the River</em> is already on pause after yesterday&#8217;s entry. All three series will resume in August.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, I&#8217;ll be taking an honest-to-goodness tropical vacation for the first part of July, with very spotty (at best) wi-fi. So my apologies in advance to those of you who rely on my social media posts for these daily updates, as I may be Facebook- and Twitter-challenged for a bit. (This might be a good time to subscribe to the\u00a0 blog for auto-updates via e-mail.)</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll actually be blogging like a fiend for the second half of July, so I can build up a solid month&#8217;s queue of content before resuming publishing in August. (Once upon a time, I wrote on a one-month lead, and blogging life was stress-free. Over the past year, though, my buffer has slowly whittled down to nothing, and I&#8217;ve been flying by the seat of my pants for weeks now.)</p>\n<p>So I&#8217;m confident I&#8217;ll be back right on schedule on August 1st, and publishing twice-daily again from that point forward.</p>\n<p>I hope you&#8217;ll still be here when I get back. We&#8217;re getting close to the end of our spelunking expedition through Bruce&#8217;s catalog&#8211;maybe another year or so left&#8211;but there are some very deep caves still ahead of us that I can&#8217;t wait to shine a light into.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, thanks for reading and joining me this far, and I hope you have the opportunity to rest and recharge this summer, too.</p>\n<p>Have a great July, and I&#8217;ll see you in August!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>My first-hand report from Re-opening Night of Springsteen on Broadway, and my
