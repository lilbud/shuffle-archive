<p>Apparently it has, and boy has a lot happened since then.</p>
<p>I hope things are gradually getting back to normal for you and yours, as they are for me and mine. I suppose that’s the theme of this update: getting back to normal.</p>
<p>Let’s start with my report/review from this past Saturday night’s reopening of Springsteen on Broadway. While certainly anything <em>but</em> a normal event (even without the big protest out front), it marked the beginning of a new beginning, and I was thrilled and honored to be a part of it.</p>

<p>Backstreets was kind enough to publish my full review yesterday–if you haven’t read it and you’re so inclined, you can read it <a href="https://backstreets.com/news.html#July26">here</a>, but beware: spoilers abound!</p>
<p>You can also see brief clips from the show below.</p>

<p>Next, the news I’ve been dreading but knew I’d someday have to face:</p>
<p>On July 1, after 1,273 consecutive days of twice-daily publishing, I’m taking a vacation. And not just a little vacation, mind you, but a month-long break so I can recharge my batteries for the next part of this ride.</p>
<p>Of course for me, “vacation” means that during the month of July, I’ll only be posting one article each day instead of two.</p>
<p><em>Kingdom of Days</em> will continue without interruption, as those posts are largely pre-written and are just lightly refreshed each year. (I’ve been sneaking in some treats lately, though, with my favorite one coming tomorrow.) All of July’s posts are already in the can.</p>
<p><i>Roll of the Dice</i>, however, will go on hiatus after this Wednesday’s post; <em>Cover Me</em> goes on break after tomorrow; and <em>Meeting Across the River</em> is already on pause after yesterday’s entry. All three series will resume in August.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I’ll be taking an honest-to-goodness tropical vacation for the first part of July, with very spotty (at best) wi-fi. So my apologies in advance to those of you who rely on my social media posts for these daily updates, as I may be Facebook- and Twitter-challenged for a bit. (This might be a good time to subscribe to the  blog for auto-updates via e-mail.)</p>
<p>I’ll actually be blogging like a fiend for the second half of July, so I can build up a solid month’s queue of content before resuming publishing in August. (Once upon a time, I wrote on a one-month lead, and blogging life was stress-free. Over the past year, though, my buffer has slowly whittled down to nothing, and I’ve been flying by the seat of my pants for weeks now.)</p>
<p>So I’m confident I’ll be back right on schedule on August 1st, and publishing twice-daily again from that point forward.</p>
<p>I hope you’ll still be here when I get back. We’re getting close to the end of our spelunking expedition through Bruce’s catalog–maybe another year or so left–but there are some very deep caves still ahead of us that I can’t wait to shine a light into.</p>
<p>In the meantime, thanks for reading and joining me this far, and I hope you have the opportunity to rest and recharge this summer, too.</p>
<p>Have a great July, and I’ll see you in August!</p>
