And if it&#8217;s still summer, it&#8217;s a good day for The Bruce Springsteen Band.</p>\n<p>Even though this recording is from a February 1972 gig, something about the Bruce Springsteen Band sound has always screamed <em>summer</em> to me, and this little gem is a great example.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Make Up Your Mind&#8221; is an end-of-summer breakup song with a twist. Bruce&#8217;s narrator is the older, worldly suitor; the offscreen love interest is the younger-than-she-looks but older-than-her-years schoolgirl who calls the shots in their zero-sum relationship until she tires of him and moves on.</p>\n<div id=\"v-nSmO6L6G-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='568' src='https://videopress.com/embed/nSmO6L6G?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>In the first verse, our narrator appears to hold the upper hand: he wants the girl, he gets the girl, and when the girl falls for him (or so he thinks) and demands a commitment, we feel his lone wolf spirit start to slip away.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Hey now baby, when I walk with you</em><br />\n<em>Aw you make me feel just fine</em><br />\n<em>Yeah and Darlin&#8217; when I talk to you</em><br />\n<em>Oh Child, I could not read between your lines</em><br />\n<em>Oh how was I to know you were just a lonely teenager</em><br />\n<em>It didn&#8217;t show, nah, it didn&#8217;t show</em><br />\n<em>And like a man on the hunt</em><br />\n<em>I was trying to cage her</em><br />\n<em>But she wouldn&#8217;t go, she couldn&#8217;t go</em><br />\n<em>And after she told me how she loved me so</em><br />\n<em>Said you&#8217;d better make up your mind, babe</em><br />\n<em>You&#8217;d better do it in time, babe</em><br />\n<em>It&#8217;s me or you, you got to choose</em><br />\n<em>Somebody&#8217;s got to lose</em></p>\n<p>That last line raises a flag: she seems less interested in monogamy than in victory. Sure enough, once she has her man captive, she loses interest. Her professions of love were only a tactic in a game, and our narrator realizes that at about the same time he realizes he&#8217;s head over heels for her.</p>\n<p>Bruce flips the chorus, and when it&#8217;s delivered by the narrator it lands as a desperate plea rather than an ultimatum.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Baby when you smile at me</em><br />\n<em>Well, it make me feel so good inside</em><br />\n<em>When you walk and you talk and you while away your time with me</em><br />\n<em>Ah you know that&#8217;s what I like</em><br />\n<em>Well you look so soft but you talk so loud</em><br />\n<em>Oh you were a young girl, just out of school</em><br />\n<em>And when you walked away, you walked so proud</em><br />\n<em>I had to guess that was your ruling</em><br />\n<em>Well how was I to know that all the time I loved ya</em><br />\n<em>You were only fooling</em><br />\n<em>Well you gotta make up your mind, girl</em><br />\n<em>You&#8217;d better do it in time, babe</em><br />\n<em>It&#8217;s me or you, you got to choose</em><br />\n<em>Somebody&#8217;s got to lose</em></p>\n<p>We take an instrumental break here, because this is The Bruce Springsteen Band, and every BSB song must have a Sancious keyboard solo and a Springsteen guitar solo&#8211;a good thing in almost any situation, but it works especially well here as a way to hold the listener&#8217;s suspense before Bruce finally reveals the fate of our lovers.</p>\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t end well, of course.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Hey baby when I walk with you</em><br />\n<em>Ah you make me feel just fine</em><br />\n<em>But when I talk to you</em><br />\n<em>I can&#8217;t read between your lines</em><br />\n<em>Well how was I to know you were just a lonely teenager</em><br />\n<em>You were a young girl just out of school</em><br />\n<em>And I was like a man on the hunt</em><br />\n<em>Yes I tried to cage her</em><br />\n<em>But you said no, I guess I wasn&#8217;t worth it</em><br />\n<em>And when you walked away</em><br />\n<em>I knew you weren&#8217;t fooling then babe</em><br />\n<em>Ah you gotta make up your mind</em><br />\n<em>You gotta do it in time</em><br />\n<em>It&#8217;s me or you, make up your mind, babe</em><br />\n<em>Do it for me in time</em><br />\n<em>You got to choose</em><br />\n<em>Somebody&#8217;s got to lose</em></p>\n<p>Bruce reminds us of the age difference and power imbalance before giving his narrator his just desserts as the girl accepts his ultimatum, makes up her mind, and walks away.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Make Up Your Mind&#8221; appeared only briefly in Bruce&#8217;s sets. As far as we know the band played it only during their month-long residency in Richmond in February 1972.</p>\n<p>Both musically and lyrically, it stands alone (except for that &#8220;talk so loud/walked so proud&#8221; couplet, which would make its way onto Bruce&#8217;s second album the following year), a brief dalliance that was nice while it lasted&#8211;just like those summer romances.</p>\n<p><strong>Make Up Your Mind<br />\nNever recorded</strong><br />\n<strong>Never released</strong><br />\n<strong>First performed:</strong> February 4, 1972 (Richmond, VA)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> February 25, 1972 (Richmond, VA)</p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
