<p>Even though this recording is from a February 1972 gig, something about the Bruce Springsteen Band sound has always screamed <em>summer</em> to me, and this little gem is a great example.</p>
<p>“Make Up Your Mind” is an end-of-summer breakup song with a twist. Bruce’s narrator is the older, worldly suitor; the offscreen love interest is the younger-than-she-looks but older-than-her-years schoolgirl who calls the shots in their zero-sum relationship until she tires of him and moves on.</p>

<p>In the first verse, our narrator appears to hold the upper hand: he wants the girl, he gets the girl, and when the girl falls for him (or so he thinks) and demands a commitment, we feel his lone wolf spirit start to slip away.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Hey now baby, when I walk with you</em><br/>
<em>Aw you make me feel just fine</em><br/>
<em>Yeah and Darlin’ when I talk to you</em><br/>
<em>Oh Child, I could not read between your lines</em><br/>
<em>Oh how was I to know you were just a lonely teenager</em><br/>
<em>It didn’t show, nah, it didn’t show</em><br/>
<em>And like a man on the hunt</em><br/>
<em>I was trying to cage her</em><br/>
<em>But she wouldn’t go, she couldn’t go</em><br/>
<em>And after she told me how she loved me so</em><br/>
<em>Said you’d better make up your mind, babe</em><br/>
<em>You’d better do it in time, babe</em><br/>
<em>It’s me or you, you got to choose</em><br/>
<em>Somebody’s got to lose</em></p>
<p>That last line raises a flag: she seems less interested in monogamy than in victory. Sure enough, once she has her man captive, she loses interest. Her professions of love were only a tactic in a game, and our narrator realizes that at about the same time he realizes he’s head over heels for her.</p>
<p>Bruce flips the chorus, and when it’s delivered by the narrator it lands as a desperate plea rather than an ultimatum.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Baby when you smile at me</em><br/>
<em>Well, it make me feel so good inside</em><br/>
<em>When you walk and you talk and you while away your time with me</em><br/>
<em>Ah you know that’s what I like</em><br/>
<em>Well you look so soft but you talk so loud</em><br/>
<em>Oh you were a young girl, just out of school</em><br/>
<em>And when you walked away, you walked so proud</em><br/>
<em>I had to guess that was your ruling</em><br/>
<em>Well how was I to know that all the time I loved ya</em><br/>
<em>You were only fooling</em><br/>
<em>Well you gotta make up your mind, girl</em><br/>
<em>You’d better do it in time, babe</em><br/>
<em>It’s me or you, you got to choose</em><br/>
<em>Somebody’s got to lose</em></p>
<p>We take an instrumental break here, because this is The Bruce Springsteen Band, and every BSB song must have a Sancious keyboard solo and a Springsteen guitar solo–a good thing in almost any situation, but it works especially well here as a way to hold the listener’s suspense before Bruce finally reveals the fate of our lovers.</p>
<p>It doesn’t end well, of course.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Hey baby when I walk with you</em><br/>
<em>Ah you make me feel just fine</em><br/>
<em>But when I talk to you</em><br/>
<em>I can’t read between your lines</em><br/>
<em>Well how was I to know you were just a lonely teenager</em><br/>
<em>You were a young girl just out of school</em><br/>
<em>And I was like a man on the hunt</em><br/>
<em>Yes I tried to cage her</em><br/>
<em>But you said no, I guess I wasn’t worth it</em><br/>
<em>And when you walked away</em><br/>
<em>I knew you weren’t fooling then babe</em><br/>
<em>Ah you gotta make up your mind</em><br/>
<em>You gotta do it in time</em><br/>
<em>It’s me or you, make up your mind, babe</em><br/>
<em>Do it for me in time</em><br/>
<em>You got to choose</em><br/>
<em>Somebody’s got to lose</em></p>
<p>Bruce reminds us of the age difference and power imbalance before giving his narrator his just desserts as the girl accepts his ultimatum, makes up her mind, and walks away.</p>
<p>“Make Up Your Mind” appeared only briefly in Bruce’s sets. As far as we know the band played it only during their month-long residency in Richmond in February 1972.</p>
<p>Both musically and lyrically, it stands alone (except for that “talk so loud/walked so proud” couplet, which would make its way onto Bruce’s second album the following year), a brief dalliance that was nice while it lasted–just like those summer romances.</p>
