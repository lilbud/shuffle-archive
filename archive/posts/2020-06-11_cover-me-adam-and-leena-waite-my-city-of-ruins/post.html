<p>Adam Waite is the Minister of Music at Montview Boulevard Presbyterian Church in Denver.</p>
<p>He’s got roots in New Jersey too, though, and he does them proud with his cover of “My City of Ruins” with his wife Leena on violin and backing vocals.</p>
<p>For anyone wondering right now how we begin again: We start by rising up.</p>
