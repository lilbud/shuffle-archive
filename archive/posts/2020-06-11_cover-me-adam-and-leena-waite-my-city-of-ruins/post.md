Adam Waite is the Minister of Music at Montview Boulevard Presbyterian Church in Denver.

He's got roots in New Jersey too, though, and he does them proud with his cover of "My City of Ruins" with his wife Leena on violin and backing vocals.

For anyone wondering right now how we begin again: We start by rising up.

Thank you, Adam and Leena. I needed that.
