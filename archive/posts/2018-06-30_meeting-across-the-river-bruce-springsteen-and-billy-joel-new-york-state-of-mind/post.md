One of my all-time favorite meetings, from the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame 25th Anniversary concert on October 29, 2009: Bruce and Billy Joel team up (along with Mark Rivera and the E Street Band) on Billy’s “New York State of Mind.”

Bruce’s vocals soar, Billy’s piano glides, and both of them have a ball. I break out in a big smile every time I watch it.

Amazingly, Billy never released “New York State of Mind” as a single, but the 1976 *Turnstiles* deep cut became a pop standard nonetheless, covered by countless artists.
