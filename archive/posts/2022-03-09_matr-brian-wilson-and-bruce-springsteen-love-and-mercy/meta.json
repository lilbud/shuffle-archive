I sit on the side of the stage sometimes myself during sound check, so I was paying special attention to the guy. I couldn&#8217;t tell who he was at first. I couldn&#8217;t see very well from the stage. But he definitely was someone&#8211;everyone who walked past him shook his hand.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It turns out it was Bruce Springsteen. He was so quiet there on the side of the stage. It was almost like he was taking notes. At the end of the show, he came onstage and sat in with us; he played guitar on &#8216;Barbara Ann&#8217; and sang harmonies on &#8216;Love and Mercy.'&#8221;</p>\n<p>We can only imagine what must have been running through Bruce&#8217;s mind that night. &#8220;There\u2019s no greater world created in rock and roll than the Beach Boys, the level of musicianship,&#8221; Bruce opined in last year&#8217;s documentary film, <em>Brian Wilson: Long Promised Road</em>. &#8220;I don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s touched it yet.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Barbara Ann&#8221; was the more famous of the two songs Bruce played with Brian that night, but &#8220;Love and Mercy&#8221; was far more personal.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Brian Wilson - Love And Mercy (Official Music Video)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2y3J46DhoL0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Wilson wrote it for his 1988 debut solo album as a personal expression of his hopes and wishes for the world, and it&#8217;s widely considered to rank among his best work. &#8220;The beauty of [Wilson&#8217;s music] carries with it a sense of joyfulness even in the pain of living,&#8221; Bruce said in the film, and that description certainly applies to &#8220;Love and Mercy.&#8221;</p>\n<p>When he returned to the stage that night for that final &#8220;Love and Mercy&#8221; encore, Bruce stayed in the background during Brian&#8217;s moving final number. Wilson recalls the moment:</p>\n<p>&#8220;I remember turning and seeing him standing next to Taylor Mills, our pretty blond backup singer, and thinking that all singers have moments when they are just guys (or girls) standing at microphones. It doesn&#8217;t matter how famous they are. They still have to go to the microphone and sing.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Fortunately that moment was captured on video&#8211;not all of it, unfortunately, but enough of it.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Brian Wilson &amp; Band w/ B Springsteen/D Diken Red Bank NJ\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/u8W2hsInu2o?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Wilson remembers talking with Bruce after they left the stage that night:</p>\n<p>&#8220;Bruce came by afterward and hung out for a little while. He had really nice things to say about the band and how perfectly it fit the music. He said that the songs were American masterworks. It was nice of him to say.
