Until it was released in the autumn of 1974 on *1969: The Velvet Underground Live* (recorded live at The Matrix in San Francisco just a few weeks before Bruce made his first appearance there), the only way you'd be familiar with "We're Gonna Have a Real Good Time Together" is if you'd heard Lou Reed's rave-up at one of the band's early concerts.

Patti Smith had heard it, though. She ran with Reed and considered him a major influence, and by 1976 she'd incorporated the song into her set lists.

On the night after Thanksgiving, Patti played a gig at The Bottom Line in New York City, and Bruce not only made an appearance, he joined Patti on stage for most of the show.

Among the highlights that evening: Patti's version of "We're Gonna Have a Real Good Time Together" with her full band, plus Bruce doing his best Professor impression on the piano.

To this day, that holiday evening remains the only time Bruce has ever played this Underground classic.
