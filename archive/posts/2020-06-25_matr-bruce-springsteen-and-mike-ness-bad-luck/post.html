<p>If you were with me about six months ago, you may remember our spotlight on Bruce’s studio guest appearance with Mike Ness on “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/01/22/matr-mike-ness-and-bruce-springsteen-misery-loves-company/">Misery Loves Company</a>.”</p>
<p>I led that article stating that Bruce had been a fan of Social Distortion (Ness’ band) since the early nineties. It’s a pretty safe bet that one of the songs that originally grabbed his attention was “Bad Luck.”</p>

<p>“Bad Luck” was the lead single for <em>Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell</em>, Social Distortion’s fourth studio album in 1992. It quickly became–and remains–the band’s biggest hit, peaking at #2 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks (now known as Alternative Airplay) chart.</p>
<p>Years later, Ness made two appearances with Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band, once on the Working on a Dream Tour and again on the Wrecking Ball Tour. On both occasions, the song they played together was Social Distortion’s biggest hit.</p>

<p>Six years after Ness’ last E Street stage appearance, Bruce returned the favor when Social Distortion played Asbury Park’s Sea.Hear.Now. Festival in the autumn of 2018. Bruce took a rare rocking break from his Broadway schedule to join the band for three songs that night: the aforementioned “Misery Loves Company,” a terrific cover of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/07/19/cover-me-ring-of-fire/">Ring of Fire</a>,” and (of course) “Bad Luck.”</p>
