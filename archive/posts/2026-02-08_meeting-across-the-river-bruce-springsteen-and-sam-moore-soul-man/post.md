“Soul Man” made it all the way to Number One when it was first recorded and released in 1967 on the Stax label by Sam Moore and Dave Prater. It actually peaked at #2, but Sam & Dave won the Grammy Award for Best R&B Group Performance and has become one of the all-time classic rock’n’soul hits.

Bruce has often cited Sam Moore as a major influence, and it’s easy to see why. Check out this contemporaneous concert clip and watch Sam’s commanding performance. No surprise that Bruce would seek out Sam’s shows whenever he came through town.

Bruce and Sam finally got a chance to perform live together on the Reunion Tour and at Bruce’s holiday benefit shows in 2003 (Sam had already appeared on the album), but it was their performance at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame’s 25th Anniversary Concert, backed by the E Street Band, that got wide notice, and for good reason. Enjoy Sam Moore working his magic with Bruce, more than 40 years after the amazing performance above.
