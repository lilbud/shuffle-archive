Robbins personally asked Bruce to write a song for the film. Bruce watched the film and then delivered a quiet, introspective reflection from the point of view of the murderer. It plays over the film&#8217;s end credits.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Dead Man Walkin&#039;\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/O5RnDJ1pyCM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>The melody is low, slow, and dark; the lyrics are terse and sparse. The metaphors hit with added weight, in stark contrast to the prisoner&#8217;s bare surroundings.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>There&#8217;s a pale horse comin&#8217;</em><br />\n<em>And I&#8217;m gonna ride it</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;ll rise in the morning</em><br />\n<em>My fate decided</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;m a dead man walkin&#8217;</em></p>\n<p>The pale horse, of course, is a biblical reference to death, and the prisoner&#8217;s declaration to ride it is his acceptance of his decided fate&#8211;his acknowledgement that he is addressing is in his last hours. As the Death Row saying goes, he is a dead man walking,</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>In Saint James Parish</em><br />\n<em>I was born and christened</em><br />\n<em>Now I&#8217;ve got my story</em><br />\n<em>Mister, ain&#8217;t no need for you to listen</em><br />\n<em>It&#8217;s just a dead man talkin&#8217;</em></p>\n<p>The prisoner starts to tell his story, and then abandons it. There&#8217;s no point: he&#8217;s soon to be a dead man, and his story (he believes) doesn&#8217;t matter any more.</p>\n<p>Like many of Bruce&#8217;s great songs, the bridges in &#8220;Dead Man Walkin&#8221; are home to the song&#8217;s most memorable lines:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Once I had a job, I had a girl&#8230;</em><br />\n<em>Between our dreams and actions lies this world</em></p>\n<p>The job/girl line is a callback to the loser in &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/01/22/roll-of-the-dice-downbound-train/\">Downbound Train</a>,&#8221; and the dream/actions line is an absolutely brilliant reduction of pretty much that entire song from\u00a0<em>Born in the U.S.A.&#8211;</em>so much so that one can&#8217;t help but wonder if we&#8217;re listening to the same character, further down a very dark and lonely road.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>In the deep forest</em><br />\n<em>Their blood and tears rushed over me</em><br />\n<em>All I could feel was the drugs and the shotgun</em><br />\n<em>And my fear up inside of me</em><br />\n<em>Like a dead man talkin&#8217;</em></p>\n<p>In this verse, the prisoner relives his crime, and we&#8217;re left to wonder if he truly meant to kill his victims, or whether he reacted in the moment out of fear and desperation. Either way, it doesn&#8217;t matter. As the narrator says:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>&#8216;Neath the summer sky my eyes went black</em><br />\n<em>Sister, I won&#8217;t ask for forgiveness&#8211;my sins are all I have</em></p>\n<p>Another great line: when all is taken away from you, when your hours are numbered in single digits, all you have to take with you is your impact on the world around you&#8211;even if that impact was a dark one. He owns his sins, because they are the only things he can cling to.</p>\n<p>Time passes now, and the onset of dawn represents an ending rather than a beginning. In the last hours of his life, our narrator dreams deeply, escaping his circumstances briefly and fleetingly for the final time.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Now the clouds above my prison</em><br />\n<em>They move slowly across the sky</em><br />\n<em>There&#8217;s a new day dawning</em><br />\n<em>My dreams are full tonight</em></p>\n<p>&#8220;Dead Man Walkin&#8221; was nominated for the Best Song Academy Award for 1995, and he performed the song at the award ceremonies.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Dead Man Walking\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TxF8mlR2fmk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Although it lost to &#8220;Colors of the Wind&#8221; from\u00a0<em>Pocahontas</em> (don&#8217;t get me started), &#8220;Dead Man Walkin'&#8221; garnered critical acclaim and airplay when it was released on the film&#8217;s soundtrack in 1996. (In 2003, Bruce would release it as a bonus track on\u00a0<em>The Essential Bruce Springsteen</em>.)</p>\n<p>The film debuted in December 1995, and Bruce was already in the middle of his solo acoustic tour supporting\u00a0<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2023/06/03/album-companion-the-ghost-of-tom-joad/\"><em>The Ghost of Tom Joad</em></a>. Bruce played &#8220;Dead Man Walkin&#8221; sporadically throughout the first six months of the tour, resurrecting it late in the Reunion Tour for a handful of performances.
