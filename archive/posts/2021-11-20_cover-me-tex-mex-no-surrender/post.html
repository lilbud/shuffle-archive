<p>I don’t know why so many of my favorite Springsteen covers originate in Italy, but they do.</p>
<p>Like this one, for instance.</p>
<p>Guitarist, bassist and lead singer Frank Get is a familiar face to Light of Day attendees–he’s played the annual benefit on a few occasions, including this past year’s virtual event.</p>
<p>In 2009, Get founded a blues combo called Tex Mex, and in 2013, the band released an album of original songs called <em>The Best Has Yet to Come. </em>Tucked away at the end of the disc was a single cover song–a gorgeous and tender arrangement of Bruce Springsteen’s “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/11/18/roll-of-the-dice-no-surrender/">No Surrender.</a>” It’s a song that’s been on my mind a lot this week, and Get’s version dials up the nostalgia and the sentiment without losing its fierce resolve.</p>

<p>Tex Mex isn’t around anymore, but Frank certainly is. With any luck, we’ll see him at Light of Day again soon.</p>
