<p>It was only their second show since Danny’s funeral, and the set list was still emotional, opening with a rare “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/12/06/roll-of-the-dice-blood-brothers/">Blood Brothers</a>,” and featuring a dedicated-to-Danny “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/03/01/roll-of-the-dice-spirit-in-the-night/">Spirit in the Night</a>.” For the encore, though, Bruce wanted something uplifting, so he turned to one of his influences, Florida resident Roger McGuinn of The Byrds.</p>
<p>After a heartfelt introduction (it was that kind of night), Bruce and Roger played a consoling “Turn! Turn! Turn!” that would eventually be officially released on the <em>Magic Tour Highlights</em> EP. But that wasn’t the only number the two men played that night–they followed “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/06/09/matr-bruce-springsteen-and-roger-mcguinn-turn-turn-turn/">Turn! Turn! Turn!</a>” with The Byrds’ other number one hit, “Mr. Tambourine Man.”</p>

<p>Although this was the first time Bruce and Roger performed the song together in public, they’d actually performed it once before, almost two decades earlier in a most private setting: at Tom Petty’s birthday party in 1990.</p>
<p>Astute listeners probably realize that the version Bruce and Roger played in Tampa was considerably longer than The Byrds’ 1965 version, and it had more verses.</p>

<p>That’s because the “Mr. Tambourine Man” was more than twice as long when Bob Dylan first wrote, recorded, and released it just a few weeks before The Byrds’ version.</p>

<p>It was the abridged Byrds’ version that became a smash hit, though. In a way, Bruce was covering both Dylan and The Byrds that night, using Dylan’s original lyrics and The Byrds’ arrangement for a one-time-only special performance.</p>
