<p>Forgive me if I can’t pin down the original recording of today’s cover tune, but <em>you</em> try figuring out the earliest recording of the most-published Christmas hymn in North America.</p>
<p>“Joy to the World” happens to be celebrating its tricentennial this year–it was written by Isaac Watts exactly 300 years ago in 1719. Here’s the oldest recording I could find, from 1926.</p>

<p>Bruce covered it once and only once–at Sting and Trudie Styler’s Rainforest Fund holiday concert in December 2016.</p>
<p>And he wasn’t alone: Bruce was joined by the assembled array of artists–including Sting, Lisa Fischer, Darlene Love, Ronnie Spector, James Taylor, Idina Menzel, Jennifer Nettles, and Vittorio Grigolo–for an all-star Christmas Carol encore.</p>

<p>This is the first time Bruce was known to have <em>officially</em> performed this perennial seasonal classic… but I suspect that he unofficially covered it long, long before he ever picked up a guitar.</p>
<p>Happy Holidays, however you celebrate them, and may the holiday season bring you peace and joy.</p>
