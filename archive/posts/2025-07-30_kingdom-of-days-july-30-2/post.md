***New for 2025:** No updates*

**1974:** Bruce and the E Street Band co-headline with Roger McGuinn at The Troubadour in West Hollywood, a surprise gig that only became public three days prior. (Bruce doesn’t actually take the stage until almost 2am, however, so this technically qualifies as an entry for July 31.)

**1975:** Bruce wraps up a three-night stand at the Carter Barron Amphitheater in Washington DC’s Rock Creek Park, where he debuts his cover of The Drifters’ “[Up on the Roof](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/12/15/cover-me-up-on-the-roof/).”

**2002:** Finally! After 18 years, Bruce releases a new E Street Band album. *The Rising* is an instant success, the darling of music reviewers and critics, and the catalyst for a new era that lasts to this day, cementing the return of the E Street Band. To celebrate the occasion, Bruce and the band get up early to appear on NBC’s *Today Show* for a mini-concert. Katie Couric interviews virtually the entire band (poor Garry!) before the show. Watch that fun interview below, followed by the songs performed that morning.

That night, Bruce and the band play a public warm-up show, where “[Paradise](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/01/07/roll-of-the-dice-paradise/)” debuts and “[Cover Me](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/01/13/roll-of-the-dice-cover-me/)” returns after a decade of absence. “Into the Fire” features a stunning introduction that features Clarence on bagpipes, but it will be gone when the tour begins in proper.
