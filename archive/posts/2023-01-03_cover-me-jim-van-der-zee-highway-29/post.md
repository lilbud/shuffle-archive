Jim van der Zee is just a few days shy of his 26th birthday, but his career is off to a great start.

In 2018, the Dutch singer-songwriter was the winning contestant on , and with the record deal he won from that competition, he released his debut album, 

*The Voice of Holland**Where I Come From.*

Not only are van der Zee’s vocals terrific (we’d expect as much given his performance on ), but the arrangement is superb as well. “Highway 29” is a quiet, contemplative song; van der Zee preserves its spirit while adorning it with restrained orchestration that never overpowers the lyrics.
