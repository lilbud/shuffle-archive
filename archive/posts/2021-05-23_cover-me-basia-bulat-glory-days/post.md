In September 2013, *The Independent* named Toronto-based Basia Bulat's "Tall Tall Shadow" their song of the week... along with Bruce Springsteen's "Stolen Car."

"I could do a lot worse!" she told an interviewer.

I suspect Basia was pleased by the comparison, because she'd covered one of Bruce's songs just a few months before.

In an acoustic performance for The AV Club, Basia performed "Glory Days" on her trademark autoharp and somehow imbued Bruce's song with even more nostalgia than it already had.

Basia's latest album *Are You in Love* released last year in the early days of the pandemic. Check it out (along with more great music) [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nn2DBJaaepU).
