<p>In September 2013, <em>The Independent</em> named Toronto-based Basia Bulat’s “Tall Tall Shadow” their song of the week… along with Bruce Springsteen’s “Stolen Car.”</p>
<p>“I could do a lot worse!” she told an interviewer.</p>
<p>I suspect Basia was pleased by the comparison, because she’d covered one of Bruce’s songs just a few months before.</p>
<p>In an acoustic performance for The AV Club, Basia performed “Glory Days” on her trademark autoharp and somehow imbued Bruce’s song with even more nostalgia than it already had.</p>
