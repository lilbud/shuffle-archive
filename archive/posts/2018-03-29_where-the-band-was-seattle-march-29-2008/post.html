<p>The train almost wrecked before it left the station.</p>
<p>Bruce chose to open the show with “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/08/05/roll-of-the-dice-cover-me-trapped/">Trapped</a>” for the first (and I believe only) time ever, probably as a sly wink to the show’s venue (KeyArena). The song was immediately recognizable from the opening bars, but Charlie’s organ–the key instrument–couldn’t be heard in the mix.</p>
<p>After an extended intro and some fumbling, the band pulled it out, only for Nils to miss the opening of the “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/11/18/roll-of-the-dice-no-surrender/">No Surrender</a>” audible that shortly followed. Three songs in and two almost-catastrophes, Bruce seemed determined to prove the band’s resilience–so we were off to the races with a wild card-filled show.</p>
<p>The highlight for me: the double-shot of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/05/31/roll-of-the-dice-your-own-worst-enemy/">Your Own Worst Enemy</a>” (only performed nine times to this day) and “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/12/19/roll-of-the-dice-point-blank/">Point Blank</a>.” Given where America sat politically at the time (and sadly, today), “Your Own Worst Enemy” couldn’t have resonated any stronger.</p>

<p>The encores on this leg of the Magic Tour had become pretty set in stone by this point, but Bruce delivered a jolt of energy right at the top of the encore with sign requests for “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/11/19/roll-of-the-dice-tenth-avenue-freeze-out/">Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out</a>” (which had been MIA for a few months) and “Rosalita (Come Out Tonight),” finishing strong and setting the stage for the closing night of the PacNW swing in Vancouver.</p>
