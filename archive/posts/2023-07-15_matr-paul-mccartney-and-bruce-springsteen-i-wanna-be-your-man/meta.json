(I was wrong.) And among all of Paul&#8217;s songs I could have guessed, I doubt I&#8217;d have landed on the one they surprised us with.</p>\n<p>The Beatles thought so little of &#8220;I Wanna Be Your Man&#8221; that they gave it away to some friends. McCartney did most of the heavy lifting, but John Lennon helped him polish it in the corner of a room while said friends&#8211;Mick and Keith&#8211;chatted.</p>\n<p>Grateful for the gift, Mick Jagger and Keith Richards recorded &#8220;I Wanna Be Your Man&#8221; with their up-and-coming band. The resulting single became the first Top Twenty hit for The Rolling Stones, peaking at #12 in the U.K.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Rolling Stones - I Wanna Be Your Man HQ\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NbTtP6j-oyg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Although The Beatles recorded a version of their own, they only released it as an album track, three weeks after the Stones&#8217; single. Technically, that meant The Beatles version was a cover.</p>\n<p>Credit each band for arranging the song in their own style, though: The Stones&#8217; version is gritty and dirty compared to the poppier Beatles track&#8211;exactly what we&#8217;d expect to hear from each band.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"I Wanna Be Your Man (Remastered 2009)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mnct7Qf3SUQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>So when speculating which song Paul and Bruce might perform from McCartney&#8217;s vast catalog, I didn&#8217;t expect a rarely performed (setlists.com ranks it the 109th most frequently performed song in McCartney&#8217;s sets) album track The Beatles never got around to releasing as a single.</p>\n<p>Of course, it was perfect. Following an even more surprising &#8220;Glory Days,&#8221; Sir Paul and The Boss traded vocals on &#8220;I Wanna Be Your Man,&#8221; with Bruce providing a tasty mid-song guitar solo.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Paul McCartney &amp; Bruce Springsteen - Glory Days, I Wanna Be Your Man, The End - MetLife Stadium (4K)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5aYHDniCm4M?start=310&#038;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>The crowd ate it up, so much so that McCartney invited Bruce to join him again only nine days later&#8211;this time across the Atlantic at McCartney&#8217;s headline set at Glastonbury.\u00a0 It was another crowd-pleasing performance, captured professionally by the BBC.</p>\n<div id=\"v-XPKAKtFD-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='408' src='https://videopress.com/embed/XPKAKtFD?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> Although they&#8217;d played the same songs together just nine days earlier, the two rock legends took some time to rehearse with McCartney&#8217;s band before they took the stage in Glastonbury.
