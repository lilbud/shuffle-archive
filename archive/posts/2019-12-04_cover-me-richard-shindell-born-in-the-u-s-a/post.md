meta-description: Richard Shindell’s arrangement of “Born in the U.S.A.” highlights the anger and loss in the lyrics without sacrificing the melody. It’s a brilliant cover–take a listen inside.

Folk singer-songwriter Richard Shindell shares at least two talents with Bruce Springsteen: they’re both fantastic songwriters, and they both have an amazing ability to breathe new life into songs written by other artists.

Shindell, like Bruce, draws from a deep trove of inspiration when he chooses a song to re-interpret; both his studio recordings and stage performances are well worth seeking out.

It was probably inevitable that these two great songwriters would intersect, and although it’s not the first or best time (seek out Shindell’s cover of ““–it’s so gorgeous that it brings a tear to my eye), it’s certainly the most daring.

Shindell truly understands and appreciates “.” His arrangement features the pump organ (which Bruce used throughout his 2005 solo acoustic tour), brilliantly adding a dirge-like element without slowing down the song.

Is it as powerful as the blues arrangement that Bruce featured in his acoustic shows? No, but it’s pretty close, and it’s a much more melodic rendition.
