I told him these were the worst two songs I ever heard, utterly devoid of any pop potential&#8230; He said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll write some more songs and come back.&#8221;&#8211;<em>Mike Appel to Marc Eliot, Down Thunder Road</em></span></p></blockquote>\n<p>Bruce played &#8220;Baby Doll&#8221; for future manager Mike Appel at their very first meeting in 1971. Appel was so unimpressed that Bruce almost didn&#8217;t get a second chance.</p>\n<p>There was something about it, though. Appel was struck by the intensity and sincerity of Bruce&#8217;s performance, and by the creativity if not the polish of Bruce&#8217;s lyrics.</p>\n<p>If you listen to &#8220;Baby Doll&#8221; today, though, it holds up pretty well (except for the definitely un-PC &#8220;deaf and dumb&#8221; descriptor). One can easily imagine the song translating well to the studio and stage with a more orchestral arrangement, and there&#8217;s an innocent, romantic charm to Bruce&#8217;s early lyrics.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s take a listen:</p>\n<div id=\"v-HYkpjTeZ-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='426' src='https://videopress.com/embed/HYkpjTeZ?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>Critics often dismiss &#8220;Baby Doll&#8221; as a\u00a0<em>Tommy\u00a0</em>rip-off, and they have a point.</p>\n<p>The Who&#8217;s concept album had been out for about two years by the time Bruce first performed &#8220;Baby Doll&#8221; for Appel, and both featured a central character devoid of their senses. Bruce also hints that his baby doll, like Tommy, may not be truly physiologically disabled&#8211;her loss of sight, speech, and hearing may symbolize a retreat from a world that only causes her pain.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Whoa, baby doll</em><br />\n<em>They tried to tell me you were deaf and dumb</em><br />\n<em>But I knew they were wrong</em><br />\n<em>You were just a silent one</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Oh, baby doll</em><br />\n<em>They tried to tell me you could not feel</em><br />\n<em>But I found out they tried to conceal</em><br />\n<em>From you that you were warm</em></p>\n<p>Bruce, of course, plays the young hero, as any 22-year-old would-be rock star would. He sees past her disabilities (or defenses), and desperately tries to restore her sense of self-worth.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well, they brought you into their laboratory</em><br />\n<em>And tried to get you to show and tell</em><br />\n<em>They wanted to hear you say that you were sorry</em><br />\n<em>And then they told you that you were conceived in hell</em><br />\n<em>But baby doll, you knew&#8230; you knew that wasn&#8217;t true</em><br />\n<em>You knew that it was them, it wasn&#8217;t you</em></p>\n<p>If Appel had cut Bruce off by this point, I&#8217;d have understood. Even at the time, these were far from Bruce&#8217;s best lyrics. But thankfully, Appel let him continue, because what comes next truly does hint at Bruce&#8217;s talent.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Oh, baby doll</em><br />\n<em>It was so hard to know you</em><br />\n<em>I could not tell, I couldn&#8217;t show you</em><br />\n<em>But I didn&#8217;t have to &#8217;cause you already knew</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Oh, baby doll</em><br />\n<em>We had to see by touching hands</em><br />\n<em>We had to dance to a silent band</em><br />\n<em>And you surprised me being so graceful</em></p>\n<p>Those two lines&#8211;&#8220;We had to see by touching hands/we had to dance to a silent band&#8221;&#8211;are lovely, gentle and spare. Recall that Bruce was very much a fan of his rhyming dictionary in the early 1970s, and you&#8217;ll appreciate his restraint here even more.</p>\n<p>The next verse is even better. Given the central conceit of the song, Bruce&#8217;s tender age, and the pre-politically correct culture he came up in, &#8220;Baby Doll&#8221; had every opportunity to venture into territory that would induce cringes today. But Bruce writes from a place of tender respect for his heroine and a remarkable sense of vulnerable self-awareness:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I know you can&#8217;t hear these songs I sing</em><br />\n<em>But then they&#8217;re more for me than they are for you</em><br />\n<em>Because you don&#8217;t need these songs</em><br />\n<em>Babe, well I got news</em><br />\n<em>Yeah, you knew the first time that I held you, babe</em><br />\n<em>You didn&#8217;t have to hear an &#8220;I love you&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>Bruce finishes the song the way he begins it, reinforcing the notion that Baby Doll might not be truly disabled, but rather simply unseen and unheard.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Oh, baby doll</em><br />\n<em>They tried to tell me you were deaf and dumb</em><br />\n<em>But I knew that they were wrong</em><br />\n<em>And you were just the lonely one</em></p>\n<p>&#8220;Baby Doll&#8221; had promise&#8211;enough promise that Bruce eventually recorded it as a demo at engineer Jim Cretecos&#8217; apartment shortly after signing with Appel in early 1972.\u00a0 (It&#8217;s this version that we listened to above; Bruce&#8217;s original &#8220;Baby Doll&#8221; performance for Appel was on the piano rather than guitar.)</p>\n<p>But just like &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/01/09/roll-of-the-dice-hollywood-kids/\">Hollywood Kids</a>,&#8221; &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/08/31/roll-of-the-dice-jesse/\">Jesse</a>,&#8221; and the other songs Bruce recorded during those original April 1972 demo sessions, &#8220;Baby Doll&#8221; was never released in any form.</p>\n<p><strong>Baby Doll<br />\nRecorded:</strong> April 1972<br />\n<strong>Never released</strong><br />\n<strong>First performed:</strong> November 4, 1971 (New York City, NY)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> November 4, 1971 (New York City, NY)</p>\n<p>\u00a9 October 13 2019 by Ken Rosen</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>&#8220;Baby Doll&#8221; was one of the first songs Bruce played for Mike Appel at their very first meeting, and it almost kept him from getting a second chance.
