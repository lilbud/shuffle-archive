Bruce and the E Street Band rehearse for the upcoming Darkness Tour at the Paramount Theater in Asbury Park. Among the songs they rehearse but never play publicly: “Spanish Eyes,” “The Brokenhearted,” and “The Way.” Listen to them all below, especially “The Brokenhearted,” on which you can hear the original coda (Bruce obviously and jarringly recorded a new one for the version that’s on ) and “The Way,” which to this day has never had a proper performance. The recording quality isn’t the best, but the performance is stunning.

**1978:** *The Promise*
