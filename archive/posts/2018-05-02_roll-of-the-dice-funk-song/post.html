<p>An original Springsteen composition from 1971 that survived into the E Street Band Era?</p>
<p>Yup. (Sort of.)</p>
<p>With lead vocals by Garry and Clarence?</p>
<p>Yup. (Sort of.)</p>
<p>Bruce wrote “Funk Song” in 1971. The earliest known recording of it is from a 1972 band rehearsal. It’s essentially an instrumental jam with a few “Right on!” contributions from Garry (plus some banter that’s fun to listen to):</p>

<p>Other than that rehearsal take, there’s no record of Bruce and the band actually performing the song.  But then it suddenly showed up as a mid-set showpiece for three shows in the summer of 1975, this time with Clarence on “vocals.”</p>
<p>So why the “sort of” qualification? Because even though the 1972 and 1975 versions share the same title, the same instrumental-ness, and the same “right on!” vocals, they are clearly different songs. But since they both share the attributes above, and since they are both essential historical curiosities at this point, I present them here together. Enjoy the 1975 E Street Band version (which IMHO is the superior version) of “Funk Song.”</p>
