One of my favorite things about writing this blog is coming across new Springsteen covers on an almost daily basis.

And while it’s the well-known ones by big-name artists that drive the most traffic and conversation, I often find myself taken by obscure ones by artists I’ve never heard before.

Case in point: this lovely acoustic version of “” by Finnish duo The Lovematches.

[Hungry Heart](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/12/21/roll-of-the-dice-hungry-heart/)

Filmed in a beautiful location to frame their gorgeous harmonies, guitar, and accordion, this is a wonderful track for a quiet weekend morning.
