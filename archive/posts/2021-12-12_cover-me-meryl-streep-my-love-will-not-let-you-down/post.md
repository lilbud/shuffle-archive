Bonus today, because this is just too unlikely to feature on its own:

*Cover Me*

From the film , Meryl Streep performs “,” and commits to it pretty hard. Ironically, that’s Rick Springfield on lead guitar.

*Ricki and the Flash*[My Love Will Not Let You Down](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/01/24/roll-of-the-dice-my-love-will-not-let-you-down/)

Enjoy. It works better in the movie. Really.
