It was a complete audible&#8211;Max Weinberg recalled that the band had never even rehearsed it.</p>\n<div id=\"v-ifW9xsdw-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='568' src='https://videopress.com/embed/ifW9xsdw?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>I&#8217;m not entirely certain how much I trust Max&#8217;s recollection, though. Listening to the muddy recording of that debut performance, while we can certainly hear the band&#8217;s tentativeness and it was clearly an audible, it&#8217;s hard for me to imagine that the arrangement itself was spontaneous.</p>\n<audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-29805-2\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1975-12-12-108-Its-My-Life.mp3?_=2\" /><a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1975-12-12-108-Its-My-Life.mp3\">https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1975-12-12-108-Its-My-Life.mp3</a></audio>\n<p>Because the arrangement they &#8220;fell into&#8221; that night bears scant resemblance to the original song.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s My Life&#8221; had been a hit for The Animals a decade earlier, peaking at #23 on the Billboard Hot 100 (and #7 in the U.K.) in 1965. A dark, ominous-sounding, bass-driven, class-conscious piece of rebellion, &#8220;It&#8217;s My Life&#8221; resonated with both rock artists and fans alike who had found themselves feeling increasingly apart from mainstream society.</p>\n<p>The Animals debuted their new single on the television show\u00a0<em>Hullaballoo\u00a0</em>on October 11, 1965, eleven days before the release of the record. Check out that debut performance below.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"The Animals - It&#039;s My Life (Live, 1965) UPGRADE \u266b\u2665\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BxJxcvS8gck?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>If the original version was dark and ominous, though, Bruce&#8217;s version is a full-on thunderstorm of pent-up rage.</p>\n<p>Within just a couple of weeks, the band had honed and refined their performance, and Bruce dialed up the drama, prefacing the performance with a moody, noir-ish introductory story that for the first time invited his fans into his family dysfunction.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - It&#039;s My Life Live 1975\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wHv_msPx6Po?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Even now, decades later, knowing exactly what&#8217;s coming, I&#8217;m on edge as that first verse builds towards the song&#8217;s first explosive climax.</p>\n<p>The brilliance in Bruce&#8217;s arrangement lies not just in that eruption but in the dormancy that immediately follows. It&#8217;s unnerving, and I imagine the unsettledness we feel is a lot like what Bruce felt as he tried to navigate around his father&#8217;s alcohol-fueled anger episodes.</p>\n<p>It was a far cry from &#8220;Pretty Flamingo.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Bruce continued to perform &#8220;It&#8217;s My Life&#8221; over the three years that followed&#8211;years that perhaps not coincidentally aligned with the lawsuit that kept Bruce from entering the recording studio while he fought for control over his own music.</p>\n<p>By the time Bruce embarked on the Darkness Tour in mid-1978, he&#8217;d shed much of his romantic material (until the encores, at least), constructing a set of original songs in which &#8220;It&#8217;s My Life&#8221; seemed of a piece. Perhaps that&#8217;s why he dropped it by the autumn: the song had lost some of its power surrounded by similarly dark material.</p>\n<p>After a final outing on October 1, 1978 that capped 88 performances of the song, Bruce retired &#8220;It&#8217;s My Life&#8221; for good (to date, at least). That means there isn&#8217;t much video footage of him performing it, especially in its earliest outings. But we do have one tantalizing minute of a 1976 vintage performance that gives us a better sense of the full power of Bruce&#8217;s performance, and I&#8217;ll leave you with that. It&#8217;s well worth watching.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"It&#039;s My Life - Bruce Springsteen circa 1975\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uU99NVwlKRo?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><strong>It&#8217;s My Life<br />\nFirst performed:</strong> December 12, 1975 (Greenvale, NY)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> October 1, 1978 (Atlanta, GA)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>Years before Darkness on the Edge of Town, Bruce gave his fans a glimpse at his dark side with his stunning cover of The Animals&#8217; &#8220;It&#8217;s My Life.&#8221;</p>\n", "protected": false}, "author": 1, "featured_media": 31063, "comment_status": "open", "ping_status": "open", "sticky": false, "template": "", "format": "standard", "meta": {"_monsterinsights_skip_tracking": false, "_monsterinsights_sitenote_active": false, "_monsterinsights_sitenote_note": "", "_monsterinsights_sitenote_category": 0, "jetpack_post_was_ever_published": false, "_jetpack_newsletter_access": "", "_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs": false, "_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id": 0, "_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content": false, "_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content": false, "footnotes": "", "jetpack_publicize_message": "", "jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled": true, "jetpack_social_post_already_shared": true, "jetpack_social_options": {"image_generator_settings": {"template": "highway", "default_image_id": 0, "font": "", "enabled": false}, "version": 2}}, "categories": [4], "tags": [1180, 3078], "class_list": ["post-29805", "post", "type-post", "status-publish", "format-standard", "has-post-thumbnail", "hentry", "category-cover-me", "tag-its-my-life", "tag-the-animals"], "aioseo_notices": [], "jetpack_publicize_connections": [], "jetpack_featured_media_url": "https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/itsmylife.jpg?fit=1011%2C1024&ssl=1", "jetpack_sharing_enabled": true, "jetpack_shortlink": "https://wp.me/p9w3Lk-7KJ", "jetpack_likes_enabled": true, "jetpack-related-posts": [{"id": 31243, "url": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/12/04/cover-me-pretty-flamingo/", "url_meta": {"origin": 29805, "position": 0}, "title": "Cover Me: Pretty Flamingo", "author": "Ken", "date": "December 4, 2021", "format": false, "excerpt": "In one of his very best covers, Bruce lingers in that very first moment of infatuation.", "rel": "", "context": "In &quot;Cover Me&quot;", "block_context": {"text": "Cover Me", "link": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/category/cover-me/"}, "img": {"alt_text": "", "src": "https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/flamingo.jpg?fit=1000%2C1000&ssl=1&resize=350%2C200", "width": 350, "height": 200, "srcset": "https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/flamingo.jpg?fit=1000%2C1000&ssl=1&resize=350%2C200 1x, https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/flamingo.jpg?fit=1000%2C1000&ssl=1&resize=525%2C300 1.5x, https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/flamingo.jpg?fit=1000%2C1000&ssl=1&resize=700%2C400 2x"}, "classes": []}, {"id": 55371, "url": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2024/12/20/kingdom-of-days-december-20/", "url_meta": {"origin": 29805, "position": 1}, "title": "Kingdom of Days: December 20", "author": "Ken", "date": "December 20, 2024", "format": false, "excerpt": "Listen to a 1974 interview, a legendary '78 concert, and watch a 1994 holiday show appearance--all from this date.", "rel": "", "context": "In &quot;Kingdom of Days&quot;", "block_context": {"text": "Kingdom of Days", "link": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/category/kingdom-of-days/"}, "img": {"alt_text": "", "src": "https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/19781220_3_front.jpg?fit=805%2C706&ssl=1&resize=350%2C200", "width": 350, "height": 200, "srcset": "https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/19781220_3_front.jpg?fit=805%2C706&ssl=1&resize=350%2C200 1x, https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/19781220_3_front.jpg?fit=805%2C706&ssl=1&resize=525%2C300 1.5x, https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/19781220_3_front.jpg?fit=805%2C706&ssl=1&resize=700%2C400 2x"}, "classes": []}, {"id": 61239, "url": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2025/10/27/kingdom-of-days-october-27-2/", "url_meta": {"origin": 29805, "position": 2}, "title": "Kingdom of Days: October 27", "author": "Ken", "date": "October 27, 2025", "format": false, "excerpt": "Happy Birthday, Garry Tallent, born on this day in 1949.
