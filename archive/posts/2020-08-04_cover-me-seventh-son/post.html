<p>When the Working on a Dream Tour stopped in Greensboro, Bruce honored a sign request from a young boy who, I suspect, had a little bit of prompting from his parents.</p>
<p>The boy was holding a sign for “Seventh Son,” written by Willie Dixon and first recorded by Willie Mabel in 1955 in an R&amp;B arrangement.</p>

<p>It was Johnny Rivers’ rocking cover of it a decade later that propelled the song into the charts, however–it spent most of the summer of 1965 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, where it peaked at #7.</p>

<p>As classic rock songs go, “Seventh Son” is a bit on the obscure side, and Bruce was clearly skeptical about where the boy had heard the song.</p>
<p>But he was also tickled, and never one to back away from a challenge, Bruce gamely rallied the E Street Band for their first and only cover of “Seventh Son.”</p>
