(It&#8217;s not as overt as the identical riff, but the first four lines of each verse also bear a certain musical similarity between the two songs.)</p>\n<p>Bruce made on-stage appearances with Joe and The Houserockers on &#8220;Labor of Love&#8221; too, nightly throughout Joe&#8217;s 1995 October Assault mini-tour in support of the new album&#8211;including an appearance at Tramps in New York
