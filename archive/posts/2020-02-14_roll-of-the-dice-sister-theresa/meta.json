But under either name, the band was known for their sets filled with hard rocking, Springsteen-penned original songs punctuated by blistering guitar jams.</p>\n<p>But there were exceptions.</p>\n<p>At the tail end of the summer of &#8217;69, three days shy of his 20th birthday in Richmond, Virginia, Bruce gave his electric guitar a rest, along with half the band.</p>\n<p>Switching to his acoustic guitar, accompanied primarily by Vini Lopez on (of all things) the recorder, Bruce performed a remarkable original song about an infatuation with a Catholic nun. (Even then, Bruce&#8217;s songs were inescapably infused with religious imagery.)</p>\n<p>You can listen to that first performance by Child below, but I suggest skipping ahead &#8211;there&#8217;s a much, much better recording a little further down.</p>\n<div id=\"v-ErLSO8GL-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='426' src='https://videopress.com/embed/ErLSO8GL?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>As far as we know, the boys only played &#8220;Sister Theresa&#8221; twice&#8211;the debut performance with Child above, and a second with Steel Mill the following year. (Set lists are notoriously hard to come by from this era, however, so it&#8217;s very likely that &#8220;Sister Theresa&#8221; had other outings that were not recorded.)</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s that second, superior performance&#8211;although we can&#8217;t precisely date it, this one is very much worth a listen.</p>\n<!--[if lt IE 9]><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\">document.createElement('audio');</script><![endif]-->\n<audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-15953-1\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/08-Sister-Teresa.mp3?_=1\" /><a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/08-Sister-Teresa.mp3\">https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/08-Sister-Teresa.mp3</a></audio>\n<p>Gentle and tentative, 19-year-old Bruce Springsteen&#8217;s lyrics (the lyrics in the 1970 performance are identical to the earlier one) walk a tightrope between fantasy and worship. He can&#8217;t help but see Sister Teresa as a woman, and he can&#8217;t reconcile her celibate devotion.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Sister Theresa, golden hair all tucked away</em><br />\n<em>Sister Theresa, she&#8217;s dressed in black</em><br />\n<em>With rosary beads strung &#8217;round her neck</em><br />\n<em>What you need&#8217;s a man to love</em><br />\n<em>Can you tell what I&#8217;m thinking of</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Sister Theresa, feeling her way back home</em><br />\n<em>Sister Theresa, up in the morning saying her prayers</em><br />\n<em>Sister Theresa, revealing herself to the midnight air</em></p>\n<p>The artistic heart of the song is in the bridge, in which Bruce struggles to comprehend Theresa&#8217;s devotional sacrifice of earthly pleasures through a lens that could only belong to a nineteen-year-old boy:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>You say you&#8217;re married to Jesus Christ</em><br />\n<em>And that he&#8217;s in your bedroom every night</em><br />\n<em>Why is he so hard, why does he treat you so cruel</em><br />\n<em>Is he jealous or just a fool</em></p>\n<p>And if the payoff is predictable, at least it comes off more sweet than sly. Chalk that up to the earnestness of Bruce&#8217;s vocals and the inherent innocence of Vini&#8217;s recorder. (I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s possible to make that instrument sound sexy.)</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Sister Theresa, come with me for a while</em><br />\n<em>I promise I&#8217;ll make you smile</em><br />\n<em>Mother Superior, come and see</em><br />\n<em>Sister Frances, come and see</em><br />\n<em>Mother Superior, come and see</em><br />\n<em>Sister Frances, come and see</em><br />\n<em>She is gone, she is gone</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Sister Theresa, I&#8217;ve given you my heart</em></p>\n<p>Never recorded and rarely performed, &#8220;Sister Theresa&#8221; is too atypical of Bruce&#8217;s contemporary writing to ignore but not significant enough to merit memorializing. If notable for anything, it serves as a signpost toward softer, more contemplative songs like &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/05/12/roll-of-the-dice-mary-queen-of-arkansas/\">Mary, Queen of Arkansas</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/12/28/roll-of-the-dice-if-i-was-the-priest/\">If I Was the Priest</a>&#8221; that lie ahead a couple of years down the road.</p>\n<p><strong>Sister Theresa<br />\nNever recorded</strong><br />\n<strong>Never released</strong><br />\n<strong>First performed:</strong> September 20, 1969 (Richmond, VA)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> 1970 (exact date uncertain)</p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
