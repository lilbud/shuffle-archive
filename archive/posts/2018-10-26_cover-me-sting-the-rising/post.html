<p>In 2009, the Kennedy Center Honors recognized Bruce for his lasting impact on and contributions to American culture through the arts. The president and first lady were present, seated directly next to Bruce while a star-studded line-up paid tribute by performing Bruce’s music.</p>
<p>Among the line-up: Bruce’s good friend Sting, who chose one of Bruce’s most important 21st century compositions: “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/11/21/roll-of-the-dice-the-rising/">The Rising</a>.”</p>
<p>Backed by a full choir, Sting did Bruce proud and then some. Just watch–even more powerful than Sting’s performance are the reactions it provoked in the audience–some with smiles, some through tears, all were moved to their feet.</p>
<p>What a surreal and emotional moment that must have been for Bruce–watch his face and you can almost read his thoughts.</p>
