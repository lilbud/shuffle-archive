He&#8217;s had a string of hit country albums and won dozens of awards in his home country across his decades-long career.</p>\n<p>Kimber was relatively new to the scene when she filmed that duet with Cassar-Daley, but she&#8217;s amassed a loyal following of her own both solo and with her band The Rollin&#8217; Wheel.</p>\n<p>When performed as a duet, &#8220;I&#8217;m on Fire&#8221; transforms from a song about obsession to one of connection, and their gentle, rolling arrangement creates a cool, romantic vibe.</p>\n<p>Moving over to the European continent, let&#8217;s make a stop in Berlin and watch The Unknown Neighbour translate Bruce&#8217;s song from guitar to solo piano and harmonica in this 2015 video.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Unknown Neighbour \u2013 I&#039;m on Fire (Piano Cover)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Nlh1nehX3xI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>The Unknown Neighbour is singer-songwriter Sascha Zemke, and over the past few years he&#8217;s released a string of singles and an EP of his own music (well worth checking out <a href=\"https://unknownneighbour.com/\">here</a>).</p>\n<p>His cover of &#8220;I&#8217;m on Fire&#8221; grew on me throughout its three minutes, and by the bridge I&#8217;d realized that his arrangement sounds very much like what I&#8217;d expect a Springsteen-arranged piano version to sound like. And oh, that coda&#8230; perfection.</p>\n<p>Next up: Italy. I filmed this video myself, at this year&#8217;s <em>Cover Me</em> contest in Bergamo last month, where Sardinian musician Simone Bernardini&#8217;s breathtaking performance was one of the event&#8217;s highlights. Simone leans into the dark, brooding core of Bruce&#8217;s song and plays up its more sinister elements, and it works tremendously well.</p>\n<div id=\"v-B9U2w0Xc-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='426' src='https://videopress.com/embed/B9U2w0Xc?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>Simone finished in sixth place overall with the competition&#8217;s judges, but he was a crowd favorite, finishing in second place in the theater audience vote.</p>\n<p>Moving on to the U.K., singer-songwriter Daniel Spiller and Mark Stanley team up for a captivating duet, released only a few weeks ago. Both Spiller and Stanley have powerful, high-register voices that underscore Bruce&#8217;s yearning lyrics, and I love the way their vocals intertwine.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"I&#039;m on fire Bruce Springsteen cover\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/i8cgHocP5a0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Next up: Irish singer-songwriter Megan O\u2019Neill.

With the most traditional arrangement of the versions we&#8217;ve listened to today, it forces me to bend my creative cover rule a bit, but come on: it&#8217;s early Phoebe Bridgers. That&#8217;s worth an exception, isn&#8217;t it?</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"I&#039;m on Fire by Bruce Springsteen LIVE @ The Echoplex by phoebe bridgers\" width=\"758\" height=\"400\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&#038;url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F90681730&#038;show_artwork=true&#038;maxheight=1000&#038;maxwidth=758\"></iframe></p>\n<p>That&#8217;s it for this <em>Cover Me Round-up </em>installment, but as long as artists keep gravitating to a select few songs in Bruce&#8217;s catalog, trust me: there will be more.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>It&#8217;s time for another trip around the world.
