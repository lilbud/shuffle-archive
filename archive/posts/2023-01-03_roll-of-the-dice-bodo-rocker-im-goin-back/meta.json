When you&#8217;ve got a song called &#8220;BoDo Rocker&#8221; (short for &#8220;Bo Diddley Rocker&#8221;), you already know it&#8217;s not about the words anyway.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s about the beat.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - I&#039;m Goin&#039; Back aka Bo Diddley Rocker - Unreleased Outtake\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z2K_UUntwtM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Bootleggers called it &#8220;I&#8217;m Goin&#8217; Back&#8221; since it&#8217;s the obvious chorus, but &#8220;BoDo Rocker&#8221; (as it&#8217;s called in the studio session logs) is a more apt title. This five-and-a-half-minute rave-up is even more of an homage to Bo Diddley than Bruce&#8217;s previous two tributes, &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/07/01/roll-of-the-dice-preachers-daughter/\">Preacher&#8217;s Daughter</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/04/04/roll-of-the-dice-shes-the-one/\">She&#8217;s the One</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Bruce starts us off with a wailing harmonica intro, but from the moment the band enters at the five-second mark, &#8220;BoDo Rocker&#8221; is a freight train that cannot be stopped.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve seen several attempts to transcribe the lyrics; I&#8217;m convinced all of them are way off. But since the vocals are buried so far in the mix, I&#8217;m not going to be of much help either. Like I said, though: the lyrics aren&#8217;t the point, because if you&#8217;re paying attention to the lyrics you&#8217;re missing out on the E Street Band at their Darkness-era peak.</p>\n<p>Bruce calls on every member of the band to keep that train barreling down the tracks. The Professor is all over his keys, Max is a veritable machine, The Big Man is on another plane, and Bruce&#8211;when he isn&#8217;t turning in one of his finest studio harmonica performances&#8211;sings like a man possessed. (I love his evil laugh when the song comes to a crashing halt.)</p>\n<p>Recorded in late 1977, &#8220;BoDo Rocker&#8221; never had a prayer of making it onto\u00a0<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/07/05/album-companion-darkness-on-the-edge-of-town/\"><em>Darkness on the Edge of Town</em></a>.
