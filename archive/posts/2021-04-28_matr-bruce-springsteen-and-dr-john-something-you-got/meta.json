Although he scored a major hit that same year with &#8220;I Like It Like That,&#8221; which went all the way to #2 on the Billboard Hot 100, Kenner never achieved any chart success with &#8220;Something You Got.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"CHRIS KENNER   Something You Got   1961\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LHVdP5Kx1D8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Kenner may not have had any chart success with his own version, but remarkably in the span of eleven months from the summer of 1964 to the summer of 1965, no less than <em>three </em>covers of &#8220;Something You Got&#8221; made the Billboard Hot 100&#8211;although none of them managed to crack the Top 40.</p>\n<p>First up was fellow New Orleans singer-songwriter Alvin Robinson, who took &#8220;Something You Got&#8221; to #52 in July 1964.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Alvin Robinson - Something You Got\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ogr6bDMhN20?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>In November, The Ramsey Lewis Trio took a run at it with a live, uptempo instrumental version and got as high as #63.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Something You Got (Live)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4AQEHHKP1GE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>And then in 1965, Chuck Jackson and Maxine Brown turned &#8220;Something You Got&#8221; into a sultry duet.

And no one was bigger on the New Orleans music scene than Dr. John.</p>\n<p>Dr. John covered &#8220;Something You Got&#8221; in a decidedly uptempo arrangement on his 1979 album, <em>Tango Palace,\u00a0</em>and he covered it in concert from time to time in the 1980s.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Something You Got\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fnoLMRaeOYY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Throughout all that time and a couple of decades beyond, Bruce never crossed paths with Dr. John on stage (except for a brief guest appearance when Dr. John was\u00a0 a member of Ringo Starr&#8217;s All Starr Band in 1989). But in 2012, Bruce and Dr. John both happened to be playing Jazz Fest, and their stars finally aligned.</p>\n<p>Bruce brought Dr. John on stage in the middle of his set, and of course the song they played was &#8220;Something You Got.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Something You Got - Bruce Springsteen with Dr John @ Jazzfest NOLA  - 29 April 2012\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3voBKJraaeg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>It might be my imagination, but Bruce looks more than just tickled to be on stage with Dr. John&#8211;he looks like he very much remembers those early &#8217;70s performances, even though four decades separate them.</p>\n<p>They played it slow that night&#8211;slower than Bruce and the band would likely have played on their own (as Bruce admitted afterward)&#8211;but Dr. John had the superpower to summon the groove.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Something You Got&#8221; turned out to be a highlight of the evening&#8230; a highlight forty years in the making.</p>\n<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> Bruce played &#8220;Something You Got&#8221; once more since that night with Dr. John, and this time was a team-up too. At the Asbury Park Music &amp; Film Festival in 2017, Bruce joined Southside Johnny, Little Steven, and a host of local legends in a one-time-only Upstage Jam Band to celebrate the legacy of the long-defunct club. Southside Johnny had covered &#8220;Something You Got&#8221; himself (on album with The Poor Fools and on stage with The Asbury Jukes), and he and Bruce were the focal points for that particular number.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Something You Got\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NglYuD-Hndc?feature=oembed\"
