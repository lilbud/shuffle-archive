**2014:** At the Cynthia Woods Mitchell Pavilion in Houston, one of the smaller venues on the High Hopes Tour, Bruce plans to open the show with "[This Is Your Sword](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/02/04/roll-of-the-dice-this-is-your-sword/)." Luckily, Tom Morello has a better idea: as they walk on stage, Tom suggests to Bruce that he open with "[Seeds](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/10/10/roll-of-the-dice-seeds/)" instead, setting the tone for a high-energy show that features a guest spot by Joe Ely and the tour debut of "[All or Nothin' at All](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/01/30/roll-of-the-dice-all-or-nothing-at-all/)" and "[One Step Up](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/08/17/roll-of-the-dice-one-step-up/)."
