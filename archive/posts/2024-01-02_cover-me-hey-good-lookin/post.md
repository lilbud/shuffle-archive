meta-description: Bruce’s one and only cover of “Hey, Good Lookin'” was a bit of a hot mess, but that’s its charm. Take a listen inside.

By now, we shouldn’t be surprised at the range of covers Bruce Springsteen is prone to playing in concert.

Still, “Hey, Good Lookin’,” Hank Williams’ #1 country hit from 1951, seems like one of the least likely contenders. (It’s certainly tough to imagine a fan bringing a sign for it.)

Bruce did play it live, though–one time only–and it wasn’t even on the Seeger Sessions Tour where one might expect it.

Nope, this one was in Asbury Park, at Bruce’s last show of the 20th century.

I wrote about that show last month when I shared Bruce’s soundchecked cover of another Hank Williams song, “.” Bruce’s cover of “Hey Good Lookin'” comes from the same rehearsal–in fact, it immediately followed “Jambalaya,” making for a Hank Williams double-header.

It’s more than a bit loose and messy, but that’s part of the charm. Take a listen to Bruce, Patti, Garry, Nils, Soozie, Lisa Lowell, and Southside Johnny on the harp having a ball and falling all over themselves:
