Bruce debuts a new song at his solo acoustic show in Kalamazoo… sort of. Before the show, a fan had requested “Highway Patrolman” and while Bruce planned to grant it, he knew he’d be blowing the STFU theme of his tour by playing it in Michigan, because audiences can’t help but cheer when their own state is mentioned. So instead of declining the request, he doubled down and wrote a song called “” backstage in the minutes leading up to the show. It shows.

One of the best shows of the Reunion Tour (we need an official release of this one!) takes place at the Philadelphia Spectrum the day after Bruce turns 50, and the birthday theme is established from the get-go: Bruce opens the show with a cassette recording of a special birthday song recorded by his mom’s next-door neighbor, followed immediately by the tour premiere of “.” It’s definitely an old-school night, with the band playing “” for the first time since the Darkness Tour and a show-closing “” for the first time since the Chicken Scratch Tour of 1976. “” makes its tour debut as well. This show was rescheduled due to inclement weather from a week prior, and the audience lucked out as a result.
