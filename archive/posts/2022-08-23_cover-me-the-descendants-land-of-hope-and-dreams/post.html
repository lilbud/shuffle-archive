<p>The Descendants hail from South Africa’s Eastern Cape. With twelve studio albums under their belts, Ingrid Potgieter (piano), Nicky Wilson (bass), and Melissa Larter (guitar and lead vocals) have amassed a considerable catalog of inspirational songs.</p>
<p>And when it comes to covers, they don’t get more inspirational than Bruce Springsteen’s “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/01/05/roll-of-the-dice-land-of-hope-and-dreams/">Land of Hope and Dreams</a>.”</p>

<p>Their version (recorded live) starts simply and acoustically, but just past the halfway point the song opens up, and the band takes off and never looks back. It’s a fine addition to the collection of covers of one of Bruce’s very best songs.</p>
