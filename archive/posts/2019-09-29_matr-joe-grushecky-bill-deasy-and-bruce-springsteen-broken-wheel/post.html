<p>But while “Another Thin Line” may be the only song on Joe’s 2009 album that features Bruce’s vocals, it’s not the only song to which Bruce contributed his talents.</p>
<p>Deep in the middle of the album, we find “Broken Wheel.”</p>

<p>Written and performed by Joe and fellow Pittsburgh singer/songwriter Bill Deasy, “Broken Wheel” is a song about a broken heart (for reasons I shall not spoil, but suffice to say this is not a love song), and it features Bruce prominently on lead guitar.</p>
<p>It’s a beautiful, powerful, and haunting song, with or without Bruce’s accompaniment, on an album that should be in every Springsteen fan’s collection.</p>
