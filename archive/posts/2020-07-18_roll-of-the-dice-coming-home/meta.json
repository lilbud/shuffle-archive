Early Bruce Springsteen Band set lists still featured some Steel Mill standards, and even some of Bruce&#8217;s newer songs felt like they were written more for his old band than his new one.</p>\n<p>Case in point: &#8220;Coming Home,&#8221; debuted by The Bruce Springsteen Band in the autumn of 1971, only a few months into their existence.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Coming Home&#8221; hewed closely to the Steel Mill formula, light on lyrics, heavy on the jam. But oh, what a jam. The band may have been new, but the players were not&#8211;by 1971 the young future E Streeters were already playing with peak skill, confidence, and ferocity.</p>\n<p>Take a listen to the first known performance of &#8220;Coming Home,&#8221; from the band&#8217;s Richmond appearance (Steel Mill had made something of a second home in Richmond, Virginia) on October 23, 1971, and marvel at Bruce&#8217;s fleet-fingered guitar solo.</p>\n<div id=\"v-xTCZDRHO-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='568' src='https://videopress.com/embed/xTCZDRHO?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>&#8220;Coming Home&#8221; made a couple more appearances that winter (that we know about, at least&#8211;few of those early set lists are documented), but it&#8217;s the remarkable studio recording that demands our close attention.</p>\n<p>Studio recording, you ask? Surprisingly, yes: while no &#8220;official&#8221; studio records from the Bruce Springsteen Band era were ever issued, the band frequently rehearsed at Tinker West&#8217;s rehearsal room/studio/surfboard factory, and on at least one occasion, Tinker recorded and preserved the band&#8217;s sessions.</p>\n<p>Only eight songs from those sessions circulate, but they are wonderfully clear documents of that brief but vibrant period in Bruce&#8217;s musical evolution. (Longtime readers know how partial I am to the Bruce Springsteen Band era.)</p>\n<p>One of the final songs recorded at the March 14, 1972 rehearsal session was &#8220;Coming Home,&#8221; tighter and more lyrically evolved than the band&#8217;s earlier live performances. The recording lacks some of the frenetic energy of the &#8217;71 performances, but it more than makes up for it in clarity. Sancious, in particular, makes his presence known here much more so than in the earlier performances.</p>\n<div id=\"v-fBhdBSB6-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='568' src='https://videopress.com/embed/fBhdBSB6?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>Bruce wrote &#8220;Coming Home&#8221; at a time when the nation and his generation were inescapably influenced by the ongoing conflict in Vietnam, but while most of Bruce&#8217;s earlier war songs dripped with pathos, rage, or cynicism, &#8220;Coming Home&#8221; is much more subtle in its commentary&#8211;a listener encountering it for the first time today might mistake it for a &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/05/20/cover-me-born-to-be-wild/\">Born to Be Wild</a>&#8220;-style road song.</p>\n<p>Bruce&#8217;s narrator in &#8220;Coming Home&#8221; lives on the poor side of town. Looking for a life of adventure, he falls sway to the army&#8217;s recruitment pitch, and before long they put a rifle in his hand and ship him off to a foreign land.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well now, living ain&#8217;t easy on this side of the highway</em><br />\n<em>Trying to get a hold on life</em><br />\n<em>The thing that you want is to have your fun</em><br />\n<em>First they show you the gun and then they show you the lie</em><br />\n<em>Ah but things are gonna change</em><br />\n<em>Things are changing every day</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I&#8217;m just a lone boy on the highway</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;ll try to make my own</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;m just a lone boy on the highway</em><br />\n<em>Oh God I feel so alone now</em><br />\n<em>But I&#8217;m coming home</em></p>\n<p>By this point in Bruce&#8217;s young musical career, his songwriting was mature and subtle enough to operate on two levels, as anti-war commentary and an open-road rocker. Bruce effortlessly switches context and geography from verse to chorus, flashing forward to the returned soldier, emotionally isolated by his experiences and yearning for a home he knows deep down he can&#8217;t ever truly return to.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I don&#8217;t wanna go back to Kansas</em><br />\n<em>I don&#8217;t wanna go there no more</em><br />\n<em>I don&#8217;t think I could stand it</em><br />\n<em>First they show you the gun and then they show you the door</em><br />\n<em>Ah but things are gonna change</em><br />\n<em>Things are changing every day</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well I don&#8217;t wanna go back</em><br />\n<em>I don&#8217;t think I can ever go back again</em><br />\n<em>I don&#8217;t wanna go back</em><br />\n<em>I won&#8217;t go back and ever see her face again</em><br />\n<em>Mama I&#8217;m going home</em><br />\n<em>I won&#8217;t talk about it</em></p>\n<p>There&#8217;s only the hint of allusion to the life (and love?) he left behind&#8211;our narrator won&#8217;t let himself resume it, yet he&#8217;s unable to fully let go. That sense of alienation among battle-scarred veterans was only starting to become recognized, but Bruce already understood it enough to write about it at the age of 22.</p>\n<p><span class=\"text-info\">During the final chorus, our narrator is still struggling, standing outside his former home but too fearful or ashamed to enter. Bruce sings (in a line not present in the earlier live recordings), &#8220;I&#8217;m just a boy trying to get one foot in the door. Mama, I&#8217;m coming home&#8211;get me.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p>We never learn whether he makes it home, though&#8211;the song leaves our soldier with no place to run, nowhere to go.</p>\n<p>While &#8220;Coming Home&#8221; never saw the light of day (officially), it wouldn&#8217;t be the last time Bruce would write about a returning Vietnam veteran.</p>\n<p>But in 1972, <a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/09/21/roll-of-the-dice-born-in-the-u-s-a/\">that story</a> was still burning ten years down the road.</p>\n<p><strong>Coming Home<br />\nRecorded:</strong> March 14, 1972<br />\n<strong>Never released</strong><br />\n<strong>First performed:</strong> October 23, 1971 (Richmond, VA)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> February 25, 1972 (Richmond, VA)</p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
