Recently, I shared a of “” by Emmylou Harris and Willie Nelson, and almost immediately, a few friends and readers pointed me to another Emmylou duet/Bruce cover. And even though Emmylou has covered Bruce enough times to make for a mini-blog by itself, this particular track deserves more listens.

This cover of “” combines not just two but great voices: Emmylou, Linda Ronstadt, and Neil Young (who hangs out on backing vocals but contributes a prominent harmonica).

From Linda and Emmylou’s 1999 album of duets, this is “Across the Border.”

It’s no wonder Bruce invited Emmylou to sing it with him at Giants Stadium in 2003.
