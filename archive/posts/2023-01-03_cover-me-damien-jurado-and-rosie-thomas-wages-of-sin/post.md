Okay, I think we’ve given enough spotlight to Bruce’s pop hits of late, so let’s give “” and “” a rest and listen to some great deep cut covers for a bit.

[I’m on Fire](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/09/11/roll-of-the-dice-im-on-fire/)[Dancing in the Dark](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/12/25/roll-of-the-dice-dancing-in-the-dark/)

And cuts don’t get much deeper than “,” Bruce’s haunting outtake that finally saw official release in 1998.

[Wages of Sin](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/02/07/roll-of-the-dice-wages-of-sin/)*Born in the U.S.A.*

There aren’t many covers of this song out there. In fact, I only know of one: this gorgeous version by Seattle singer-songwriter Damien Jurado and Rosie Thomas.

Heck, even the cover is a deep cut: it’s a bonus track on a tribute compilation released by Sub Pop at the turn of the century. (Yeah, I know the original was recorded post-, but Bruce wrote and demoed it during his period, so we can give it a pass.)

I’ve always thought that “Wages of Sin” felt like a dance between two wary lovers, circling each other across a widening gulf of emotional distance and distrust. Damien and Rosie’s duet dials directly into that sentiment, their interwoven vocals drawing us into their heartache more potently than a single voice can accomplish, even when that voice is Bruce’s.

It’s a beautiful cover of a undeservedly overlooked song.
