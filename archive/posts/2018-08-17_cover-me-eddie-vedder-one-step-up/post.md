Before Pearl Jam there was Bad Radio. They never released an album, but Bad Radio still has a claim to fame: their frontman was Eddie Vedder.

And even in his Bad Radio days, Eddie was a Springsteen fan. He recorded this lovely cover of “” in a friend’s recording studio in Chicago sometime in the late 1980s.
