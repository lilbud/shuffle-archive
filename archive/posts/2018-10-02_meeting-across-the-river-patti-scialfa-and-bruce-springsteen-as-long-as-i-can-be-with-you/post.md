Spotlight on Patti Scialfa today (but Bruce is standing right behind her).

Patti's *Rumble Doll* album was a tremendous debut, firmly establishing her singer/songwriter chops completely outside the shadow of her more famous husband. One of the best songs (and singles) off the album: "As Long as I (Can Be With You)."

Although Bruce doesn't play on the studio track, he occasionally teased the song with Patti during the band intro break in "[Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/11/19/roll-of-the-dice-tenth-avenue-freeze-out/)" during the Reunion Tour.

More than a decade after its release, Bruce took his first full run through the song in April 2004, supporting Patti at her show at the Hit Factory in New York, celebrating the release of her second album.

Bruce and Patti performed the song a few more times together that fall–the final time at the closing show of the Vote for Change Tour, where Patti opened.

I'm still hoping for a Patti solo tour someday so I can hear this song live–let's hope we'll see it soon.
