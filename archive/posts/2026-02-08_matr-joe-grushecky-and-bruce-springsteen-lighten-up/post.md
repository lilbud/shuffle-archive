Today’s meeting across the river comes from the city of three rivers: Pittsburgh, PA.

For a brief time in 1995, Bruce Springsteen joined Joe Grushecky and the Houserockers, taking a supporting role during Joe’s tour. (Bruce produced the album, played and sang on several tracks, and wrote two of them.)

*American Babylon*

This audio clip is the final encore from the October 20, 1995 show at Nick’s Fat City, “Lighten Up” from Joe’s album, . Bruce is on background vocals and guitar, but you can hear him clearly. The song starts about a minute in.
