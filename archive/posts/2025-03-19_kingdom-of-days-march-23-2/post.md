All that plus a one-off cover of “” Watch Bruce soundcheck below.

Live premieres galore (six album tracks and two covers, including “” with John Eddie) at the first rehearsal show for the Working on a Dream Tour at Asbury Park’s Convention Hall, as the E Street Band embarks on a six-year growth spurt with the addition of Curtis King, Cindy Mizelle, and part-timer Jay Weinberg. Surprisingly, Bruce will drop most of his new material from the set list early in the tour, so these early shows feature rare opportunities to hear them live.
