<p>Nevertheless, those are unmistakably Bruce Springsteen’s backing vocals on “Angel Eyes,” Little Steven’s standout track from his 1982 debut album, <em>Men Without Women</em>.</p>

<p>Although technically billed as The Disciples of Soul, that’s not actually the band that you hear on most of the album. Steve didn’t assemble the Disciples until the album was almost complete, and while the album features E Streeters, Asbury Jukes, and Miami Horns, “Angel Eyes” is pretty close to an E Street Band song, with prominent contributions from Max, Garry, and Danny that are even easier to pick out than Bruce’s vocals.</p>
<p>Bruce has made and continues to make frequent appearances at Little Steven’s shows, but unlike “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/11/17/meeting-across-the-river-little-steven-and-bruce-springsteen-until-the-good-is-gone/">Until the Good is Gone</a>” (one of Bruce’s two other vocal contributions to his best friend’s debut album and an occasional on-stage team-up), and despite its reliable inclusion in Little Steven’s setlists, “Angel Eyes” remains untouched by Bruce in concert.</p>
