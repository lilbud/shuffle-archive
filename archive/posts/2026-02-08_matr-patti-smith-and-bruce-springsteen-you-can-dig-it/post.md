title: You Can Dig It
---

Let’s take another trip back to the remarkable night of Friday, November 26, 1976 at the Bottom Line club in New York City.

That night, The Patti Smith Group plays two shows, and Bruce is there for both of them, joining the band on both guitar and piano several times during the evening.

Among the songs Patti plays that night are some highly improvisational and ephemeral improv piece, including this one, referred to on bootlegs as “You Can Dig It.”

They played it twice that night (and never again), and both were captured on tape. Patti’s vocals are bit muddy and tough to make out at times, but Bruce’s guitar is crystal clear (especially in the latter performance)–you can hear him keeping pace with and matching Patti’s monologue, and at times, we’re not sure who’s tracking who.

Take a listen to both performances below, and for more Bruce and Patti from this night, see “Slowly Walking Down by the River” and “Picture Hanging Blues.”
