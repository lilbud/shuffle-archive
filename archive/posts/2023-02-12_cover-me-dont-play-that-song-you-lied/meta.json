King.</p>\n<p>A year earlier, King had the seed for a song destined to become an enduring standard. With the help of famed songwriters Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, King developed &#8220;Stand By Me&#8221; and made it an instant hit.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Ben E.

Eight years later, Aretha Franklin notched the same #11 peak when she recorded a cover in a completely different, more swinging arrangement.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Aretha Franklin - Don&#039;t Play That Song (You Lied) [1970]\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6ktFUwPGWag?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Today, both King&#8217;s and Franklin&#8217;s versions are considered definitive, but as popular as they were, neither directly inspired Bruce&#8217;s cover on <em>Only the Strong Survive</em>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There\u2019s a crazy beach version of it,&#8221; Bruce told Chris Jordan for the <em>Asbury Park Press, </em>&#8220;and I\u2019m forgetting the artist\u2019s name at the time, but it was like a little wedding version of it with a drum machine and it had that shuffling rhythm. I said, &#8216;Wow, that\u2019s a great rhythm to sing that song in.&#8217; I have to find out who we\u2019re copying there.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure if Bruce ever publicly acknowledged which version caught his imagination so strongly, but this 1969 version by Derrick Morgan is a compelling candidate.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"DERRICK MORGAN - Don&#039;t play that song [1969 - Crab]\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7LeCzu3oJzk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Whatever the inspiration, Bruce definitely leaned in to the beach vibe. With a galvanizing horn section in place of the more sentimental strings and a mid-song patter that claims the song for the Jersey Shore, Bruce&#8217;s cover sounds more like something we&#8217;d hear at a boardwalk bar than anything else on his 2022 album.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Don&#039;t Play That Song (Official Video)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6bM3L296ZNw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>We knew Bruce had a particular fondness for &#8220;Don&#8217;t Play That Song&#8221; when he produced that video and debuted a similar ensemble on\u00a0<em>The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon</em> shortly after.
