James is still Remington-born, and he still does a stint in Richfield Prison. But whereas in &#8220;Jim Deer&#8221; our protagonist ends up behind bars for the cruel crime he commits, in &#8220;Richfield Whistle,&#8221; James Lucas has already served his sentence.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>My name is James Lucas</em><br />\n<em>I was born in Remington</em><br />\n<em>And paroled from Richfield Prison</em><br />\n<em>In the winter of &#8217;81</em><br />\n<em>I was free and on the streets of Indiana</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;d just turned 32</em><br />\n<em>Same man with nowhere left to run</em><br />\n<em>No different, sir, than you</em></p>\n<p>Released from prison for good behavior, Jimmy marries Pat and does his best with his wife to make ends meet. Unlike Jimmy and Terry, who &#8220;got by all right on the money that we made,&#8221; Jimmy and Pat worked just as hard only to fall further and further behind.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Me and Pat, we married in the spring</em><br />\n<em>Moved in with her Ma and Pa</em><br />\n<em>On our wedding night she sighed, &#8220;Jimmy,</em><br />\n<em>We can have anything we want.&#8221;</em><br />\n<em>It was for those things we wanted</em><br />\n<em>We worked as hard as two people could</em><br />\n<em>But somehow in the end, mister,</em><br />\n<em>This didn&#8217;t do no good</em></p>\n<p>To fully appreciate the evolution in Bruce&#8217;s songwriting, it&#8217;s important to understand the very different character portrait Bruce draws with almost the exact same words. (Bruce reverts to his earlier exposition from &#8220;James Lincoln Dear&#8221; to paint a character with integrity rather than the thief who stars in the released version of &#8220;Jim Deer.&#8221;)</p>\n<p>What happens to good people when outside forces make it impossible to survive when you play by the rules? It&#8217;s a question that obviously fascinated Springsteen; he&#8217;d ask it again and again as recently as &#8220;Swallowed Up (In the Belly of the Whale.)&#8221;</p>\n<p>The newly freed James Lucas almost immediately starts making moral compromises, rationalizing and justifying as he skims from his decent but wealthy employer.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>The prison got me drivin&#8217; delivery</em><br />\n<em>For Mr. Wills over in Ridgeside</em><br />\n<em>Well, I started loadin&#8217; a little extra</em><br />\n<em>And I&#8217;d sell it on the side</em><br />\n<em>I didn&#8217;t like what I was doin&#8217;</em><br />\n<em>I didn&#8217;t lose no sleep at night</em><br />\n<em>Mr. Wills, he was a rich man</em><br />\n<em>He&#8217;d been a rich man all his life</em></p>\n<p>Jimmy knows he&#8217;s doing the wrong thing, but he doesn&#8217;t recognize he&#8217;s on a slippery slope. One moral compromise leads to another, a classic noir theme that Bruce later employed in songs like &#8220;The Big Muddy&#8221; and &#8220;The Line.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Inevitably, Jimmy is found out. His boss confronts him but has mercy on him, simply firing him when he also could have had him arrested.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I was on the loading dock one evening</em><br />\n<em>When I heard the warehouse phone</em><br />\n<em>The dispatcher said, &#8220;Jim, they wanna see you</em><br />\n<em>In the front office &#8216;fore you go home.&#8221;</em><br />\n<em>All Mr. Wills said was, &#8220;I don&#8217;t understand.</em><br />\n<em>I could send you back to Richfield fast.</em><br />\n<em>If you needed some extra money, Jim,</em><br />\n<em>All you had to do was ask.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p><em>All you had to do was ask.\u00a0</em>Those words undoubtedly echoed in Jimmy&#8217;s head that night. His brother-in-law Syl said the same thing in &#8220;Jim Deer,&#8221; leading Jimmy astray. The symmetry is ironic. Jimmy landed in prison because he asked for a way to make extra money; now he&#8217;s lost his job because he didn&#8217;t ask.</p>\n<p>Jimmy and Pat argue, and Jimmy drives off with only a bottle and ten dollars to his name. He stops at a quiet liquor store along the highway and gets out. Because Bruce is careful to tell us that Jimmy left the motor running, we tense up. Whatever&#8217;s about to happen, we know it requires a fast getaway.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well, that night me and Pat, we had a fight</em><br />\n<em>I was out drivin&#8217; &#8217;round in the rain</em><br />\n<em>With a fifth of gin and a half-tank of gas</em><br />\n<em>And ten dollars to my name</em><br />\n<em>I passed a deserted liquor store</em><br />\n<em>Way out on Highway One</em><br />\n<em>I turned and pulled into that parking lot</em><br />\n<em>Got out but I let my motor run</em></p>\n<p>Over the course of the song, Bruce has steadily and deliberately planted seeds: we know that Jimmy is an ex-con, we know he resorted to theft even after his parole, we know he&#8217;s jobless, desperate, angry, and probably under the influence.\u00a0\u00a0At this point, it seems we are clearly in &#8220;Johnny 99&#8221; territory.</p>\n<p>But here comes the curveball.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well, I stood lookin&#8217; in the window</em><br />\n<em>For a long, long while</em><br />\n<em>When I walked in the man behind the register</em><br />\n<em>He looked at me and smiled</em><br />\n<em>&#8220;That&#8217;s some weather we&#8217;re havin&#8217; out there.</em><br />\n<em>Can I help you find somethin&#8217;, friend?&#8221;</em><br />\n<em>I didn&#8217;t answer, I just stood there</em><br />\n<em>Then I turned around and went</em></p>\n<p>Jimmy walks into the liquor store with every intention of robbing it. Something stops him, though. Perhaps it&#8217;s the decency of the proprietor; maybe it&#8217;s the voice of his former boss in his head: <em>all you had to do was ask</em>. Or maybe he simply recognized who he was becoming.</p>\n<p>Whatever the reason, Jimmy turns away from temptation and returns home.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I don&#8217;t know how long I sat in my driveway</em><br />\n<em>My shirt was covered in sweat</em><br />\n<em>The house was dark when I went in</em><br />\n<em>Pat was lyin&#8217; awake in bed</em><br />\n<em>She hit the light, I was standin&#8217; in the doorway</em><br />\n<em>She said, &#8220;I was worried, where you been so long?&#8221;</em><br />\n<em>I felt her arms around me</em><br />\n<em>She said, &#8220;Jimmy, I&#8217;m so glad you&#8217;re home.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>Jimmy made the right call, but it wasn&#8217;t an easy one. He and Pat are still in dire straits, and he knows he&#8217;ll be called upon to make that same decision day after day after day. Bruce will return to this theme&#8211;the eternal struggle with one&#8217;s inner demons&#8211;again and again, in songs like &#8220;Cautious Man&#8221; and &#8220;Straight Time.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Jimmy goes to bed, but lays awake in the night thinking, like the protagonist of &#8220;Wreck on the Highway.&#8221; As he drifts off finally to sleep, he hears the prison whistle&#8211;still fresh in his memory&#8211;warning him that Richfield still waits for him should he succumb to temptation.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Richfield Prison stands on a high hill</em><br />\n<em>Where the county line runs out</em><br />\n<em>And there&#8217;s a whistle that blows every time a man comes in</em><br />\n<em>Or a man gets out</em><br />\n<em>At night we lay wrapped in each other&#8217;s arms</em><br />\n<em>Listenin&#8217; to the rain</em><br />\n<em>I heard that Richfield whistle blowin&#8217;</em><br />\n<em>Just blowin&#8217; in my dreams</em></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s an unsettling ending, one that sticks with us much longer than the resolution of &#8220;Jim Deer.&#8221; Ultimately, neither song would be released, but both would directly influence an officially released gem more than a decade later.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll take a listen to that one in a few days.</p>\n<p><strong>Richfield Whistle<br />\nRecorded:</strong> April 24, 1983<br />\n<strong>Released:\u00a0</strong><em>L.A.
