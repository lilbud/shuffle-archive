<p>Even though we know Bruce has covered countless songs across a spectrum of styles, most of us still wouldn’t expect Ernest Tubb’s “Waltz Across Texas” to be on that list.</p>

<p>“Waltz Across Texas” was something of a local favorite and one of Tubb’s most well-known and most-requested songs, even though it never rose higher than #34 when Tubb released it in 1965 and disappeared from the charts entirely after seven weeks.</p>
<p>In that era when music was still regional, that was probably too short a time for Bruce to have noticed “Waltz Across Texas” during its original release. But when Bruce brought the E Street Band to Austin during the River Tour, someone slipped him one of Tubb’s albums backstage, and Bruce listened to it.</p>
<p>He must have been taken with “Waltz Across Texas,” because during the encores that night, he debuted his first and only cover of it as the night’s penultimate song.</p>

<p>Bruce’s arrangement was traditional, and his vocals warm and wonderful. The E Street Band played with respectful restraint, and Clarence’s sax solo was a natural fit.</p>
<p>It was a serendipitous one-off, and we’re fortunate that it was captured on tape.</p>
