<div data-mh="110" data-mhc="1">A good cover can make you hear a favorite song in a new light. Here’s a powerful example:</div>
<p>Elysium is an Irish cover band out of Wexford with a wide-ranging repertoire of acoustically arranged hits and deep cuts, featuring beautiful guitar melodies paired with gorgeous harmonies.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, they released their poignant, mesmerizing cover of Bruce’s “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/02/27/roll-of-the-dice-drive-all-night/">Drive All Night.</a>” By the end of it, I was in tears.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSjfLsBerj0">Watch on Youtube: Drive All Night by Elysium</a></p>
<p>That segue you hear in the final minutes blends “Drive All Night” with the Scottish/Irish standard “The Parting Glass,” a traditional farewell to friends, family and loved ones.</p>
<p>By placing it in the context of “Drive All Night,” Elysium transforms Bruce’s song of young romance into something eternal: a pledge of remembrance to a love lost.</p>

<div data-mh="110" data-mhc="1">Released in the midst of the great pandemic of 2020, it’s hard not to hear their performance of “Drive All Night” in a completely different light–love laced with loss. It’s simultaneously healing and heart-aching.</div>

<div data-mh="110" data-mhc="1">“Drive All Night” has long been one of my favorite Springsteen songs, and now I have yet another reason to love it. Thanks for that, Elysium.</div>
