<p>Leave it to Portland:</p>
<p>An awesome venue, an energized crowd, but the roomiest, most spacious pit I’ve ever seen. It was awesome to have so much elbow/dancing room, but there were ridiculously few people for such a large space. It was dicey whether we could mass enough concentrated crowd for Bruce’s crowdsurf–but surf he did, and my friend Tjeerd and I were in prime position for it. (You can see the back of our heads front and center at 3:40 below, just before Bruce falls right on us.)</p>

<p>At the previous show in L.A., I was front and center in the pit. This time I was in the very back of it, but even that v<span class="text_exposed_show">antage point has close encounter potential–see my video below for the amazing close-up performance of “<a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/11/19/roll-of-the-dice-tenth-avenue-freeze-out/">Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out.</a>” (You’ll also hear just how good the sound was that night.)</span></p>

<p>As for the show itself: it was one of the shortest of the tour, only 33 songs (two less than usual for that leg) and only 3 hours and 18 minutes, with no surprises or unusual wildcards. Bruce’s voice seemed pinched at times–I suspect his throat was sore after 4 shows the week prior. But his performance didn’t suffer, and if the show fell short on time, it made up for it in intensity.</p>

<p>If this was my last show for that leg of the tour, I might have been a little disappointed at the relative predictability, but I had one more coming up in my adopted hometown of Seattle two nights later–and that show would prove to be one of the best of that leg.</p>
