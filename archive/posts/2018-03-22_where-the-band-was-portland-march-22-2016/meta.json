It was awesome to have so much elbow/dancing room, but there were ridiculously few people for such a large space. It was dicey whether we could mass enough concentrated crowd for Bruce&#8217;s crowdsurf&#8211;but surf he did, and my friend Tjeerd and I were in prime position for it. (You can see the back of our heads front and center at 3:40 below, just before Bruce falls right on us.)</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Hungry Heart Bruce Springsteen Portland March 22, 2016 Moda  Center\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JGNMrVRl9d4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>At the previous show in L.A., I was front and center in the pit.

Bruce&#8217;s voice seemed pinched at times&#8211;I suspect his throat was sore after 4 shows the week prior.
