But it&#8217;s enough to give us some insight into the song&#8217;s subject:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Sometimes at night I lie awake for a while</em><br />\n<em>Thinking and dreaming &#8217;bout when I was a small boy child</em><br />\n<em>Running and laughing as hard as I could</em><br />\n<em>Everything easy, everything good</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I&#8217;m older now that&#8217;s what the judge said</em><br />\n<em>As I walked through the county hall, through a window I fled</em><br />\n<em>The last thing that they did was put a price on my head</em><br />\n<em>Now alone, scared, and running for something I never did</em></p>\n<p>That&#8217;s a terrific opening. Note how Bruce deftly establishes a dreamlike, nostalgic first verse and contrasts it with a suspenseful escape from the law in the second, using a parallel &#8220;running&#8221; device to convey first freedom, then fright. Great songwriting there.</p>\n<p>Fascinatingly, we can also see Bruce&#8217;s first attempt at the second verse, crossed out, but still quite readable:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I&#8217;m older now, that&#8217;s what the judge said</em><br />\n<em>So now I walk the road with a price on my head</em><br />\n<em>The last thing that they did</em></p>\n<p>It looks like Bruce abandoned that version because he wanted to establish the escape as a contrasting device, but I actually like that version better. One of Bruce&#8217;s songwriting strengths is his ability to provide just enough context and then trust the listener to fill in the missing events. (See &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/03/23/roll-of-the-dice-highway-29/\">Highway 29</a>&#8221; for perhaps the best example of this.) Perhaps Bruce hadn&#8217;t honed that skill at the time, or perhaps he wasn&#8217;t quite so confident a songwriter yet. Either way, the &#8220;through a window I fled&#8221; replacement isn&#8217;t nearly as sure-footed as the rest of the song.</p>\n<p>But that&#8217;s a picked nit. The lyrics above are still a great set-up for a song that seems like it would have been a great <em>Nebraska</em> candidate, and I can only hope an audio recording turns up one day so we can hear what it finally became.</p>\n<p><strong>Sometimes at Night</strong><br />\n<strong>Never Recorded</strong><br />\n<strong>Never Released<br />\n</strong><strong>First performed:</strong> July 22, 1971 (South Amboy, NJ)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> July 22, 1971 (South Amboy, NJ)</p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
