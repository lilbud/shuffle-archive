Here’s the brand-new single from a brand-new band born during the great lockdown of 2020.

The Shining Tongues is the latest songwriting project from former Infinite Three founder Daniel Knowler, who ended his decade-long former group when one of its members passed away last year.

The Shining Tongues are in the process of recording their first album, but they’ve already released a couple of singles, including Knowler’s first cover: Bruce Springsteen’s “[State Trooper](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/12/22/roll-of-the-dice-state-trooper/).”

Knowler’s previous band classified themselves as noise rock, and his latest promises to add “drone-rock, psychedelia, spiritual jazz and soundtrack music” to the mix.

We can hear some of that at work in their cover of “State Trooper.” Bruce’s song was always a tormented and paranoid inner monologue, and Knowler’s cover dials that up like never before.

I’m looking forward to hearing what they bring to their first album.
