Tonight was likely to be safe and standard, with a few surprises on Night Two and a blow-out on Night Three (sadly, I wouldn&#8217;t be there for that third night&#8211;I was lucky enough just to be in town for work during the first two nights, and I only had tickets for the first!)</p>\n<p>And finally: it was the anniversary of <a href=\"https://wp.me/p9w3Lk-111\">the best show I&#8217;d ever seen</a>, and I&#8217;d been thinking about that show all day&#8211;a pretty daunting bar to measure up to.</p>\n<div class=\"text_exposed_show\">\n<p>Still, like I said, it was Bruce in New Jersey, and I was lucky enough to be in town. Of course I was going to go!</p>\n<p>I had to work a full day in central Jersey, so I opted for a great lower-level ticket just to the left of the stage, and got there well before showtime. It was my first time at MetLife stadium, and I was surprised by how intimate it felt for a stadium&#8211;I&#8217;d expected something more cavernous. This was clearly being treated as a homecoming show, with &#8220;Welcome Home, Bruce!&#8221; banners and signs draped several sections.</p>\n<p>I was by myself and daydreaming (or workdreaming to be more accurate) as the stadium filled, so I completely missed noticing the stands for the string section that had been set up on stage.</p>\n<p>So color me surprised when the show opened with &#8220;New York City Serenade&#8221; complete with strings.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"New York City Serenade (with strings) - Springsteen - MetLife#1 Aug 23, 2016\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jl1BSehj5Ss?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure I laughed out loud when Roy played the opening notes, because I realized that after years of fruitlessly chasing &#8220;New York City Serenade,&#8221; I was about to get it in back-to-back shows, each as the opener, each with strings. I tried to figure out the odds that anyone else was at the Rome show as their last show and then this one as their next one, and I marveled that I&#8217;d been so lucky.</p>\n<p>I couldn&#8217;t possibly know or suspect that I&#8217;d see that song open four of the next five shows I&#8217;d see as well, and I&#8217;d have bet a large sum against you if you&#8217;d suggested it.</p>\n<p>I also didn&#8217;t know that this was the opening salvo in what would turn out to be the third-longest show Bruce ever played in the US (a very short-lived title, as it turned out). But I&#8217;m getting ahead of myself.</p>\n<p>&#8220;New York City Serenade&#8221; was gorgeous&#8211;just as beautiful as in Rome, but a subtly different performance. One of the joys of this leg of the tour would prove to be this ever evolving opener&#8211;each performance had its own character and style (much like its album-mate, &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/01/22/roll-of-the-dice-kittys-back/\">Kitty&#8217;s Back</a>&#8220;), and astute listeners from that leg can listen to any one of them and tell you which show it came from.</p>\n<p>Now it was time to rock: the E Street Band launched into &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/08/12/roll-of-the-dice-wrecking-ball/\">Wrecking Ball,</a>&#8221; a local favorite with added resonance, played on the site of the now-demolished stadium for which it was written.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Wrecking Ball -  Aug 23, 2016 Metlife Stadim 20160823 201920\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lUoF09gMxcg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/05/20/roll-of-the-dice-badlands/\">Badlands</a>&#8221; followed &#8220;Wrecking Ball,&#8221; a one-two punch that established a theme of defiance early on.
