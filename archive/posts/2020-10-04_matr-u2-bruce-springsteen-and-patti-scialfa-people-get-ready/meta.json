At around the six-minute mark, Patti Scialfa joined the boys on stage to bring the song home, but by that point the performance was so loose that they didn&#8217;t quite know how to wrap, so Bruce did the honors himself.</p>\n<div id=\"v-Ds6Exsh4-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='546' src='https://videopress.com/embed/Ds6Exsh4?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p><strong>People Get Ready<br />\nFirst performed:</strong> January 16, 1991 (New York City, NY)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> October 17, 2005 (Philadelphia, PA)</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>Bruce based two of his most uplifting songs on Curtis Mayfield&#8217;s &#8220;People Get Ready,&#8221; but the only time he ever performed the original in an arena was with U2 in 2005.
