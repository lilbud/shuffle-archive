<p>They’re a rock band, a bar band, and at least for a minute they were a polka band.</p>
<p>On the evening of September 27, 2003 at Miller Park in Milwaukee, a fan decided to try to stump the E Street Band (long before that particular game was in fashion) in true Milwaukee style: by requesting “Beer Barrel Polka.”</p>
