<p>On the evening of September 27, 2003 at Miller Park in Milwaukee, a fan decided to try to stump the E Street Band (long before that particular game was in fashion) in true Milwaukee style: by requesting “Beer Barrel Polka.”</p>
<p>Now for most of us, if we know the song at all, we associate it either with the instrumental recordings that date back to the mid-1930s…</p>

<p>…or with “Roll Out the Barrel,” the version with vocals made famous by the Andrews Sisters in 1939.</p>

<p>But to the fine citizens of Milwaukee, “Beer Barrel Polka” is also known as the seventh inning stretch song for the Milwaukee Brewers, and that night the E Street Band was playing in the Brewers’ house.</p>
<p>So how could Bruce refuse?</p>
<p>It really wasn’t up to Bruce, though–he knew that if they were going to pull it off, it was going to be thanks to the virtuoso accordion skills of Danny Federici.</p>
<p>Could Danny pull it off? Of course he could. Watch and see:</p>

<p>That fleeting minute accounts for the only time that Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band have covered “Beer Barrel Polka” in public. I wouldn’t advise holding your breath waiting for another.</p>
