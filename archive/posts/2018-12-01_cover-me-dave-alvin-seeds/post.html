<p>Dave Alvin sure as heck checks off all the boxes with his 1997 cover of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/10/10/roll-of-the-dice-seeds/">Seeds</a>.”</p>
<p>Never issued in studio form, “Seeds” is familiar only to people who heard it live or on Bruce’s <em>Live 1975-85</em> box set, so it was a brave choice for Alvin’s contribution to <em>One Step Up, Two Steps Back</em>, a Springsteen tribute album.</p>
<p>It’s also a song perfectly suited to Alvin’s roots rock sensibilities, and its simple structure gave him a lot of room to take liberties with it. The result is an outstanding road blues arrangement that I daresay is <em>much</em> stronger (and longer) than Bruce’s original version.</p>
<p>One listen and you’re gonna want to get in your car, hit the open road, and crank it up.</p>
