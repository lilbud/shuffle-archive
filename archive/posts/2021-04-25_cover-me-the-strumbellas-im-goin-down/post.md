> “When I was a kid, my dad was a lawyer and sometimes when his clients couldn’t pay him, he would accept different trades in return for legal work. One time, my dad made a deal with a client to get a sports car and it was a really big deal. We never thought we’d have a sports car. My dad would drive us in the sports car down old country roads and blast ‘I’m Goin’ Down’ over and over again. So I have really fond memories of the song.” *— Simon Ward, April 12, 2021*

Canadian alt/indie-country/rock band The Strumbellas may be big Springsteen fans but we only just this month got a chance to see what they could do with Bruce’s material.

Like lots of other bands during this last, lost tour-less year, The Strumbellas have been releasing live performances on video for their fans, including an acoustic series of original songs and covers.

One of those covers was a lovely rendition of Bruce’s “[I’m Goin’ Down](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/06/05/roll-of-the-dice-im-goin-down/),” stripped down to expose the heartbreak hiding in Bruce’s lyrics.

It’s a beautiful performance, highlighted by Isabel Ritchie’s gorgeous violin.
