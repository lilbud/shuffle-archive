Included in the set was a disc of outtakes that had never before seen an official release. While there are some genuine gems among those unreleased outtakes, there are also some headscratchers. (&#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/06/10/roll-of-the-dice-mr-outside/\">Mr. Outside</a>,&#8221; I&#8217;m looking at you.)</p>\n<p>And then there are the songs from the River sessions that <em>still</em> haven&#8217;t seen the light of day but certainly deserve to. Chief among those missing in action: &#8220;Find It Where You Can.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Find It Where You Can&#8221; made it pretty far along, though. It was one of the many songs Bruce recorded at home in early 1979 while he worked them out on acoustic guitar. Take a listen:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen Find It Where You Can\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/c8flVDvDu5c?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>There were a lot of songs that Bruce started at home in early 1979 that never made their way to the E Street Band. But &#8220;Find It Where You Can&#8221; did&#8211;in fact, we have recordings of the E Street Band playing it at a rehearsal session in late March.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen Find it Where You Can #2\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LsmW6Udlrik?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>The lyrics are a bit tough to make out in the band version. Bruce didn&#8217;t bother trying to capture the vocals since these tapes were meant to be guides for the band arrangements rather than demos or candidates for release.</p>\n<p>But luckily we have the early acoustic version below for comparison, and with the lyrics from one and the band performance from the other, we can get a sense of just how strong a track this might have become had the band committed it to record.</p>\n<p>Bruce&#8217;s lyrics seem to be a forerunner to &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/08/08/roll-of-the-dice-tougher-than-the-rest/\">Tougher Than the Rest</a>.&#8221; In the later song, Bruce sings:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Some girls they want a handsome Dan</em><br />\n<em>Or some good-lookin&#8217; Joe, on their arm</em><br />\n<em>Some girls like a sweet-talkin&#8217; Romeo</em><br />\n<em>Well &#8217;round here baby</em><br />\n<em>I learned you get what you can get</em><br />\n<em>So if you&#8217;re rough enough for love</em><br />\n<em>Honey I&#8217;m tougher than the rest</em></p>\n<p>In &#8220;Find It Where You Can,&#8221; Bruce strikes a similar pose:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I didn&#8217;t ask for this conversation</em><br />\n<em>And maybe you don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m nice</em><br />\n<em>Baby it&#8217;s just the&#8230; situation</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;m just another desperate man</em><br />\n<em>In this world you don&#8217;t pick and choose girl</em><br />\n<em>You just find it where you can</em></p>\n<p>Despite the strong rehearsal tapes, there&#8217;s no record of Bruce ever having recorded &#8220;Find It Where You Can&#8221; in the studio. That doesn&#8217;t mean no such version exists, though, so we can always hold out hope.</p>\n<p>More likely than not, though, this is as close as we&#8217;re going to get.</p>\n<p><strong>Find It Where You Can<br />\nRecorded:</strong> March 1979 (rehearsal)<br />\n<strong>Never released</strong><br />\n<strong>Never performed</strong></p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
