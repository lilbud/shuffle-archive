<p>But one could make a fairly compelling argument that he covers it in part every time he sings “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/11/10/roll-of-the-dice-back-in-your-arms/">Back in Your Arms,</a>” because the first twenty seconds of those songs are way too similar to be coincidental.</p>

<p>Aretha released “Without Love” as a single in 1974. It missed the Top 40 in the U.S., but it reached #6 on the U.S. R&amp;B chart. Still, we know it came to Bruce’s attention early on, because Steven Van Zandt arranged it in stunning fashion for Southside Johnny’s 1977 album, <em>This Time It’s For Real.</em></p>

<p>Stevie’s arrangement is bold, brash, lush and orchestral, and Southside’s vocals are at their soulful best. It’s hard to pick a single standout track on such a strong album, but “Without Love” is certainly a contender.</p>
<p>Despite all their many team-ups, Bruce and Southside have yet to perform “Without Love” together, but Bruce at least got to perform it with the Jukes.</p>
<p>In May 1977, Southside took ill during a scheduled homecoming stand at the Count Basie Theater in Red Bank. (It was known at the time as the Monmouth Arts Center.) With Southside unable to perform and with a weeks-old new album in need of a promotional push, Stevie saved the day by fronting the Jukes and enlisting Bruce and the rest of the E Street Band along with Ronnie Spector to form a one-time-only supergroup called The Asbury Park All-Star Revue.</p>
<p>Bruce stayed on backing vocals and guitar for most of the set, including “Without Love,” but he’s present and audible throughout the three performances captured on bootleg from those two nights.</p>
<p>Here’s the first one, from May 12, 1977, the first of Bruce’s only three performances ever of “Without Love.”</p>
