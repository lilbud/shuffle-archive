<p>The Clarks’ version of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/03/04/roll-of-the-dice-the-river/">The River</a>” is both.</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh-based band recorded their uptempo rock arrangement of Bruce’s classic but subdued reckoning of romance-meets-reality back in 2003. Originally released on the <em>Light of Day</em> Springsteen tribute album, The Clarks’ version of “The River” caught fire on local radio, and deservedly so: they managed to successfully translate it from ballad to full-on rocker without losing an ounce of its emotional power, something Bruce hasn’t ever attempted.</p>
<p>It works–better than one might imagine was possible. Take a listen.</p>
