<p>But if you’d asked me which of Bruce’s songs I’d expect her to choose, “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/08/30/roll-of-the-dice-aint-got-you/">Ain’t Got You</a>” would be way down on the list.</p>
<p>But cover it she did, on her 1999 album <em>Doffing, </em>in an a capella fashion that honors the original while showcasing her amazing voice.</p>

<p>It’s a cool, soulful performance of a rarely covered, under-the-radar Springsteen original. The rest of the album is pretty great too, spanning a rock spectrum from soul to folk in Watson’s own style–it’s worth checking out.</p>
