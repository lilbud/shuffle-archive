**1971:** Bruce puts together an ad hoc band (known as Friendly Enemies on the promotional materials but changed to Dr. Zoom and the Sonic Boom by the night of the shows) in order to land a gig opening for the Allman Brothers at Asbury Park's Sunshine In. These two shows feature an on-stage Monopoly game and a baton twirler during the band's set. (Lore has it that all Dr. Zoom shows featured these distractions, but this date is the only documented instance of it.)
