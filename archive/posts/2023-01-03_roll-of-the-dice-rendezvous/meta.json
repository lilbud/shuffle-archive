The song benefited from its 45 live performances before Bruce and the band committed it to tape.</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s particularly intriguing about &#8220;Rendezvous,&#8221; though, is that Bruce continued tweaking it even\u00a0<em>after</em> recording it.</p>\n<p>From its very first outing, &#8220;Rendezvous&#8221; sounds like it was written to be performed live.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - RENDEZVOUS  1976  (audio)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/erYlQgL9v4I?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>With Max Weinberg&#8217;s pounding intro, Danny Federici&#8217;s glockenspiel (for my money, the hallmark of the E Street Band sound even more than Clarence&#8217;s sax), a killer hook, and soaring vocals that you can&#8217;t help but sing along with, &#8220;Rendezvous&#8221; is as perfect a pop song as Bruce has ever written, almost certainly destined for hit single status.</p>\n<p>So of course he couldn&#8217;t release it.</p>\n<p>By the time Bruce was allowed back in the studio, his songwriting had taken a darker turn, and his next album would reflect more mature and somber themes. Trifles like &#8220;Rendezvous&#8221; were relegated to the vault; the E Street studio recording wouldn&#8217;t be released for more than three decades after it was recorded, on Bruce&#8217;s 2010 pop-album-that-might-have been-but-never-was, <em>The Promise</em>.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Rendezvous\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0ena3tWYo-g?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Astute listeners with the patience to listen to dozens of bootlegs know that Bruce tinkered with the lyrics to &#8220;Rendezvous&#8221; over a two-and-a-half-year period before he shelved the song.</p>\n<p>Curiously, though, the studio version features its own unique lyrics&#8211;it seems Bruce worked on &#8220;Rendezvous&#8221; during the touring break in which he recorded it, but when he brought it back on the Darkness Tour, he reverted to the original lyrics. That makes the studio version a lyrical curiosity, and it&#8217;s the weaker for it:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I had a dream our love would last forever</em><br />\n<em>I had a dream last night, she had a dream too</em><br />\n<em>She&#8217;ll be there tonight</em><br />\n<em>If I&#8217;m down then she&#8217;ll make me feel right</em><br />\n<em>Ooh, rendezvous</em></p>\n<p>Bruce&#8217;s studio lyrics inexplicably break the song&#8217;s second-person connection that makes it so powerful in concert. (Pop songs are stronger when sung <em>to </em> the object of one&#8217;s affection rather than <em>about</em> them.)</p>\n<p>Both before and after recording &#8220;Rendezvous&#8221; in the studio, Bruce began the song with:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I had a dream our love would last forever</em><br />\n<em>I had a dream, tonight my dream comes true</em><br />\n<em>And if you&#8217;ll hold me tight</em><br />\n<em>We&#8217;ll be riders, girl, on the night</em><br />\n<em>Ooh, I want a rendezvous</em></p>\n<p>&#8230;a\u00a0<em>much</em> stronger verse.</p>\n<p>Bruce goes third-person in the third verse, too:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Because I had a dream our love would last forever</em><br />\n<em>I had a dream, tonight she had a dream too</em><br />\n<em>So come on hold me tight</em><br />\n<em>We&#8217;ll be riders, girl, on the night</em><br />\n<em>Ooohh, rendezvous</em></p>\n<p>On stage, Bruce sang &#8220;I had a dream, tonight my dream comes true.&#8221; Why Bruce felt compelled to make these changes is a mystery we&#8217;ll likely never have an answer for.</p>\n<p>Those aren&#8217;t the only lyrical tweaks Bruce made. If you listened carefully to the debut performance above, you probably noticed a different bridge as well:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I got a feeling that we&#8217;ll be forever</em><br />\n<em>Because I know that we should be together</em></p>\n<p>Before long, Bruce would re-write it as:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>You deserve so much more than this, girl</em><br />\n<em>Well, I&#8217;m riding on the power and living on the promise in your last kiss</em></p>\n<p>By the end of the Darkness Tour, &#8220;Rendezvous&#8221; had lyrically gelled, but I&#8217;d wager most fans hadn&#8217;t even noticed its evolution. To analyze the lyrics to &#8220;Rendezvous&#8221; is to miss the point of the song&#8211;the only lyrics that really matter are those soaring &#8220;ooohs&#8221; and &#8220;rendezvous&#8221; (which must rank among the top ten most fun words to sing).</p>\n<p>Because it enjoyed so many outings between 1976 and 1978, &#8220;Rendezvous&#8221; was bound to escape into the wild on concert bootlegs, and the song quickly became an enduring fan favorite despite its disappearance for almost two decades following the River Tour.</p>\n<p>When Bruce released his four-disc career compendium of outtakes in 1998, it was a given that &#8220;Rendezvous&#8221; belonged on\u00a0<em>Tracks</em>. However, Bruce chose not to release the studio version, opting instead for its final (at the time, at least) live performance from Uniondale on New Years Eve, 1980.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Rendezvous (Live at Nassau Coliseum, Uniondale, NY - December 1980)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3H72_itMglQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>To my knowledge, Bruce has never commented on why he chose the live version over the studio version, but it was clearly the right choice. I&#8217;d like to think he recognized that the studio version had inferior lyrics, but even if he didn&#8217;t&#8211;the 1980 performance is bright, tight, and just uptempo enough to elevate &#8220;Rendezvous&#8221; to a true rocker.</p>\n<p>Once it was officially released (twice&#8211;it made the cut for\u00a0<em>18 Tracks\u00a0</em>as well), &#8220;Rendezvous&#8221; was one of the first and most frequently performed <em>Tracks\u00a0</em> tracks on the Reunion Tour. Bruce performed &#8220;Rendezvous&#8221; with the E Street Band almost two dozen times in 1999 and 2000, right up to the very last stand of the tour.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Rendezvous - Bruce Springsteen (17-06-2000 Madison Square Garden, New York)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/F3ZjNIB3CdM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>It&#8217;s made cameo appearances in every E Street Band tour since, right up through the very last one.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Rendevouz  - Bruce Springsteen - Sydney Qudos Arena - 9th February 2017\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lGxg5Atl1Mk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>I don&#8217;t expect Bruce to break that streak. As oxymoronic as it sounds, &#8220;Rendezvous&#8221; is a dependable rarity bound to appear once more when the E Street Band takes to the road again.</p>\n<p><strong>Bonus #1:\u00a0</strong>Long before Bruce released his studio version of &#8220;Rendezvous,&#8221; a studio outtake recorded a few months earlier managed to escape as a bootleg. That outtake was one of the very first songs recorded during the\u00a0<em>Darkness on the Edge of Town</em> sessions (it may, in fact, hail from the very first day), and you can hear it below. Despite some early audio dropouts, it&#8217;s a great recording in a much more guitar-driven arrangement than we&#8217;re used to hearing.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Rendezvous (Studio Version)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sQKhsmH98E4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><strong>Bonus #2:\u00a0</strong>Bruce knew &#8220;Rendezvous&#8221; wasn&#8217;t going to find a home on one of his albums, but he seemed determined to find some adoptive parents for it. Bruce first donated the song to Greg Kihn, who released <a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/07/17/cover-me-greg-kihn-band-rendezvous/\">his cover</a> in 1979, followed by Gary U.S. Bonds, who covered it on his\u00a0<em>On the Line</em> album in 1982.</p>\n<p>But he also tried giving &#8220;Rendezvous&#8221; to The Knack in 1978, offering the band a choice between that song and &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/05/03/roll-of-the-dice-dont-look-back/\">Don&#8217;t Look Back</a>.&#8221; They chose the latter, so we never got to hear what The Knack might have done with &#8220;Rendezvous.&#8221; However: someone actually recorded Bruce <em>teaching</em> The Knack how to play &#8220;Rendezvous&#8221; before the band ultimately decided to pass on it, and that recording escaped as well. It&#8217;s a fun listen and a glimpse at what an acoustic arrangement of &#8220;Rendezvous&#8221; might have sounded like.</p>\n<div id=\"v-d4wU6cXH-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='568' src='https://videopress.com/embed/d4wU6cXH?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p><strong>Rendezvous<br />\nRecorded:</strong> September 29, 1977<br />\n<strong>Released:\u00a0</strong><em>The Promise\u00a0</em>(2010)<br />\n<strong>First performed:</strong> August 1, 1976 (Red Bank, NJ)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> November 16, 2019 (Asbury Park, NJ)</p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
