When I started this blog, the very first cover I wanted to share was Sharon Van Etten’s version of “[Drive All Night](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/02/27/roll-of-the-dice-drive-all-night/).” It’s gorgeous–and Sharon’s vocals are so passionate that I dare say they rival the original. Without a doubt, it’s one of my all-time favorite covers of a Springsteen song.

But unfortunately, all of the videos of her performance of it had been removed–except for one. It’s a beautiful live performance (at The Stone Pony, no less), but the audio inexplicably cut out toward the end of the song. So I didn’t share it, but every few weeks I’d check to see if another, corrected video had surfaced. To date, no such luck.

**Update 8/25/19:** Found it–and it’s complete, too! Here’s that gorgeous performance at the Stone Pony in May 2014. Watch and marvel:

Luckily, in my search for that video, I stumbled across a complete audio version–and it’s orchestrally enhanced by Soundcloud user TomBerry26.

I have no idea who TomBerry26 is, but he has my thanks. His version enhanced version is beautiful in its own right.
