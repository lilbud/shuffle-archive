I went to a music publisher which a friend of mine was running. He said \u2018I\u2019ve got this guy from America who\u2019s just sent me quite a few of his songs. I think he\u2019s gonna be quite big.\u2019 I said \u2018Let\u2019s hear it\u2019.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&#8220;So we sat down and he put the tape on and two hours later after listening to some brilliant, brilliant music I said \u2018Wow, is there any chance of having any of these songs?\u2019 He said \u2018Well, there\u2019s nothing planned in terms of bringing anything out but I suppose it would be ok.\u2019</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&#8220;So I chose three songs that I liked which were \u2018Born To Run\u2019, \u2018<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/04/26/roll-of-the-dice-4th-of-july-asbury-park-sandy/\">Sandy</a>\u2019, and a very unknown song called \u2018If I Were The Priest\u2019 which I don\u2019t think that he ever put on an album.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>Clarke had good taste: at the time he selected them, &#8220;Born to Run&#8221; hadn&#8217;t yet been released, and Clarke&#8217;s recording of &#8220;If I Were the Priest&#8221; (Clarke changed the title&#8217;s mood to the proper subjunctive) would have the field to itself for 46 years until its songwriter finally came around and released his own version.</p>\n<p>Clarke released &#8220;If I Were the Priest&#8221; on his 1974 eponymous solo album. Initially unavailable in the U.S., enterprising Springsteen fans managed to track down copies once <em>Born to Run</em> catapulted Bruce to stardom and word got out that an unreleased Springsteen-penned song was floating around in the form of a cover.</p>\n<p>Philadelphia DJ Ed Sciaky was one of those fans. Sciaky got his hands on a copy and surprised Bruce with it during an in-studio radio interview on November 3, 1974&#8211;much to 25-year-old Bruce&#8217;s audible annoyance.</p>\n<!--[if lt IE 9]><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\">document.createElement('audio');</script><![endif]-->\n<audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-24345-1\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Ed-Sciaky-Bruce-Springsteen-interview-from-1974-11-031.mp3?_=1\" /><a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Ed-Sciaky-Bruce-Springsteen-interview-from-1974-11-031.mp3\">https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Ed-Sciaky-Bruce-Springsteen-interview-from-1974-11-031.mp3</a></audio>\n<p>Sciaky played the cover in full for Bruce and the band; we can only imagine the reactions taking place in the studio for those four minutes.</p>\n<p>The thing is, though: it&#8217;s a\u00a0<em>great</em> cover.
