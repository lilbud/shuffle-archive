title: Raise Your Hand

“I met Bruce in Memphis and he wanted me to come to his show, and I did go, and I went on stage, but I sung both of the songs, and he didn’t really sing them with me. But after, I saw his version [of “Raise Your Hand”] is to mine as far as performance… I see Bruce’s version of it doing it the very same way, dropping down on his knees and all the way up. Back in Memphis, I didn’t know he did all that.” — *so close**Eddie Floyd, American Songwriter Spotlight on Songwriters, Episode 148 (2020)*



“Mr. Eddie Floyd! The great Eddie Floyd! That’s the man that wrote the book! Oh yeah, goddamn, that’s the man that wrote the book!” *— Bruce Springsteen, Memphis, Tennessee, April 29, 1976*

How much of an influence was Eddie Floyd on Bruce Springsteen?

You tell me. First, watch Eddie’s incredible 1967 performance of “Raise Your Hand” and marvel at how he absolutely owns the initially reserved Norwegian crowd by the end of those seven minutes.

Side note: if you haven’t seen that clip before, and if you’re a fan of the Stax sound, you owe it to yourself to seek out the concert film. You’ll thank me later.

Now, watch Bruce cover Floyd’s song eleven years later in Passaic, New Jersey.

Those are some remarkably recognizable techniques on display, aren’t they?

Even Bruce’s casual fans recognize Floyd’s importance as a musical influence–we’ve seen it evidenced in Bruce’s set lists over the years, from Floyd-penned staples like “” on the Wrecking Ball Tour to memorable cameos like “” and “.”

But it’s “Raise Your Hand” that’s been the stalwart, appearing in Bruce’s set lists almost 200 times (and that’s counting the partial or instrumental performances during sign collections).

“Raise Your Hand” wasn’t Floyd’s biggest hit; that honor goes to “Knock on Wood.” It wasn’t even his second or third greatest single. In fact, “Raise Your Hand” only reached #16 on the R&B chart and #79 on the Hot 100. Listening to the original recording with hindsight, that’s not surprising–to listeners more familiar with Bruce’s version, Floyd’s studio performance plods by comparison.

But oh, how the song came alive when Eddie performed it in concert. And how could it not? It’s got audience participation wired in throughout, starting with its title.

Bruce must have seen Eddie perform it live at some point, because the influence of Eddie’s live arrangements is unmistakable from Bruce’s earliest performances. Here’s the E Street Band’s first-ever public performance of “Raise Your Hand,” live in Durham, North Carolina on March 28, 1976.

“Raise Your Hand” has been a steady presence in Bruce’s live shows ever since, appearing in almost every E Street Band tour since its debut. (The Born in the U.S.A. and recent River tours are notable exceptions.)

Originally an encore or show-closer, in recent years Bruce has used “Raise Your Hand” as background music when he collects sign requests. (Get it?) These days, “Raise Your Hand” is prone to pop up pretty much anywhere in the set, as with its mid-set appearance during its last outing in 2014.

And while it’s now been more than seven years since Bruce last uttered those immortal words, “If there’s something you … if there’s something you ….” you can bet we’ll be raising our hands again someday soon.

Here’s that performance Eddie alluded to in that interview, from Eddie and Bruce’s only on-stage meeting–the night of April 29, 1976. Eddie sings lead vocals on his own; Bruce relegates himself to the background. But keep in mind as you listen: Eddie had never seen Bruce perform his song before. Bruce leads the E Street Band through their standard arrangement, so close to Eddie’s own live arrangement that Eddie wears it like a comfortable shoe.
