<p>Today marks the end of Year Four of this site’s daily mission to document every song Bruce Springsteen has ever written, recorded, or performed in concert.</p>
<p>It also marks:</p>
<ul>
<li>2,949 blog posts over 1,461 consecutive days of daily publishing</li>
<li>The completion of my annual refresh project–every <em>Roll of the Dice</em>, <em>Cover Me</em>, <em>Meeting Across the River, Where the Band Was, and Two Faces</em> entry is now refreshed with repaired media links and new cross-site links.</li>
<li>The end of the <em>Kingdom of Days</em> series (but don’t worry–it restarts tomorrow!)</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether you’ve been with me from the beginning or just discovered this site for the first time today, I’d like to take a moment to thank you for reading, subscribing, commenting, liking and/or sharing.</p>

<p>I’m continually amazed and humbled that so many people stop by each day. It took more than three years to reach a million article views; this year we’ll not only pass the two million but possibly the three-million mark as well!</p>

<p>And that doesn’t even account for those of you who subscribe and are reading this in your inbox right now instead of your browser–you account for over 1.25 million e-mails this past year alone!</p>
<p>As always, special thanks to those of you who have written to me with corrections, additional information, absolutely amazing “I was there” stories (especially my “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/category/where-the-band-was/">Where the Band Was</a>” guest bloggers who gave me welcome writing reprieves from time to time–please drop me a line if you’d like to share your story), personal anecdotes, and alternative interpretations. That’s been my absolute favorite part of these four years, and as a result I feel like I’ve learned at least as much as I’ve shared.</p>
<p>Extra special thanks to recurring guest-blogger Katy Crane, who kicked off a new <em>Two Faces</em> series recently and immediately notched two of the site’s ten most popular posts of the year. I’m hopeful that we’ll continue to enjoy her writing whenever her busy schedule allows.</p>
<p>And my profound thanks to Lori Pierce, who appears in my inbox within minutes of a typo showing up in one of my essays (in other words, pretty much every day). She’s my pro bono, ex post facto copy editor, and I am deeply grateful for her eagle eye and writer’s voice.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, today marks the end of the year-long <a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/category/kingdom-of-days/">Kingdom of Days</a> series–but if you enjoy those, fear not: the series restarts tomorrow, with new events from 2021, repaired and fresh media, and new information turned up during my research this past year.</p>
<p>In addition, I’ll continue to spotlight an <a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/roll-of-the-dice-album-by-album/">original Springsteen song</a>, <a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/category/cover-me/">cover</a>, or <a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/category/meeting-across-the-river/">team-up</a> each day, health and work schedule permitting.</p>
<p>According to my tracking spreadsheet, I still have about 300 articles left to write before I bring this project to a close, so we’ve still got a long way to travel together. I hope you stick with me for the rest of the ride.</p>
<p>Thanks again for reading. Onward to Year Five!</p>
