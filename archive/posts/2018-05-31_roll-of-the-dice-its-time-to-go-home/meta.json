When the music stops, the communal connection is broken, and the introverted artist who just entertained thousands is now isolated and withdrawn from the crowd he so recently commanded:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Empty tin cans cover the ground</em><br />\n<em>Empty love bands bled the last chords down</em><br />\n<em>Stoned out people running wild</em><br />\n<em>Someone announces they lost that night</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Then you know, then you know</em><br />\n<em>Oh, how you know</em><br />\n<em>When you&#8217;re standing in the middle of a crowd and you feel so alone</em><br />\n<em>The party&#8217;s over, it&#8217;s time to go home</em></p>\n<p>Is Bruce singing from his imagination, or is this how he truly experiences coming down from his on-stage high? We don&#8217;t know, but <a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/01/09/roll-of-the-dice-hollywood-kids/\">this would not be the last time Bruce would visit this theme</a>.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s also a particularly revealing bridge that Bruce sings with such power and feeling that it&#8217;s easy to believe it&#8217;s personal:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Sometimes I think I was born too late</em><br />\n<em>To be what I wanna be</em><br />\n<em>Because when I look around me I can&#8217;t relate</em><br />\n<em>There&#8217;s no room, there&#8217;s no place for me</em></p>\n<p>Bruce has said on more than one occasion that when he started out as an artist, he feared that he was already too late&#8211;that rock and roll had already reached its peak and there was nothing new that he could add to it. So this verse resonates with personal truth.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s no resolution, here, just observation. The song ends with the narrator spotting a girl crying silently behind a tree, experiencing a different kind of withdrawal, and reaching the same conclusion: like it or not, it&#8217;s time to go home.</p>\n<p><strong>It&#8217;s Time to Go Home</strong><br />\n<strong>Recorded</strong>: N/A<br />\n<strong>Released</strong>: N/A<br />\n<strong>First performed:</strong> September 1, 1971 (Long Branch, NJ)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> September 1, 1971 (Long Branch, NJ)</p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
