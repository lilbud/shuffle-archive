**1986:** Finally–after years of pent-up demand for a live album and the development of a healthy bootleg black market, Bruce releases his first live album, and it’s a doozy: a five-LP/3-CD compilation called *Live 1975-85*. It’s been a year since the end of the Born in the U.S.A. Tour, but Bruce-mania is still at a fever pitch. The new box set is tremendously hyped, initial demand is high, and the news coverage is intense.
