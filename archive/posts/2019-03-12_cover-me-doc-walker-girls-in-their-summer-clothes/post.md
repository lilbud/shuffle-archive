Sure, we know that Bruce’s songs translate well into country music arrangements. A good deal of his catalog is country-inspired, so it only makes sense that his music should appeal to country artists.

Check out [The Mavericks’ wonderful rendition of “All That Heaven Will Allow”](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/02/28/cover-me-the-mavericks-all-that-heaven-will-allow/) for example, or Thompson Square on “[Brilliant Disguise](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/10/17/cover-me-thompson-square-brilliant-disguise/).”

But if you ranked all of Bruce’s songs on a “Most Likely to be Covered by a Country Artist” list, my guess is “[Girls in Their Summer Clothes](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/02/17/roll-of-the-dice-girls-in-their-summer-clothes/)” wouldn’t be anywhere near the top of it.

And yet… Canadian country band Doc Walker took a swing at it on their 2009 album *Go*, and dang if it doesn’t work perfectly. Hear for yourself:

Can’t say I prefer it to Bruce’s original, but it’s a very nice cover nonetheless.
