<p>Check out <a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/02/28/cover-me-the-mavericks-all-that-heaven-will-allow/">The Mavericks’ wonderful rendition of “All That Heaven Will Allow”</a> for example, or Thompson Square on “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/10/17/cover-me-thompson-square-brilliant-disguise/">Brilliant Disguise</a>.”</p>
<p>But if you ranked all of Bruce’s songs on a “Most Likely to be Covered by a Country Artist” list, my guess is “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/02/17/roll-of-the-dice-girls-in-their-summer-clothes/">Girls in Their Summer Clothes</a>” wouldn’t be anywhere near the top of it.</p>
<p>And yet… Canadian country band Doc Walker took a swing at it on their 2009 album <em>Go</em>, and dang if it doesn’t work perfectly. Hear for yourself:</p>

<p>Can’t say I prefer it to Bruce’s original, but it’s a very nice cover nonetheless.</p>
