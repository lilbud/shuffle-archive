<p>Australian singer-songwriter Amy Shark made an appearance in Los Angeles-based KIIS-FM’s Living Room Concert Series last month, playing a set of her standards and debuting a new song.</p>
<p>To close her set, though, Amy chose a cover–her all-time favorite Springsteen song, “<a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/05/30/roll-of-the-dice-secret-garden/">Secret Garden</a>.”</p>
<p>Amy’s arrangement was a bit more percussive than Bruce’s wistful original, with a beautiful trumpet solo to close the song. With her heartfelt vocals soaring above, the full effect is an absolutely gorgeous cover.</p>
<p>Take a listen and enjoy.</p>
