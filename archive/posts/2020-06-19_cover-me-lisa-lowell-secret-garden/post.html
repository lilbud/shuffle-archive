<p>You’re familiar with Lisa Lowell’s voice, even if you don’t know her name.</p>
<p>You can hear her backing vocals all over Bruce’s <a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2023/03/28/album-companion-wrecking-ball/"><em>Wrecking Ball</em> </a>album, as far back as “<a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/03/17/roll-of-the-dice-better-days/">Better Days</a>,” and even on recently released tracks like “<a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/08/09/roll-of-the-dice-ill-stand-by-you-always/">I’ll Stand By You</a>.” And of course, she was an on-stage presence throughout the Seeger Session Tour.</p>
<p>We actually heard a bit of Lisa’s work yesterday in Patti Scialfa’s “<a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/?p=19060">Rainy Day Man</a>.” We rarely get a chance to hear her lead vocals, though. That’s too bad, because she’s a wonderful singer.</p>
<p>So today, let’s take a listen to Lisa performing Bruce’s “<a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/05/30/roll-of-the-dice-secret-garden/">Secret Garden</a>” live on E Street Radio way back in 2011. She gives it a terrific and nuanced reading.</p>

<p>(By the way, there’s another familiar talent on display in that performance, although you can’t actually see him: that’s Larry Eagle of the Sessions Band on percussion.)</p>
<p>For more Lisa Lowell, check out her solo album, <em>Beautiful Behavior</em>. We took a look at one of the album’s standout tracks (“<a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/12/12/matr-lisa-lowell-and-bruce-springsteen-the-moulin-rouge/">The Moulin Rouge</a>“) a year and a half ago, because Bruce plays guitar on it, but the whole album is great.</p>
