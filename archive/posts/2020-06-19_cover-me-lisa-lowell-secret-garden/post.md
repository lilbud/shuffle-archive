You're familiar with Lisa Lowell's voice, even if you don't know her name.

You can hear her backing vocals all over Bruce's [*Wrecking Ball*](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2023/03/28/album-companion-wrecking-ball/)album, as far back as "[Better Days](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/03/17/roll-of-the-dice-better-days/)," and even on recently released tracks like "[I'll Stand By You](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/08/09/roll-of-the-dice-ill-stand-by-you-always/)." And of course, she was an on-stage presence throughout the Seeger Session Tour.

We actually heard a bit of Lisa's work yesterday in Patti Scialfa's "[Rainy Day Man](https://estreetshuffle.com/?p=19060)." We rarely get a chance to hear her lead vocals, though. That's too bad, because she's a wonderful singer.

So today, let's take a listen to Lisa performing Bruce's "[Secret Garden](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/05/30/roll-of-the-dice-secret-garden/)" live on E Street Radio way back in 2011. She gives it a terrific and nuanced reading.

(By the way, there's another familiar talent on display in that performance, although you can't actually see him: that's Larry Eagle of the Sessions Band on percussion.)

For more Lisa Lowell, check out her solo album, *Beautiful Behavior*. We took a look at one of the album's standout tracks ("[The Moulin Rouge](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/12/12/matr-lisa-lowell-and-bruce-springsteen-the-moulin-rouge/)") a year and a half ago, because Bruce plays guitar on it, but the whole album is great.
