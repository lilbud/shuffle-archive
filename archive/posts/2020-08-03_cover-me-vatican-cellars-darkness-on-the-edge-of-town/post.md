If I had less restraint, I’d probably feature a cover from the outstanding compilation (released back in 2009) at least once a week. There are so many great tracks on that album–I really can’t recommend it enough.

*Play Some Pool, Skip Some School, Act Real Cool*

(See my previous entry on Jeniferever’s of “” from that compilation.)

Today, the spotlight is on one of my favorites: a gorgeous cello and double bass-led arrangement of “” by Vatican Cellars.

[Darkness on the Edge of Town](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/04/10/roll-of-the-dice-darkness-on-the-edge-of-town/)

Vatican Cellars is a five-piece “folk noir” band from the UK, and that’s a pretty apt description.

Their subject matter is dark, and their vocals are somber. But oh, those strings… I just lose myself in that bridge every time.

Take a listen and enjoy (and then trust me and get the compilation!)
