We hadn&#8217;t yet hit the former by the time of this Oakland show (although it would shortly thereafter), but this show sure satisfied the latter.</p>\n<p>The day of the show was one of the most inhospitable ones I can remember&#8211;just torrents of rain all day long.\u00a0 My friend Steve and I flew down for the show, and we were very glad we&#8217;d decided not to do GA for this show. (We got our tickets through Steve Van Zandt&#8217;s Rock and Roll Foundation and opted for great seats instead.) Even so, we had a hard time finding ways to stay dry in downtown Oakland, and as you can probably tell from the photo below, we were pretty well waterlogged by showtime.</p>\n<p>The Foundation tickets came with an awesome pre-show highlight, though&#8211;one that I&#8217;ll probably remember longer than the show itself: we got to meet Steve himself and take a quick photo with him!</p>\n<p><img
