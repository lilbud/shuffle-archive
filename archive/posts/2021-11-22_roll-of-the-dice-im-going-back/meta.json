Almost never do we hear anything from the nineties forward, and especially not with the E Street Band.</p>\n<p>So that&#8217;s what makes today&#8217;s entry special. &#8220;I&#8217;m Going Back&#8221; (which almost certainly is not the title Bruce had in mind, if he ever even got that far) dates back to the January 1995 Greatest Hits sessions that yielded &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/11/10/roll-of-the-dice-back-in-your-arms/\">Back in Your Arms</a>,&#8221; &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/12/06/roll-of-the-dice-blood-brothers/\">Blood Brothers</a>,&#8221; and &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/05/30/roll-of-the-dice-secret-garden/\">Secret Garden</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Almost every song from those sessions has been released in some fashion or other, but &#8220;I&#8217;m Going Back&#8221; is an exception.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"&quot;I&#039;m Goin Back&quot; - Bruce Springsteen 1995 Work in Progress Song - Unreleased\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/26_jOBM25J0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>The take of &#8220;I&#8217;m Going Back&#8221; that circulates among collectors is an early one. There are almost no lyrics to speak of (except for the phrase fans have seized on for the title), but it&#8217;s a thrill to hear the newly and temporarily reunited E Street Band working out a new song.</p>\n<p>Bruce bluffs his way through the track entirely in falsetto, while the band builds in power and momentum until they finally explode around the two-minute mark.</p>\n<p>What might this song have become if Bruce had taken the time to finish it? We may never know, unless a later take exists in his vault somewhere. But this early version gives us some insight into Bruce rediscovering and testing his &#8220;rock voice&#8221; with his old bandmates.</p>\n<p>It turned out to be too soon to stick&#8211;he had one more solo album to focus on first&#8211;but it was a harbinger of a new E Street Band era to come.</p>\n<p><strong>I&#8217;m Going Back<br />\nRecorded:</strong> January 1995<br />\n<strong>Never released</strong><br />\n<strong>Never performed</strong></p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
