On June 29 1985, U2 played a homecoming show at Croke Park in Dublin. Bono kicked off the encores with a dedication to his father: a cover of “[My Hometown](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/04/09/roll-of-the-dice-my-hometown/).”

I’ll give Bono credit for the heartfelt vocals, but I don’t think it’s possible to arrange the song in a way that screams “1980s!” more than this one…
