**1975:** Bruce's legendary stand at the Bottom Line in New York City begins here, on Night One of a five-night/ten-show residency, during which 25% of all tickets are distributed by Columbia Records to journalists and employees, establishing high stakes for Bruce and the E Street Band throughout the stand. The early show is mostly undocumented but known to feature Bruce's first performance of "[When You Walk in the Room](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/10/08/cover-me-when-you-walk-in-the-room/)" and only the second-ever performance of "[Backstreets](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/05/14/roll-of-the-dice-backstreets/)." The late show features the first ever performance of "[Night](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/10/31/roll-of-the-dice-night/)" and the last recorded "New York City Serenade" until the Reunion Tour almost a quarter-century later.
