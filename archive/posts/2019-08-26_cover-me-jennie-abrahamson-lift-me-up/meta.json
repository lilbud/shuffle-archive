Sung in a falsetto, Bruce&#8217;s voice is almost unrecognizable to the uninitiated, but it spoke to Swedish singer/songwriter Jennie Abrahamson nonetheless. Here&#8217;s how she describes it:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>A beautiful love song about dependence, about letting oneself be lifted by love. That&#8217;s how I interpret it&#8230; I first heard it when I was on the mat in a yoga class. I remember being still for quite a long while in a quite complex position, but despite the heavy body work my mind just drifted away to this song and I found tears running down my face. It had such an immediate beauty to it, it spoke right to my heart.</em></p>\n<p>Jennie was so taken with the song that she tinkered with it in the studio and created a modern arrangement that preserves and honors Bruce&#8217;s haunting, ethereal original. The result was so powerful that Abrahamson chose to close her latest album with it.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s that track, from her 2017 album <em>Reverseries.</em></p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Lift Me Up\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/c7IeVzvZn28?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Bonus: Here&#8217;s Jennie performing Lift Me Up&#8221; in concert at WOMAD last summer.
