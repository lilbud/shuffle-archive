I guess i’m in a bit of a mood this week, as this the second cover I’ve posted recently from that album.

*Nebraska*

But Aoife O’Donovan’s cover of the is too good to sit on, so I won’t.

But more importantly: how is that I’ve never heard of before? I’m an instant fan, and it’s gonna take me a long time to browse all their gorgeously filmed performances from some very talented artists. Highly recommended.
