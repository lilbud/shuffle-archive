<p>Today’s roll of the dice is undeservedly obscure.</p>
<p>Sandwiched in between Bruce’s guitar-heavy Steel Mill jams and his early Columbia character-driven stories is this funky, horn-fueled dance number.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMv8WkenPyg">Watch on Youtube: The Bruce Springsteen Band - "Dance Dance Dance"</a></p>
<p>There’s no lyrical depth here, nor should there be, so it doesn’t require or ask for lyrical analysis. If this song is about anything, it’s about losing yourself in music:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Everybody’s grooving on the floor now</em><br/>
<em>Feet’s moving, think they’re gonna dance</em><br/>
<em>The band is playing as you walk in that door now</em><br/>
<em>Come on now, won’t you take that chance</em><br/>
<em>I said come on now, won’t you mama</em><br/>
<em>Come on, won’t you take that chance</em><br/>
<em>There ain’t nothing here that’s gonna hound you</em><br/>
<em>There ain’t nothing to it, let your body go</em><br/>
<em>(Dance, dance, dance)</em><br/>
<em>(Dance, dance, dance)</em></p>
<p>…so go ahead, give it a listen, and lose yourself.</p>
<p>Bruce performed “Dance, Dance, Dance” with The Bruce Springsteen Band a small handful of times in the summer of 1971, but no studio recordings are known to exist.</p>
