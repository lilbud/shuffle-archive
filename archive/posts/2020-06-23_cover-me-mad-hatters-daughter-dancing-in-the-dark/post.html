<p>“<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/12/25/roll-of-the-dice-dancing-in-the-dark/">Dancing in the Dark</a>” has been enjoying a bit of a renaissance these past couple of years.</p>
<p>Once largely dismissed as a very eighties pop hit (which in fairness, it was), it seems that artists from all sorts of places and genres have lately dialed into the cry of loneliness and need for connection that lurks at the heart of Bruce’s greatest hit.</p>
<p>The results are usually mixed, because the original is so deeply embedded in pop culture that it’s hard to stray far from it.</p>
<p>Enter Mad Hatter’s Daughter. The Hamburg duo have been performing since 2016, and Kira Isles’ smoky, emotive vocals prove perfect for their lonely, contemplative arrangement. Theirs is one of the few versions of “Dancing in the Dark” where you can really <em>feel</em> the song.</p>
