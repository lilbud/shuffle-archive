(Check out their archive <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-2JUs_G21BrJ0efehwGkUw">here</a>, but be forewarned: you can easily get lost for hours down that hole)</p>
<p>Now the folks behind Scary Pockets are back with a new series, simply called Stories.</p>
<p>Like Scary Pockets, Stories features a rotating cast of musicians and vocalists, but instead of funking it up, the Stories cover series features stripped-down (but no less inventive) arrangements that let the songwriter’s story shine through.</p>
<p>Their latest release features Grammy-nominated singer-songwriter Garrison Starr at the microphone, fronting a beautiful acoustic rendition of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/09/21/roll-of-the-dice-born-in-the-u-s-a/">Born in the U.S.A</a>.” that accentuates the pathos of the song rather than the anger or bitterness we’re more familiar with.</p>
<p>It’s a painstakingly textured and nuanced arrangement, gently but deeply sad. Play this for someone who’s never paid much attention to the lyrics, and I guarantee they will this time.</p>

<p>Once again, I’m an instant fan; once again, I’m about to lose way too much time exploring their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-yUK_2HT9rxQSsweAjjNiA/featured">wonderful library</a>.</p>
<p>Keep ’em coming, guys.</p>
