**1973:** Bruce plays his first-ever show in Maine, co-headlining with Orleans at Ricker College in Houlton.

**1974:** Bruce, Garry, Max, and Roy stop by WMMR-FM in Philadelphia before heading out on the road for a week of shows in Texas. Ed Sciaky records a fascinating interview with Bruce, well worth listening to. During the interview, "Born to Run" receives its radio debut when Sciaky decides to play Bruce's demo so that Bruce can hear what it sounds like on the radio. The recording below may be a bit confusing to follow at times, as it's Sciaky in 1979 doing a retrospective on his interview from this date in 1974, but it's a great document of the original conversation. Take a listen.

**1975:** Bruce and the E Street Band play their first of three nights at Arizona State University in Tempe.
