<p>It takes guts to reinvent an anthem like “<a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/05/20/roll-of-the-dice-badlands/">Badlands</a>.” Even Bruce has never deviated from its original arrangement–it was pretty much born perfect.</p>
<p>But leave it to fellow Jersey boy Joe D’Urso to take a swing at it, and he certainly puts his own spin on it, giving it almost an island-flavored arrangement with a boost from Miami Horns members Richie LaBamba, Mark Pender, and Jerry Vivino.</p>
