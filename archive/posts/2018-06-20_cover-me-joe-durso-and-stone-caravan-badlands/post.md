It takes guts to reinvent an anthem like “[Badlands](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/05/20/roll-of-the-dice-badlands/).” Even Bruce has never deviated from its original arrangement–it was pretty much born perfect.

But leave it to fellow Jersey boy Joe D’Urso to take a swing at it, and he certainly puts his own spin on it, giving it almost an island-flavored arrangement with a boost from Miami Horns members Richie LaBamba, Mark Pender, and Jerry Vivino.
