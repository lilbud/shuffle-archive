Today’s Bruce cover is close to home: From the tail end of the E Street Diaspora comes this gorgeous Nils Lofgren cover of “[Wreck on the Highway](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/08/28/roll-of-the-dice-wreck-on-the-highway/).”

Originally recorded for a Bruce tribute album in 1997, it was re-released on Nils’ *Face the Music* box set a few years back.

Nils’ vocals suit the song, but for my money the highlight is Nils’ take one the long guitar outro. This is easily a repeat-listen cover.
