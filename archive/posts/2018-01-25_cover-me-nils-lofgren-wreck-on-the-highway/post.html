<p>Today’s Bruce cover is close to home: From the tail end of the E Street Diaspora comes this gorgeous Nils Lofgren cover of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/08/28/roll-of-the-dice-wreck-on-the-highway/">Wreck on the Highway</a>.”</p>
<p>Originally recorded for a Bruce tribute album in 1997, it was re-released on Nils’ <em>Face the Music</em> box set a few years back.</p>
<p>Nils’ vocals suit the song, but for my money the highlight is Nils’ take one the long guitar outro. This is easily a repeat-listen cover.</p>
