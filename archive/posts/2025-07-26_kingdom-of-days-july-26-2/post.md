**2002:** Bruce and the E Street Band play an afternoon Rising Tour rehearsal show at Asbury Park’s Convention Hall before an audience of contest winners. Bruce plays “[Countin’ on a Miracle](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/02/05/roll-of-the-dice-countin-on-a-miracle/)” for the first time, and “Into the Fire” features Clarence on bagpipes (that arrangement will not make it to the tour itself). “[Glory Days](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2024/06/04/roll-of-the-dice-glory-days/)” also makes its return, which surprisingly was not played at all during the Reunion Tour. That evening, Bruce surprises the concert winners when he shows up at Sonny’s Southern Cuisine and takes requests.
