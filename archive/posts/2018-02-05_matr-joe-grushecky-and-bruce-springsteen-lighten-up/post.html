<p>Today’s meeting across the river comes from the city of three rivers: Pittsburgh, PA.</p>
<p>For a brief time in 1995, Bruce Springsteen joined Joe Grushecky and the Houserockers, taking a supporting role during Joe’s <a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/10/17/american-babylon-a-retrospective/"><em>American Babylon </em></a>tour. (Bruce produced the album, played and sang on several tracks, and wrote two of them.)</p>
<p>This audio clip is the final encore from the October 20, 1995 show at Nick’s Fat City, “Lighten Up” from Joe’s album, <em>End of the Century</em>. Bruce is on background vocals and guitar, but you can hear him clearly. The song starts about a minute in.</p>
