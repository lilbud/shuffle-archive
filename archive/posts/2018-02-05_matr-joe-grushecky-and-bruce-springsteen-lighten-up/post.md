Today’s meeting across the river comes from the city of three rivers: Pittsburgh, PA.

For a brief time in 1995, Bruce Springsteen joined Joe Grushecky and the Houserockers, taking a supporting role during Joe’s [*American Babylon*](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/10/17/american-babylon-a-retrospective/)tour. (Bruce produced the album, played and sang on several tracks, and wrote two of them.)

This audio clip is the final encore from the October 20, 1995 show at Nick’s Fat City, “Lighten Up” from Joe’s album, *End of the Century*. Bruce is on background vocals and guitar, but you can hear him clearly. The song starts about a minute in.
