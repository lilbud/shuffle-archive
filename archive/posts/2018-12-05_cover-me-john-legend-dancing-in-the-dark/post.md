John Legend has covered Bruce’s greatest hit many times in concert, including at Bruce’s MusiCares Person of the Year Tribute concert.

But my favorite performance was during “Springsteen Week” in 2012 on the *The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon*. Legend made an appearance to play “[Dancing in the Dark](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/12/25/roll-of-the-dice-dancing-in-the-dark/)” with The Roots, and their team-up was atmospheric, jazzy and magical.
