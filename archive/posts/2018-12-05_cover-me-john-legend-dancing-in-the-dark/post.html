<p>John Legend has covered Bruce’s greatest hit many times in concert, including at Bruce’s MusiCares Person of the Year Tribute concert.</p>
<p>But my favorite performance was during “Springsteen Week” in 2012 on the <em>The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon</em>. Legend made an appearance to play “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/12/25/roll-of-the-dice-dancing-in-the-dark/">Dancing in the Dark</a>” with The Roots, and their team-up was atmospheric, jazzy and magical.</p>
