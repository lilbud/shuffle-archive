Dropkick Murphys co-wrote “I’m Shipping Up to Boston” with Woody Guthrie. Seriously.

Chancing upon the hand-written lyrics on a scrap of paper in Guthrie’s archives, Ken Casey and crew set them to music in 2006 and scored their biggest hit in the process.

On St. Patrick’s Day in 2011, Bruce shipped up to Boston to perform it with the original artists–his one and only performance of the song to date. It was a fantastic performance, captured in great quality. Check it out below.
