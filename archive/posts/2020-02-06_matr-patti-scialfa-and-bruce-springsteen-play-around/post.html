<p>Toward the end of Patti Scialfa’s third album, <em>Play It as It Lays</em>, there’s a quiet but confident song called “Play Around.” It’s not one of Patti’s most well-known songs, but it’s one of her finest.</p>
<p>“Play Around” is a perfect spotlight for Patti’s vocals and songwriting. Both the strength of her shaded lyrics and her resolute (with just a hint of vulnerable) vocals shine through in an intimate arrangement that features Bruce noticeably but firmly in the background (as he should be) on Hammond B-3 organ, until he trails off playing out the song, sounding for all the world like the little boy Patti sings about.</p>
<p>“Play Around” is a great track on a start-to-finish standout album.</p>
