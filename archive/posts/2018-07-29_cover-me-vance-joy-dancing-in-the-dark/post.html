<p>This one’s my favorite, from June 7, 2014 in Toronto. Something about his vocals and his expressions perfectly capture the deep-set frustration and isolation at the root of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/12/25/roll-of-the-dice-dancing-in-the-dark/">Dancing in the Dark.</a>”</p>
<p>There’s some beautiful camera work at play here, but Vance’s performance is commanding on its own.</p>
