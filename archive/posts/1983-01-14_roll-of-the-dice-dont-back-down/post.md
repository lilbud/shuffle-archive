For every song that made it onto *Born in the U.S.A.,* Bruce wrote five more that didn’t. We’ve listened to many of them on this blog over the past four years, and we’ll listen to more before we bring this journey to a close.

“Don’t Back Down” is one of those coulda-been-a-contender songs, if only Bruce had released it.

Bruce actually had two different works-in progress by that name during his L.A. Garage sessions, one of which became “Don’t Back Down (On Our Love),” and both of which were finally released in 2025 on *L.A. Garage Sessions ’83*.

Its origins begin at least a year before Bruce recorded the released version, in this brief and *very* rough home demo from late 1981 or early 1982.

By early 1983, Bruce had fashioned a full song and recorded it alone, accompanied by a drum machine.

Lyrically, I’d argue that the released version of “Don’t Back Down” is still a work in progress: the third verse is just the first verse repeated and the second verse sounds at least lightly bluffed–but this is still a fully formed pop song with verses in the mold of “Two Hearts” and a refrain reminiscent of “No Surrender.”

*If you’re out on your own and you ain’t got a home*  
*And it feels like the whole world’s just gonna fall on you*  
*You’re just running scared, look around, there’s nothing there*  
*And you ain’t got the strength and your friends all just stall on you*  
*A roar comes up loud and you’re lost in the crowd*  
*Once you thought you might make it, but babe, these days you doubt it*  
*If you need a hand, honey, I understand*  
*Just stand on up, yeah, stand up and shout it girl*

*Don’t back down, don’t back down*  
*Don’t back down, don’t back down*  
*Don’t back down, don’t back down*  
*Don’t back down, don’t back down*

*Now you see all the ones worn out and tired*  
*There’s a fool all broken down by the wayside*  
*With two hearts call out for hire*  
*Filled with hurt, defeated by their foolish pride*  
*Girl, you hear the sound of a one comin’ down*  
*And you don’t think that these days you can make it, babe*  
*Just step on up, I’ll give a hand*  
*And if you ain’t got a problem, maybe we can shake it, baby*

*Don’t back down, don’t back down*  
*Don’t back down, don’t back down*  
*Don’t back down, don’t back down*  
*Don’t back down, don’t back down*

These aren’t Bruce’s deepest lyrics, but with a hook like that and a beat that doesn’t let up for even a moment’s breath, “Don’t Back Down” didn’t need depth to be a hit.

It just needed to be released.
