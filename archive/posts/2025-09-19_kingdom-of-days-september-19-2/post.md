**1970:** Local bands hold a benefit concert at Point Pleasant Beach to raise legal defense funds for those arrested at the [Clearwater Swim Club fiasco](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/09/11/kingdom-of-days-september-11/) the week prior. Steel Mill doesn’t play (possibly because Vini is still in Richmond and Danny is on the lam), but they lend their sound equipment for the cause.

**1978:** Bruce and the band play one of their most legendary shows, opening a three-night homecoming stand at the Capitol Theater in Passaic with an epic show that is broadcast live from Boston to Baltimore.

(And then get the entire show’s audio [here](http://live.brucespringsteen.net/live-music/0,22963/Bruce-Springsteen---The-E-Street-Band-mp3-flac-download-9-19-1978-Capitol-Theatre-Passaic-NJ.html)–it’s available as part of Bruce’s official archive series.)

**1985:** Bruce and the E Street Band play their second of two Born in the U.S.A. shows at the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum, but this show is a little rougher: listen to Bruce forget the lyrics to “Highway Patrolman.”
