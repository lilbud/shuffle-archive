**1970:** Local bands hold a benefit concert at Point Pleasant Beach to raise legal defense funds for those arrested at the [Clearwater Swim Club fiasco](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/09/11/kingdom-of-days-september-11/) the week prior. Steel Mill doesn’t play (possibly because Vini is still in Richmond and Danny is on the lam), but they lend their sound equipment for the cause.
