<p>Here’s a timely cover: Three times only, on the original River tour, Bruce and the E Street Band covered the classic CCR anti-gun polemic, “Run Through the Jungle.”</p>
<p>Bruce’s take on the song is quieter, slower and more taut than the original, with a mid-song key change to escalate the tension. If he performed it today, he’d have to update the lyrics, too–we’re at 300 million guns today and counting.</p>
<p>Here’s Bruce’s first of only three performances ever of “Run Through the Jungle.”</p>

<p>Interestingly, Bruce’s version has extra verses, presumably written by him. Compare with the original Creedence Clearwater Revival version:</p>

<p>A couple of those new lyrics would turn up later in the year in a new song Bruce was working on but was never released: “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/02/02/roll-of-the-dice-bells-of-san-salvador/">Bells of San Salvador.</a>”</p>
<p>But that’s a story for another time.</p>
