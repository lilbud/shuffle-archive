<p>I had a completely different cover queued up for today and a week’s worth of posts written to follow.</p>
<p>But yesterday morning, I came across a brand new cover of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/08/08/roll-of-the-dice-tougher-than-the-rest/">Tougher Than the Rest</a>” by an Italian duo called The Travel Bag, and I’ve played it about a dozen times since.</p>
<p>(I know next to nothing about The Travel Bag except that they consist of Jole Maddalena on vocals and Claudio D’amico on guitar, they’ve got an original <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/2g2DcaxnQiHrezeaNOzm3n">album</a> you can stream on the major streaming services, their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZvqn0hu-6_KK5JUB2LGb0w">YouTube page</a> is full of beautiful cover performances, and you should definitely check them out.)</p>
<p>So since I can’t seem to shake my obsession with this absolutely gorgeous-in-every-way performance, I’m bumping the queue so you can enjoy it along with me.</p>
<p>Have a great weekend.</p>
