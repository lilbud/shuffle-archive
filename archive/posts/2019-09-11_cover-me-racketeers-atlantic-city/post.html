<p>I don’t know much about this New York City-based Irish band than what I’ve already typed, but I hope we hear more from them in the future.</p>
<p>They started a Youtube channel five months ago, and their most recent video is a beautiful cover of Bruce’s “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/06/04/roll-of-the-dice-atlantic-city/">Atlantic City</a>.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IMJl9YpabY">Watch on Youtube: Racketeers   Atlantic City (Bruce Springsteen Cover)</a></p>
<p>Performed by the duo purely on acoustic guitar, mandolin, and harmonica, they perfectly capture the essence of Bruce’s original album arrangement.</p>
<p>This is very, very well done.</p>
