I don’t know much about this New York City-based Irish band than what I’ve already typed, but I hope we hear more from them in the future.

They started a Youtube channel five months ago, and their most recent video is a beautiful cover of Bruce’s “[Atlantic City](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/06/04/roll-of-the-dice-atlantic-city/).”

Performed by the duo purely on acoustic guitar, mandolin, and harmonica, they perfectly capture the essence of Bruce’s original album arrangement.

This is very, very well done.
