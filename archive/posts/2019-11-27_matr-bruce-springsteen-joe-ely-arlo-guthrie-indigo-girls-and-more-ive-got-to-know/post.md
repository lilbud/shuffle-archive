On September 29, 1996, Bruce joined a stellar roster of musicians on stage at Cleveland’s Severance Hall to pay tribute to Woody Guthrie.

Among the tracks performed that night: Woody’s “I’ve Got to Know,” featuring contributions by Bruce, Joe Ely, Arlo Guthrie, The Indigo Girls, Ani DiFranco, Billy Bragg, Country Joe McDonald, David Pirner, and Ramblin’ Jack Elliott.

This is the only time Bruce is known to have performed this song.
