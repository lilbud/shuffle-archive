<p>Just before the Rising Tour kicked off, new E Streeter Soozie Tyrell found time to record her debut album, <em>White Lines. </em>Soozie proved herself to be a great singer-songwriter, and the entire album is worth a listen.</p>
<p>One track in particular, though, has a strong Bruce connection: “Ste. Genevieve” is a lovely folk song about perseverance through adversity, in this case a flood that devastates a small town. It’s easy to see why the song would appeal to Bruce, and why he agreed to lend his vocals (along with Patti’s) to the track.</p>

<p>In the interview below, Soozie explains how it all came about.</p>
