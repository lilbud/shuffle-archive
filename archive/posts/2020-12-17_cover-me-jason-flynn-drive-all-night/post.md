Mysteriously, all traces of Jason Flynn seem to have been scrubbed from the Internet–web site, social media, videos… strange. I hope he’s okay. I did find one stray copy of his wonderful “Drive All Night” cover however–it’s not as great as the earlier clips I featured here, but it’s worth watching nonetheless.

I have a soft spot for buskers, especially those who appreciate the music of Bruce Springsteen.

So while I don’t know anything about this particular street musician to provide as background, I nevertheless encourage you to take six minutes out of your day to enjoy Jason Flynn’s beautiful cover of Bruce’s timeless love song, “.”

Flynn’s rendition is more tender than Bruce’s original. If Bruce’s version is a powerful declaration of the lengths he’d go to for his girl, Flynn’s version is a quiet but confident pledge of devotion. It’s simply a beautiful performance.
