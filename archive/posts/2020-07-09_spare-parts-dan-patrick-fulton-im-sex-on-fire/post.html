<p>It’s pretty tough to do something new with “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/09/11/roll-of-the-dice-im-on-fire/">I’m on Fire</a>” — it’s very likely the most covered song in Bruce’s catalog.</p>
<p>Dan Patrick Fulton pulls it off, though, by mashing it up with “Sex on Fire” by Kings of Leon–a neat pairing that works both musically and thematically.</p>

<p>Dan gets bonus points for going all in with full costume dress and some fantastic editing, too.</p>
