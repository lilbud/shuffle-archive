<p>A rare instrumental cover by Bruce, “Once Upon a Time in the West” is a composition by Italian composer Ennio Morricone. Bruce has often used it as walk-on music in Italy, and in 2006 he recorded a solo electric guitar instrumental version at his home studio.</p>
<p>Italian conductor Luigi Caiola arranged an orchestral overlay and recorded the the Unione Musicisti Di Roma performing it.</p>
<p>The result was an absolutely gorgeous and romantic piece of music, officially released on a Morricone tribute album in February 2007.</p>
