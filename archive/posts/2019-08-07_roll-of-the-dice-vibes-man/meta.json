It&#8217;s fitting that &#8220;Vibes Man&#8221; gets the <em>Roll of the Dice</em> treatment first, however, because as we&#8217;re about to see, the story of &#8220;New York City Serenade&#8221; begins with (and largely derives from) this early demo.</p>\n<p>Throughout the first half of 1973, while Bruce was touring behind his first album, he frequently performed a work-in-progress &#8220;New York Song&#8221; (which we&#8217;ll also cover here someday). When Bruce&#8217;s second album dropped toward the end of the year with a song called &#8220;New York City Serenade,&#8221; fans (such few as there were back then) might have expected to hear a polished version of the &#8220;New York Song&#8221; they&#8217;d been hearing evolve on stage.</p>\n<p>But while &#8220;New York City Serenade&#8221; certainly traces its lineage in part to &#8220;New York Song,&#8221; the earlier prototype is dramatically different than the final product.</p>\n<p>&#8220;New York City Serenade&#8221; features characters and scenes not even hinted at in &#8220;New York Song.&#8221; Where did they come from?</p>\n<p>As it turns out, they came from &#8220;Vibes Man.&#8221;</p>\n<p>All the while he was performing &#8220;New York Song&#8221; on stage, Bruce had been working on another song with some familiar lyrics. In early 1973 (shortly after the release of\u00a0<em>Greetings From Asbury Park</em>), he recorded it in the studio, accompanying himself on the piano.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s take a listen:</p>\n<div id=\"v-cQLEEsa9-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='426' src='https://videopress.com/embed/cQLEEsa9?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>Bruce&#8217;s lyrics for &#8220;Vibes Man&#8221; are so very close to what would become &#8220;New York City Serenade&#8221; that I&#8217;ll save my line-by-line analysis for that future essay.</p>\n<p>But there are a couple of differences that bear mention&#8211;the first of which is the &#8220;fish lady verse.&#8221; Besides the change from third person to second person narration (which places the singer more immediately in the action), there&#8217;s that stunning second couplet:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Fish lady, don&#8217;t you bait those tenement walls</em><br />\n<em>Don&#8217;t take corner boys, because they&#8217;re too easy</em><br />\n<em>You were born black and blue</em><br />\n<em>You didn&#8217;t have to wait for somebody to hit you</em></p>\n<p>That&#8217;s a terrific (if disturbing) metaphor, and I&#8217;m genuinely surprised that Bruce never found a home for it another song. (Why he even dropped it for &#8220;New York City Serenade&#8221; is a mystery.)</p>\n<p>The other part of the song that interests me is the extended &#8220;she won&#8217;t take the train&#8221; passage that concludes the song. In &#8220;New York City Serenade,&#8221; the night train seems metaphorical&#8211;an invitation for Fish Lady to leave behind her daily grind and embrace the night.</p>\n<p>But in &#8220;Vibes Man&#8221; the train is more literal&#8211;it&#8217;s the train that would take Fish Lady to the narrator&#8217;s home (and presumably bed) if she&#8217;d only take it. The tracks, however, are as metaphorical as ever.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Won&#8217;t you come home with me?</em><br />\n<em>Won&#8217;t you come home with me?</em><br />\n<em>But no, &#8217;cause she won&#8217;t take a train</em><br />\n<em>Oh, she won&#8217;t take that train</em><br />\n<em>She won&#8217;t take a train</em><br />\n<em>No, she won&#8217;t take that train</em><br />\n<em>She won&#8217;t take a train</em><br />\n<em>Oh, no, she won&#8217;t take that train</em><br />\n<em>Lord, she won&#8217;t take a train</em><br />\n<em>Oh, ah, no, she won&#8217;t take that train</em><br />\n<em>You won&#8217;t take the train</em><br />\n<em>She won&#8217;t take the train</em><br />\n<em>Cause she&#8217;s afraid those tracks are gonna slow her down</em><br />\n<em>And when she turns around</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;m gonna be gone like the notes in any man&#8217;s song</em></p>\n<p>But oh, that last line: as gorgeous as the music is that accompanies its replacement line (&#8220;So long&#8230; sometimes you just gotta walk on&#8221;), Bruce&#8217;s first attempt above was much stronger.</p>\n<p>Musically, &#8220;Vibes Man&#8221; can&#8217;t hold a candle to &#8220;New York City Serenade.&#8221; The latter song holds up even in today&#8217;s <em>Western Stars </em>era as one of Bruce&#8217;s lushest, most artistically arranged songs.</p>\n<p>But lyrically, it reflects Bruce&#8217;s rapidly developing songwriting skill and provides keen insight into his not-too-distant future classic.</p>\n<p><strong>Vibes Man<br />\nRecorded:</strong> February 1973 (demo)<br />\n<strong>Never released</strong><br />\n<strong>Never performed</strong></p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
