Although our narrator is searching for his way home, there&#8217;s nothing in the song (save for a single line in the last verse) that implies driving.</p>\n<p>Like many of Bruce&#8217;s best songs, &#8220;Radio Nowhere&#8221; operates on multiple levels simultaneously: Is our hero a once-popular musician abandoned by modern audiences? Or perhaps an aging music lover out of step with modern tastes? A pundit warning us of the danger posed by technology to our societal bonds? An ex-lover unable to move past a messy break-up? Or maybe someone suffering from depression, detached and self-distanced from his friends and family?</p>\n<p>My money&#8217;s on all of the above (Bruce has mined those themes before and since), but one thing&#8217;s for certain: our narrator is lost and lonely.</p>\n<p>That drone could be the indistinguishable sameness of modern music. It might be the static between stations. A dial tone. That voice in your head that sabotages your relationships. Deafening silence.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s empty, and it&#8217;s distant. (It&#8217;s relayed by satellite, after all.)</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>This is radio nowhere, is there anybody alive out there?</em></p>\n<p>Springsteen fans recognize the chorus on first listen with a thrill: it&#8217;s the phrase Bruce often yells in concert when he wants to dial his audience engagement up to twelve. It&#8217;s a farcical if not rhetorical question, and we recognize it for what it is: a demand for us to do our part and match his investment in the moment.</p>\n<p>But in this song, it&#8217;s a desperate and lonely plaint:\u00a0<em>I&#8217;m alone. Is there\u00a0<strong>anyone</strong> out there for me?</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I was spinning &#8217;round a dead dial</em><br />\n<em>Just another lost number in a file</em><br />\n<em>Dancing down a dark hole</em><br />\n<em>Just searching for a world with some soul</em></p>\n<p>I love this verse, because it&#8217;s deceptive in its pop simplicity. There&#8217;s a lot of songwriting artistry at work here, however, and it&#8217;s worth taking a moment to admire it.</p>\n<p>That first couplet is especially clever: The dead dial belongs to both a radio and rotary telephone; the lost number belongs to both a bygone favorite radio station and an ex-lover or friend.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Dancing down a dark hole&#8221; keeps the musical metaphor going while making it clear that the narrator is in a dark emotional place, likely a depressive episode. And &#8220;some soul&#8221; refers both to the music genre and human connection.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>This is radio nowhere, is there anybody alive out there?</em></p>\n<p>The vocal bridge is a scream into the void:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I just want to hear some rhythm!</em><br />\n<em>I just want to hear some rhythm!</em><br />\n<em>I just want to hear some rhythm!</em><br />\n<em>I just want to hear some rhythm!</em></p>\n<p>What&#8217;s another word for\u00a0<em>rhythm</em>? Beat. Pulse. These are signs of life we&#8217;re looking for.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I want a thousand guitars</em><br />\n<em>I want pounding drums</em><br />\n<em>I want a million different voices speaking in tongues</em></p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a world out there somewhere, and we&#8217;re not part of it.</p>\n<p>Bruce&#8217;s revealing video for &#8220;Radio Nowhere&#8221; shows a bustling city of anonymous strangers. Life happens in front of us, along with moments of intimacy, but they&#8217;re all viewed from a distance, intercut with photos of the singer being torn apart. (The implication is that the singer is doing it to himself.) This is one of Thom Zimny&#8217;s earliest works with Bruce, and its one of his best.</p>\n<div id=\"v-qVYvGTu5-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='408' src='https://videopress.com/embed/qVYvGTu5?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>In a contemporaneous interview, Bruce described &#8220;Radio Nowhere&#8221; as apocalyptic, &#8220;an end of the world scenario,&#8221; but that&#8217;s just its window dressing. Zimny&#8217;s video gives away the song&#8217;s true significance.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I was driving through the misty rain</em><br />\n<em>Searching for a mystery train</em><br />\n<em>Bopping through the wild blue</em><br />\n<em>Trying to make a connection with you</em></p>\n<p>Our narrator searches high and low for connection: to music (the mystery train refers to the <a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/05/21/cover-me-mystery-train/\">iconic rock song</a>) and to people.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve read suggestions that &#8220;misty rain&#8221; is a &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/01/22/roll-of-the-dice-downbound-train/\">Downbound Train</a>&#8221; callback, and that &#8220;dancing down a dark hole&#8221; refers to another <em>Born in the U.S.A.</em> track, but I think that&#8217;s reading too much into Bruce&#8217;s penchant for recycling metaphors. It&#8217;s a neat idea to think that this might be Bruce&#8217;s way of referring to his career journey (of which <em>Born in the U.S.A.</em> was his commercial apex), but if that was his intent, I doubt he&#8217;d select one of the few songs from that album that wasn&#8217;t even released as a single.)</p>\n<p>And since we&#8217;re discussing similarities to other songs, I supposed this is as good a place as any to address the musical controversy that unfortunately overshadowed a deservedly deeper discussion of &#8220;Radio Nowhere&#8221; when it first debuted.</p>\n<p>Yes, the instantly recognizable riff and chord progression of &#8220;Radio Nowhere&#8221; is unmistakably borrowed from Tommy Tutone&#8217;s &#8220;867-5309.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Tommy Tutone - 867-5309/Jenny\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6WTdTwcmxyo?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>To dismiss the similarity (as many fans and critics do) strikes me as disingenuous.</p>\n<p>But acknowledging the influence of the hit 1981 single on Bruce&#8217;s 2007 anthem shouldn&#8217;t require an ounce of defensiveness. Rock and roll is built on a tradition of recycling and upcycling, borrowing and swapping.</p>\n<p>&#8220;867-5309&#8221; and &#8220;Radio Nowhere&#8221; are very different songs lyrically and musically, and there are many songs strewn through Bruce&#8217;s catalog that share DNA with the work of artists who preceded and came after him for those who enjoy tracing that sort of thing. (I do.)</p>\n<p>It was an odd controversy at the time (fueled, no doubt, by some tongue-in-cheek comments offered by songwriter Tommy Heath when interviewed about it), and I&#8217;m glad it was much shorter-lived than the maddening &#8220;waves/sways&#8221; debate. (<em>Thank you,\u00a0</em>Jon Landau, for putting that to rest before the dice forced me to waste words on it someday.)</p>\n<p>So let&#8217;s look past the separated-at-birth riffs and appreciate the E Street Band&#8217;s performance on&#8221;Radio Nowhere&#8221; for what it is: a powerful, hard-driving, galvanizing instrumental clarion call as powerful as any in the rock canon. There&#8217;s a reason why &#8220;Radio Nowhere&#8221; tends to only appear as an opener, encore, or lead-in to a main set finale. Like &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/05/20/roll-of-the-dice-badlands/\">Badlands</a>&#8221; (with which &#8220;Radio Nowhere&#8221; shares common traits), it reliably rallies the audience to the peak of emotion, energy, and zeal required for the moment&#8230; even at 8:45 in the morning.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Radio Nowhere (Live) [HQ TV version]\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/h8Xb8Cq9NrI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>That was one of Bruce&#8217;s earliest performances of &#8220;Radio Nowhere.&#8221; The song quickly became a set list staple, opening most shows on the Magic Tour and carrying through to the Working on a Dream and Wrecking Ball tours and beyond.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Radio Nowhere (London Calling: Live In Hyde Park, 2009)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HpdKECVnoRs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>It should also be mentioned that when Jay Weinberg filled in for his dad on drums during the 2009 tour, he absolutely\u00a0<em>owned</em> &#8220;Radio Nowhere,&#8221; elevating it to a new level with his fierce playing.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Radio Nowhere with Jay Weinberg - Philly April 29 2009\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NOA6a3LTGso?start=1&#038;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>When it came to airplay, however, Bruce&#8217;s song went&#8230; well, radio nowhere.

(It did, however, chart in other countries.) &#8220;Radio Nowhere&#8221; fared better at the Grammy Awards, where it earned Bruce an award for Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance.</p>\n<p>The failure of &#8220;Radio Nowhere&#8221; to chart signaled that Bruce&#8217;s days of commercial success were behind him.
