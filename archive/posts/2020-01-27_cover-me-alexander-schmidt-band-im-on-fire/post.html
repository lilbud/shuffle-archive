<p>But here’s a version that warrants lifting the ban.</p>
<p>I don’t know much about the Alexander Schmidt Band, and the band itself isn’t very helpful in that regard. (Their YouTube “about page reads simply “…just music.”)</p>
<p>But their bluegrass-esque arrangement is wonderful, their harmonies are ethereal, and they turn in a beautiful version of Bruce’s too-often-covered original that deserves to be heard.</p>
<p>So take a listen and enjoy.</p>
