<p>There are <a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/?s=i%27m+on+fire">so many covers</a> of Bruce Springsteen’s “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/09/11/roll-of-the-dice-im-on-fire/">I’m on Fire</a>” floating around out there that I had to put a temporary moratorium on featuring them on this blog to avoid accidentally creating its own sub-blog.</p>
<p>But here’s a version that warrants lifting the ban.</p>
<p>I don’t know much about the Alexander Schmidt Band, and the band itself isn’t very helpful in that regard. (Their YouTube “about page reads simply “…just music.”)</p>
<p>But their bluegrass-esque arrangement is wonderful, their harmonies are ethereal, and they turn in a beautiful version of Bruce’s too-often-covered original that deserves to be heard.</p>
<p>So take a listen and enjoy.</p>
