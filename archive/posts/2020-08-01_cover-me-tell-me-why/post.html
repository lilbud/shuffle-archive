<p>Not many concert venues are declared U.S. Historic Landmarks,  but Atlantic City’s Boardwalk Hall is one of them.</p>
<p>From its opening days in 1929 through the present, the hall has played host to Miss America pageants, political conventions, sporting events, and of course concerts.</p>
<p>In 1964, The Beatles were on their first American Tour, and Boardwalk Hall (then known as Convention Hall) was one of their biggest venues. So when Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band rolled into town for their first Atlantic City show almost four decades later on the Rising Tour, Bruce decided to pay tribute to the biggest act ever to play that building.</p>
<p>The song Bruce chose wasn’t in The Beatles’ set list that night in 1964, but its A-side was. “Tell Me Why” was released on the soundtrack for <em>A Hard Day’s Night</em>, but it also backed the single for “If I Fell.”</p>

<p>“Tell Me Why” was an unusual choice, but it was an inspired, crowd-pleasing one–a perfect way to kick off the encores.</p>

<p>That night in 2003 was the first and only time Bruce has played “Tell Me Why” in public, but he played it before and since in private settings, at his annual Stone Pony benefit shows for the Rumson Country Day School in 2002 and 2003.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> Before Bruce and the E Street Band played “Tell Me Why” in Atlantic City, they rehearsed it at sound check. Let’s eavesdrop on them working out the song.</p>
