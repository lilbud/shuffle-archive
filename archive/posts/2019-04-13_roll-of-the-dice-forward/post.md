The dice must be obeyed.

And today, the dice have landed on this unreleased, rarely performed Springsteen original: “Forward!”

Written in late 2012 by request from President Obama, this became the unofficial final-days campaign song for the Obama ’12 campaign.

And the moral for Barack Obama was: be careful what you wish for. Because when you ask Bruce Springsteen to write a campaign song for you, and he does, you kind of have to use it at that point. Which is how we wound up with this:

The song actually grew by a couple of lines over the three weeks and seven rallies where her performed it, but it wasn’t the stronger for it. Obama won anyway.

Somehow, I don’t think we’re going to see this one included in a box set any time soon.
