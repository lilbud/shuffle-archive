**1988:** At Night Two in Stockholm on the Tunnel of Love Tour, the show is broadcast on radio stations around the world. Bruce plays “[Downbound Train](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/01/22/roll-of-the-dice-downbound-train/)” and “[Quarter to Three](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/08/21/cover-me-quarter-to-three/)” for the first time on the tour, and he announces his participation in the upcoming Amnesty International Human Rights Tour. Bruce performs “[Chimes of Freedom](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/07/18/roll-of-the-dice-cover-me-chimes-of-freedom/)” immediately after the announcement, and that performance will be officially released as the title track of an EP later in the year. The entire show is now available as part of the official archive series (get it [here](https://live.brucespringsteen.net/live-music/0,18398/Bruce-Springsteen---The-E-Street-Band-mp3-flac-download-7-3-1988-Stockholms-Stadion-Stockholm-SE.html), and listen to the original radio pre- and post-shows below) and is well worth many repeated listens.
