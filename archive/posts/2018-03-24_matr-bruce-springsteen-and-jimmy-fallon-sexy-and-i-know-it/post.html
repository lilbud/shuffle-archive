<p>To promote Bruce’s new <a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2023/03/28/album-companion-wrecking-ball/"><em>Wrecking Ball </em></a>album, Jimmy Fallon declared the last days of February 2012 and the first days of March as “Bruce Springsteen Week,” featuring interviews with and performances by the artist himself.</p>
<p>Bruce did more than debut his own new material, though: he also spoofed himself by donning his 1980s uniform (and hair!) and joining Jimmy Fallon-as-Neil Young for an inspired cover of LMFAO’s “Sexy and I Know It.”</p>
