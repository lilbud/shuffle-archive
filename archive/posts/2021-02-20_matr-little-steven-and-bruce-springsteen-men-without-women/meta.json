We clearly sense that <em>these</em> two men are about to do the things that men without women do.</p>\n<p>But vocals shouldn&#8217;t be our sole focus here, because &#8220;Men Without Women&#8221; is a great &#8220;secret&#8221; E Street Band track. They&#8217;re not the only performers on the song (and not all of the band is present), but Garry&#8217;s bass is prominent in the mix, Max&#8217;s punctuation is unmistakable, and Danny&#8217;s organ is the last thing we hear.</p>\n<p>As with &#8220;Angel Eyes,&#8221; Bruce and Steve have never performed &#8220;Men Without Women&#8221; together in concert, but with Steve&#8217;s solo career on a creative upswing, who knows&#8230; maybe that will change soon.</p>\n<p><strong>Men Without Women<br />\nRecorded:</strong> November 1981<br />\n<strong>Released:</strong>\u00a0<em>Men Without Women\u00a0</em>(1982)<br />\n<strong>Never performed</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>Bruce was working on what would become Nebraska in the autumn of 1981, but he still found time to contribute vocals to the title track of Little Steven&#8217;s debut album. </p>\n", "protected": false}, "author": 1, "featured_media": 18232, "comment_status": "open", "ping_status": "open", "sticky": false, "template": "", "format": "standard", "meta": {"_monsterinsights_skip_tracking": false, "_monsterinsights_sitenote_active": false, "_monsterinsights_sitenote_note": "", "_monsterinsights_sitenote_category": 0, "jetpack_post_was_ever_published": false, "_jetpack_newsletter_access": "", "_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs": false, "_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id": 0, "_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content": false, "_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content": false, "footnotes": "", "jetpack_publicize_message": "", "jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled": true, "jetpack_social_post_already_shared": true, "jetpack_social_options": {"image_generator_settings": {"template": "highway", "default_image_id": 0, "font": "", "enabled": false}, "version": 2}}, "categories": [5], "tags": [1486, 2020], "class_list": ["post-15482", "post", "type-post", "status-publish", "format-standard", "has-post-thumbnail", "hentry", "category-meeting-across-the-river", "tag-little-steven-and-the-disciples-of-soul", "tag-men-without-women"], "aioseo_notices": [], "jetpack_publicize_connections": [], "jetpack_featured_media_url": "https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/mww.jpg?fit=1414%2C1414&ssl=1", "jetpack_sharing_enabled": true, "jetpack_shortlink": "https://wp.me/p9w3Lk-41I", "jetpack_likes_enabled": true, "jetpack-related-posts": [{"id": 11078, "url": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/07/26/matr-little-steven-and-bruce-springsteen-angel-eyes/", "url_meta": {"origin": 15482, "position": 0}, "title": "MatR: Little Steven and Bruce Springsteen, Angel Eyes", "author": "Ken", "date": "July 26, 2019", "format": false, "excerpt": "Listen closely to Little Steven's love song \"Angel Eyes,\" and you'll hear the unmistakable (but uncredited) backing vocals of Bruce Springsteen.", "rel": "", "context": "In &quot;Meeting Across the River&quot;", "block_context": {"text": "Meeting Across the River", "link": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/category/meeting-across-the-river/"}, "img": {"alt_text": "", "src": "https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/little-steven-and-the-disciples-of-soul-angel-eyes-emi-america.jpg?fit=793%2C800&ssl=1&resize=350%2C200", "width": 350, "height": 200, "srcset": "https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/little-steven-and-the-disciples-of-soul-angel-eyes-emi-america.jpg?fit=793%2C800&ssl=1&resize=350%2C200 1x, https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/little-steven-and-the-disciples-of-soul-angel-eyes-emi-america.jpg?fit=793%2C800&ssl=1&resize=525%2C300 1.5x, https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/little-steven-and-the-disciples-of-soul-angel-eyes-emi-america.jpg?fit=793%2C800&ssl=1&resize=700%2C400 2x"}, "classes": []}, {"id": 5729, "url": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/11/17/meeting-across-the-river-little-steven-and-bruce-springsteen-until-the-good-is-gone/", "url_meta": {"origin": 15482, "position": 1}, "title": "Meeting Across the River: Little Steven and Bruce Springsteen, Until the Good is Gone", "author": "Ken", "date": "November 17, 2018", "format": false, "excerpt": "\"Until the Good is Gone\" is one of Steve's earliest and best solo efforts, featuring uncredited but unmistakable backing vocals from Bruce.
