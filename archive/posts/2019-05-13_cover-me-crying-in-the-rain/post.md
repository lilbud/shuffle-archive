You might think that The Everly Brothers’ “Crying in the Rain” is an unlikely candidate for a Bruce Springsteen cover treatment, but…

Well, actually you’d be right. Bruce has never covered it. Not officially, at least, but at least once on the Tunnel of Love Express Tour, he played it during a sound check. Given the song’s heartbreak theme, it makes sense that it sprung to mind while rehearsing that tour’s love-centric main set.

Fortunately, that moment was captured on tape, so let’s take a listen to that recording from May 6, 1988 in Tacoma, Washington.

While the recording is more than a bit distant, it’s clear enough for us to make out the entire song and recognize it as a faithful version of the Everlys’ original.

That original–a one-off collaboration between Carole King and Howard Greenfield–peaked at #6 on the Billboard Hot 100 upon its release in 1962.
