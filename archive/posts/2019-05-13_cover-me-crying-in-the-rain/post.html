<p>You might think that The Everly Brothers’ “Crying in the Rain” is an unlikely candidate for a Bruce Springsteen cover treatment, but…</p>
<p>Well, actually you’d be right. Bruce has never covered it. Not officially, at least, but at least once on the Tunnel of Love Express Tour, he played it during a sound check. Given the song’s heartbreak theme, it makes sense that it sprung to mind while rehearsing that tour’s love-centric main set.</p>
<p>Fortunately, that moment was captured on tape, so let’s take a listen to that recording from May 6, 1988 in Tacoma, Washington.</p>

<p>While the recording is more than a bit distant, it’s clear enough for us to make out the entire song and recognize it as a faithful version of the Everlys’ original.</p>

<p>That original–a one-off collaboration between Carole King and Howard Greenfield–peaked at #6 on the Billboard Hot 100 upon its release in 1962.</p>
