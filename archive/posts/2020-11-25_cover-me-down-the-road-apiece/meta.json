Bruce fronted the band through &#8220;Hungry Heart&#8221; seven times through that day, and to break it up a bit for their video shoot audience, they interspersed a few covers into the set&#8211;the first of which was, &#8220;Down the Road Apiece.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Down The Road Apiece\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jwbwL5s12wo?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>That Berlin performance might have been a one-off, if not for Joe Grushecky.
