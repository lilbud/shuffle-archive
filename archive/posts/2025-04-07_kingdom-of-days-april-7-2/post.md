Earlier that same day, Bruce and Dave Sancious drop by WMMR-FM in Philadelphia to play guest DJ with host David Dye.

**1976:** Bruce and the E Street Band bring the Chicken Scratch Tour to Cleveland for the first of two nights, to at least one underwhelming review. Earlier in the day, Kid Leo interviews Bruce on WMMS-FM radio.

**1981:** The European leg of The River Tour finally kicks off with Bruce’s first-ever show in Germany–at Congress Centrum in Hamburg, where Bruce covers “Rockin’ All Over the World” for the first time.

**1995:** An interview with Australian journalist Molly Meldrum goes off the rails: scheduled as a fifteen-minute conversation at Sony Studios in New York as part of the promotional plan for *Greatest Hits*, Meldrum pushes forward tenaciously for a full ninety minutes, pressing Bruce for insights on his catalog with the deep knowledge and command of minutiae that only an obsessive fan could draw from. The result is fascinating–an essential listen for any serious Bruce fan.

…and that interview isn’t the only one Bruce does today. I don’t know if it’s before or after, but Bruce also sits down with MTV’s Kurt Loder for an interview that will air the following month on MTV’s Week in Rock. (You can tell from the same shirt he’s wearing in the video below.)

**2006:** Bruce rehearses with the Sessions Band at Asbury Park’s Paramount Theater, preparing for their upcoming tour.

**2008:** Tom Morello makes a guest appearance at the Magic Tour stop in Anaheim. The new arrangement of “[The Ghost of Tom Joad](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/10/17/roll-of-the-dice-the-ghost-of-tom-joad/)” that Bruce and Tom work up will become a fan favorite and eventually become an officially released track in both studio and live form (on *High Hopes* and *Magic Tour Highlights*, respectively). Tom isn’t the only guest-star, though: Bobby Bandiera joins for “[Ramrod](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/09/10/roll-of-the-dice-ramrod/),” and Marty Rifkin and Marc Anthony Thompson join for a mini-Sessions Band reunion on “[American Land](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/01/10/roll-of-the-dice-american-land/).”

**2009:** Bruce and the E Street Band return to Oklahoma after an absence of more than three decades. Their Working on a Dream show at the Bok Center in Tulsa features the tour premieres of “[I’m Goin’ Down](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/06/05/roll-of-the-dice-im-goin-down/)” and “[I’m on Fire](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/09/11/roll-of-the-dice-im-on-fire/).”

Patti isn’t present tonight, so theatergoers get the “B” setlist featuring “[Long Time Comin’](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/06/19/roll-of-the-dice-long-time-comin/)” and “[The Ghost of Tom Joad](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/10/17/roll-of-the-dice-the-ghost-of-tom-joad/)” in place of “[Brilliant Disguise](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/02/06/roll-of-the-dice-brilliant-disguise/)” and “[Tougher Than the Rest.](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/08/08/roll-of-the-dice-tougher-than-the-rest/)”

**2023:** “[Lucky Town](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/05/24/roll-of-the-dice-lucky-town/)” makes its tour premiere when Bruce and the E Street Band bring their World Tour to CFG Bank Arena in Baltimore.

**2024:** Art imitates life (or maybe the other way around, given when the episode was filmed) when Bruce gets COVID on a new episode of *Curb Your Enthusiasm*.

Thankfully, real-life Bruce Springsteen is hale and healthy tonight, performing his second show at Kia Forum in Inglewood, California. He opens with the tour premiere of “[Open All Nigh](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/10/28/roll-of-the-dice-open-all-night/)t,” and Tom Morello makes a guest appearance for the tour premieres of “American Skin (41 Shots)” and “The Ghost of Tom Joad.”
