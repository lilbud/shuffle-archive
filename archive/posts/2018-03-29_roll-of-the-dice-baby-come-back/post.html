<p>Another unfinished home demo recording for what would eventually become <em>The River</em> album (the dice have chosen a few of those lately), “Baby Come Back” is far enough along to get a pretty good sense of the song’s meaning: we’re in “<a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/11/10/roll-of-the-dice-back-in-your-arms/">Back in Your Arms</a>” territory, with a narrator who stood proud and silent and let his baby walk away–and of course has regretted it ever since.</p>

<p>Lyrically and musically, however, “Baby Come Back” appears to be a true cast-off–I don’t believe any of the lyrics or music surfaced anywhere else in Bruce’s catalog. We’ll just have to wait and see someday whether “Baby Come Back” ever made it to final form and into the vault.</p>
