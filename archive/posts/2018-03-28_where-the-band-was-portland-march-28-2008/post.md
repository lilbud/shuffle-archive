Bruce doesn’t make it up to the Pacific Northwest that often, so when he does, I try to catch the entire Portland-Seattle-Vancouver swing (almost always in that order).

Portland usually gets the Night One honors, which typically means a short, predictable show–and this night on the Magic tour was no exception.

The show was definitely on the short side (hard to believe that the shows grew from 2:20 mid-way through the Magic tour to 4:00+ by the end of 2016), and the crowd was, too (the arena wasn’t even close to sold out)–but Bruce made up for the short duration with high-voltage intensity, kicking things off with “[Night](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/10/31/roll-of-the-dice-night/)” as the opener.

The setlist definitely had a retro feel: sign requests for “[For You](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/01/08/roll-of-the-dice-for-you/),” and “[Lost in the Flood](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/02/20/roll-of-the-dice-lost-in-the-flood/)” combined with half of [*Darkness on the Edge of Town*](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/07/05/album-companion-darkness-on-the-edge-of-town/) almost made this a dark, grim show.

Almost.

My most vivid memory from that show is the big group of lesbians in the pit with us, rocking out and having a blast. How do I know they were lesbians? Because they were all wearing t-shirts emblazoned “Lesbians (heart) Bruce!” Every time he noticed them, Bruce cracked up, and by the encore, he was playing directly to them, giving a shout-out in “[American Land](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/01/10/roll-of-the-dice-american-land/)” to “…the lesbians and the Jews!” If the main set was intense, the encore was a big party.

In short, a fun show, and serviceable if predictable opener for a three-night PacNW stand. Nights Two and Three would bring their share of surprises and then some.
