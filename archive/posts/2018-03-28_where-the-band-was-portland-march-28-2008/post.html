<p>Portland usually gets the Night One honors, which typically means a short, predictable show–and this night on the Magic tour was no exception.</p>
<p>The show was definitely on the short side (hard to believe that the shows grew from 2:20 mid-way through the Magic tour to 4:00+ by the end of 2016), and the crowd was, too (the arena wasn’t even close to sold out)–but Bruce made up for the short duration with high-voltage intensity, kicking things off with “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/10/31/roll-of-the-dice-night/">Night</a>” as the opener.</p>

<p>The setlist definitely had a retro feel: sign requests for “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/01/08/roll-of-the-dice-for-you/">For You</a>,” and “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/02/20/roll-of-the-dice-lost-in-the-flood/">Lost in the Flood</a>” combined with half of <a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/07/05/album-companion-darkness-on-the-edge-of-town/"><em>Darkness on the Edge of Town</em></a> almost made this a dark, grim s<span class="text_exposed_show">how.</span></p>

<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Almost.</span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">My most vivid memory from that show is the big group of lesbians in the pit with us, rocking out and having a blast. How do I know they were lesbians? Because they were all wearing t-shirts emblazoned “Lesbians (heart) Bruce!” Every time he noticed them, Bruce cracked up, and by the encore, he was playing directly to them, giving a shout-out in “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/01/10/roll-of-the-dice-american-land/">American Land</a>” to “…the lesbians and the Jews!” If the main set was intense, the encore was a big party.</span></p>
<p>In short, a fun show, and serviceable if predictable opener for a three-night PacNW stand. Nights Two and Three would bring their share of surprises and then some.</p>
