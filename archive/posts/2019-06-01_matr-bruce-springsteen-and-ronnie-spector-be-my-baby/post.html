<p>Bruce was a Ronnie Spector fan long before they ever met–and their meeting was musical providence by way of John Lennon. (Read that story <a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/09/02/meeting-across-the-river-bruce-springsteen-and-ronnie-spector-baby-i-love-you/">here</a>.)</p>
<p>On the night of November 4, 1976, Bruce finally had the chance to perform with Ronnie on stage when he invited her to join the E Street Band during their encore set at the Palladium in New York City. They performed three of her hits that night, culminating in their greatest hit. The E Street Band may not have been The Ronettes, but they were more than up for the challenge.</p>
