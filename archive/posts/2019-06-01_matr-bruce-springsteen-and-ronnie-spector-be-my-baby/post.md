And of course, the 1963 smash "Be My Baby" features the inimitable Ronnie Spector on lead vocals, along with producer Phil Spector's "wall of sound" that influenced Bruce's "Born to Run" (along with Ronnie's signature "whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh" that Bruce quotes in his own signature song).

Bruce was a Ronnie Spector fan long before they ever met–and their meeting was musical providence by way of John Lennon. (Read that story [here](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/09/02/meeting-across-the-river-bruce-springsteen-and-ronnie-spector-baby-i-love-you/).)

On the night of November 4, 1976, Bruce finally had the chance to perform with Ronnie on stage when he invited her to join the E Street Band during their encore set at the Palladium in New York City. They performed three of her hits that night, culminating in their greatest hit. The E Street Band may not have been The Ronettes, but they were more than up for the challenge.

Ronnie and Bruce would perform "Be My Baby" together four more times the following year, but even though Ronnie and Bruce have shared a stage as recently as 2016, it's been more than three decades since they last performed Ronnie's iconic hit together.
