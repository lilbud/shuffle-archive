<p>Jackson Browne’s “Our Lady of the Well” was never a hit, and it’s not even a stand-alone album track–Jackson segues right into it from the album-opening “<a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/01/18/cover-me-take-it-easy/">Take It Easy</a>” on his 1973 album, <em>For Everyman</em>.</p>

<p>And yet, “Our Lady of the Well” remains a fan favorite and a traditional show closer for Jackson, who invited Bruce to join him on stage for it (along with its album-mate, “Take It Easy”) at his show at the Count Basie Theater in Red Bank in September 2015, and again <a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/09/21/where-the-band-was-holmdel-september-21-2016/">almost two years to the day later at the Laid Back Festival in Holmdel.</a></p>
<p>The latter performance in particular features some lovely guitar work from Bruce–enjoy the performance of two long-time friends and legends below.</p>
