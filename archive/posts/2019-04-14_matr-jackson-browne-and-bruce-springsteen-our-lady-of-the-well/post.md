Jackson Browne's "Our Lady of the Well" was never a hit, and it's not even a stand-alone album track–Jackson segues right into it from the album-opening "[Take It Easy](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/01/18/cover-me-take-it-easy/)" on his 1973 album, *For Everyman*.

And yet, "Our Lady of the Well" remains a fan favorite and a traditional show closer for Jackson, who invited Bruce to join him on stage for it (along with its album-mate, "Take It Easy") at his show at the Count Basie Theater in Red Bank in September 2015, and again [almost two years to the day later at the Laid Back Festival in Holmdel.](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/09/21/where-the-band-was-holmdel-september-21-2016/)

The latter performance in particular features some lovely guitar work from Bruce–enjoy the performance of two long-time friends and legends below.
