**1975:** Bruce and the E Street Band work on what will become *Born to Run* at the Record Plant in New York City, including a version of "[Backstreets](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/05/14/roll-of-the-dice-backstreets/)" with strings.

**1977:** Bruce drops by The Stone Pony and joins The Shakes for two numbers, "[Jailhouse Rock](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/10/12/matr-bruce-springsteen-sting-billy-joel-elton-john-and-friends-jailhouse-rock/)" and "[Sea Cruise](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/04/08/cover-me-sea-cruise/)."

**1978:** Bruce and the E Street Band rehearse for the upcoming Darkness Tour at the Paramount Theater in Asbury Park. Among the songs they rehearse but never play publicly: "[Spanish Eyes](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2023/01/14/roll-of-the-dice-spanish-eyes/)," "[The Brokenhearted](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/08/20/roll-of-the-dice-the-brokenhearted/)," and "[The Way.](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/08/06/roll-of-the-dice-the-way/)" Listen to them all below, especially "The Brokenhearted," on which you can hear the original coda (Bruce obviously and jarringly recorded a new one for the version that's on *The Promise*) and "The Way," which to this day has never had a proper performance. The recording quality isn't the best, but the performance is stunning.
