<p>Here’s our second pre-ESB song this week.  Unlike “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/05/02/roll-of-the-dice-funk-song/">Funk Song</a>,” however, “I Just Can’t Change” has lyrics and is a fully realized song. Bruce wrote it in 1971, and he performed it live with the Bruce Springsteen Band through 1972, although only one specific performance is documented and recorded.</p>
<p>Although the song itself wouldn’t survive 1972, its melody was resurrected in 1975. See if you recognize it.</p>

<p>Lyrically, “I Just Can’t Change” couldn’t be any more straightforward:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Well you can come by in the morning, baby, and that’ll be alright</em><br/>
<em>Well if you wanna stop by this evening I’ll be home about nine</em><br/>
<em>Well but don’t you come around if you’re gonna act strange</em><br/>
<em>No don’t do it to me</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Because I just can’t change, babe</em><br/>
<em>I just can’t change</em><br/>
<em>No matter how I try, child</em><br/>
<em>I just can’t change</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Well you tell me how much you miss me, girl, well I miss you too</em><br/>
<em>And it’s been so long since you kissed me, don’t you think I’m about due</em><br/>
<em>But don’t you, don’t you be coming around if you’re gonna try and rearrange</em><br/>
<em>No don’t do it to me</em></p>
<p>You could take it as a “take me as I am” song, I suppose, or a resistance to being “tamed” or “domesticated,” but the final verse takes a more selfish turn:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Yes I know you’ve got a lot of love and you wanna give it to me</em><br/>
<em>But sometimes you make me crazy trying to put them chains on me, babe</em><br/>
<em>And she calls so sweetly, so discreetly on the telephone</em><br/>
<em>And she says, “how you been, babe, are you busy and are you alone”</em><br/>
<em>And I tell her, “Well if you’ve got the money then something can be arranged, child”</em></p>
<p>So maybe that’s why Bruce orphaned the song–it certainly didn’t have a sympathetic protagonist. Or maybe he just decided he could put its melody to better use, because it re-appeared in 1975 grafted to the lyrics of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/06/06/roll-of-the-dice-the-e-street-shuffle/">The E Street Shuffle</a>,” for a gorgeous arrangement that Bruce played frequently on the Born to Run tour (and which <a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/01/28/cover-me-bette-midler-the-e-street-shuffle/">Bette Midler covered </a>on vinyl and film).</p>
<p>In any event, enjoy this curious historical artifact, because this is one song we’re unlikely to hear played live again.</p>
