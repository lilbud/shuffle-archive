<p>In fact, Tenca recorded an absolutely smoking cover of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/10/31/roll-of-the-dice-factory/">Factory</a>” back in 2010, and I was all set to blog about it later this month.</p>
<p>But a few days ago, this stop-the-presses gem from 2018 showed up on YouTube, and now that “Factory” cover is going to have to wait a while–because I can’t stop listening  to Tenca’s absolutely fantastic cover of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/07/20/roll-of-the-dice-johnny-99/">Johnny 99</a>.” It’s easily my all-time favorite arrangement of the song, and that includes Bruce’s own.</p>

<p>Tenca actually recorded a live performance of “Johnny 99” back in 2011–you can find on his album <em>Live for the Working Class. </em>It’s not nearly as gloriously gritty as the performance above, but it’s still well worth checking out.</p>

<p>When this pandemic ends and I can make it back to Italy again, I’m gonna have to align my trip with one of Tenca’s shows. Until then, I’m just going to keep listening to his albums–<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPME3JN_bZBgSMpyjl4VhaA">they’re great</a>.</p>
