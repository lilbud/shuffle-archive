<p>Twenty-year-old Grace Gaustad has been a Springsteen fan all her life, and her new single proves it.</p>
<p>Released just last week, her cover of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/08/21/roll-of-the-dice-pink-cadillac/">Pink Cadillac</a>” is the first cut from her upcoming <em>JUKEBX</em> EP, and you could almost call it a duet–because Gaustad shares the vocals with <em>her ten-year-old self</em>.</p>
<p>Gaustad has been performing and recording since she was a kid. In an interview with <em>Los Angeles Confidential, </em>the L.A.-based singer-songwriter revealed that “a couple times a year, [my mom and I get on our phones, get on our computers, and we go searching for old demos, old recordings… we have just an abundance of different recordings and funny things that I did as a kid. And so more recently, we came across this cover of ‘Pink Cadillac.’ We played it and were like, ‘Wow, this is actually pretty good.'”</p>
<p>Rather than simply re-record it, she decided to sing it in the same key as her ten-year-old self and combine the vocals into a single track. The end result? “[H]earing those two vocals against one another is like magic. It’s so cool… very surreal.”</p>

<p>Gaustad gravitated to Bruce’s music through her mom’s influence. What attracted Gaustad to “Pink Cadillac” in particular? “Probably because I was 10 years old and loved the color pink.” Maybe that’s all it took when she was ten, but it’s pretty clear from the video that at age twenty, Gaustad has a better sense of what Bruce’s song is about.</p>
