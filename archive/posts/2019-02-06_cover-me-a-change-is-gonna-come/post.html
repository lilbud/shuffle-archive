In fact, he never even got to see how influential his song became, because he died mere days before the single was released (oddly, as a B-side to “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/04/15/cover-me-shake/">Shake</a>“).</p>
<p>Intensely and intimately autobiographical, Cooke’s song was a marked departure for the romantic soul singer, but after experiencing acts of racism repeatedly, he was compelled to write about it. Born from first hand experience, the song came naturally, with lush orchestration that builds throughout the song and conveys a sense of determination that will not be denied.</p>

<p>Cooke recorded “A Change Is Gonna Come” in January 1964 and released it on album in March. But despite an early performance on The Tonight Show, Cooke refused to play it live in public. The song sounded like a prediction to him, but also like a premonition–one as full of danger as of destiny.</p>
<p>Cooke finally decided to release the song as a single in December 1964, only to be murdered by the manager of a Los Angeles hotel eleven days before its release.  The song became a posthumous hit for Cooke, peaking at #31 on the Billboard Hot 100, and it became anthem for the Civil Rights movement in America ever since.</p>
<p>Given how much of his artistic and political energy he’s devoted to civil rights, It’s somewhat surprising that Bruce has never covered “A Change Is Gonna Come” in concert.</p>
<p>He did, however, soundcheck it once–at The Omni in Atlanta, on March 22, 1988. And unlike most of the rare soundcheck recordings we’re lucky enough to have captured, this one is quite clean and clear.</p>
<p>Listen to Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band (featuring stunningly soaring vocals from Bruce and soulful accompaniment from Clarence) play “A Change Is Gonna Come” in an arena empty of bodies but full of spirit:</p>
