This may be the first Springsteen cover to feature the nyckelharpa (at least the first one that I’m aware of), and it’s beautiful.

Alexander and Willms and Stefan Antheck collaborate on a series of wonderful covers of classic songs (not just Bruce’s, although they cover a few of his). This is my favorite though–their cover of “[Something in the Night](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/05/28/roll-of-the-dice-something-in-the-night/)” perfectly preserves the song’s lonely, late night ambiance while bringing something fresh and new to it.

Take a listen below.
