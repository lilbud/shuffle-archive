<p>This may be the first Springsteen cover to feature the nyckelharpa (at least the first one that I’m aware of), and it’s beautiful.</p>
<p>Alexander and Willms and Stefan Antheck collaborate on a series of wonderful covers of classic songs (not just Bruce’s, although they cover a few of his). This is my favorite though–their cover of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/05/28/roll-of-the-dice-something-in-the-night/">Something in the Night</a>” perfectly preserves the song’s lonely, late night ambiance while bringing something fresh and new to it.</p>
<p>Take a listen below.</p>
