<p>The event was a hometown celebration of Dr. John’s music during Jazz Fest in New Orleans in 2014.</p>
<p>With a line-up of guests ranging from The Blind Boys of Alabama and The Neville Brothers to Jason Isbell and Widespread Panic, who could qualify as “special” enough to open the night with Dr. John’s greatest hit? (“Right Place, Wrong Time peaked at #9 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1973.)</p>

<p>(Hint: this blog is about him.)</p>
<p>When the curtain rose, Bruce Springsteen surprised the crowd (okay, maybe they weren’t <em>too</em> surprised, since Bruce had played a set at Jazz Fest earlier that day) by teaming up with the original artist on a terrific rendition of “Right Place, Wrong Time” — and fortunately for all of us, their performance was captured for an official video release.</p>

<p>That wasn’t the first time Bruce shared a stage with Dr. John, but it would turn out to be the last. The New Orleans legend passed away five years later.</p>
