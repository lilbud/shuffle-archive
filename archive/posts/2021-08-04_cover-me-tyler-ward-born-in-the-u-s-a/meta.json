As of this writing, he has more than two million YouTube subscribers&#8211;40% more than Bruce can claim, by the way&#8211;and over five\u00a0<em>billion</em> lifetime views.</p>\n<p>Yet even though he&#8217;s been releasing online content constantly for more than a dozen years, it wasn&#8217;t until a few weeks ago that he covered Bruce Springsteen.</p>\n<p>On Independence Day, Tyler released a cover of &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/09/21/roll-of-the-dice-born-in-the-u-s-a/\">Born in the U.S.A.,</a>&#8221; and with as many followers as he has, it didn&#8217;t need to be good to get attention.</p>\n<p>But holy moly, this is a <em>damn</em> good cover&#8211;vibrant yet poignant, simmering and seething with carefully contained emotion until it just explodes with anguish and protest.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Born in the U.S.A. - Bruce Springsteen (Cover By Tyler Ward) - AUDIO ONLY\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/We1BzUZCeJQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Ordinarily, I&#8217;d say that Ward doesn&#8217;t need promotion from a little blog like mine.
