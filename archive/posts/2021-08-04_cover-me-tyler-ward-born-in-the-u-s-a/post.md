If you’re of a certain age (like me), the idea of discovering new music through a video streaming service is probably a fairly new one, and the name Tyler Ward probably doesn’t ring a bell.

But for those savvy enough to flock to YouTube in its early years, Tyler Ward is an O.G. superstar.

Ward has been building an online following since 2008, through a steady stream of original music and creative covers. As of this writing, he has more than two million YouTube subscribers–40% more than Bruce can claim, by the way–and over five *billion* lifetime views.

Yet even though he’s been releasing online content constantly for more than a dozen years, it wasn’t until a few weeks ago that he covered Bruce Springsteen.

On Independence Day, Tyler released a cover of “[Born in the U.S.A.,](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/09/21/roll-of-the-dice-born-in-the-u-s-a/)” and with as many followers as he has, it didn’t need to be good to get attention.

But holy moly, this is a *damn* good cover–vibrant yet poignant, simmering and seething with carefully contained emotion until it just explodes with anguish and protest.

Ordinarily, I’d say that Ward doesn’t need promotion from a little blog like mine. But I suspect Springsteen fans aren’t in his target demographic, because compared with his most popular videos, Ward’s version of “Born in the U.S.A.” is an absolute sleeper with only 8,000 or so views.

So do your favorite Springsteen fan a favor and point them toward this wonderful rendition. Tyler Ward’s “Born in the U.S.A.” immediately leaps onto my list of favorite Springsteen covers ever.
