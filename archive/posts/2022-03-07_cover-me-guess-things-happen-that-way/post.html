<p>He was sound-checking with the E Street Band at the Capitol Theater in Passaic before the second of his now-legendary three-show stand on the Darkness Tour, and as usual he was interweaving a handful of rock and country classics with his own material.</p>
<p>Hank Williams had become his soundcheck go-to of late; the intimate setting provided Bruce an opportunity to indulge his own tastes for material that likely wouldn’t win over a packed house. Tonight was no different: he kicked off the rehearsal with “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/02/15/cover-me-wedding-bells/">Wedding Bells</a>” and tinkered with “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/05/02/cover-me-i-cant-help-it-if-im-still-in-love-with-you/">I Can’t Help It (If I’m Still in Love With You)</a>” and “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/12/07/cover-me-i-heard-that-lonesome-whistle/">(I Heard That) Lonesome Whistle</a>” as well.</p>
<p>But in the middle of the session, he dialed up a double-shot of The Man in Black. Bruce would cover the latter of the pair (“<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/06/16/cover-me-i-walk-the-line/">I Walk the Line</a>“) in concert following Cash’s death decades later. The former, however, was a one-time-only affair.</p>
<p>“Guess Things Happen That Way” was one of Cash’s earliest hits–his fourth #1 single on the country chart, a spot it refused to give up for a full eight weeks in 1958.</p>

<p>Bruce took two brief runs through the song on that late summer day, the first in his customary singing voice and the second in a register clearly intended to evoke the original artist. Neither run-through was a full pass through the song, but it was enough for us to get a sense of what Bruce’s cover might have sounded like if he’d played it in full.</p>

<p>“Guess Things Happen That Way” never made it into Bruce’s set list that night or any other. It joins a handful of lost classics only known to us thanks to the efforts of surreptitious bootleggers.</p>
