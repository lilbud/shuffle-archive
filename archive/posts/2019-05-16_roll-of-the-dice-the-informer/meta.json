Bruce was still undecided about the lyrics (wired to every shadow, or every corner? friends or best friends?), and even the title was up in the air&#8211;it appears that the song had two titles under consideration: &#8220;The Informer&#8221; and &#8220;The Mark.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For now, &#8220;The Informer&#8221; remains an enigma.
