<p>Here’s another diamond in the rough from Bruce’s home studio recording sessions in early 1983: a short, tight lament called “Seven Tears.”</p>

<p>In Bruce’s typical “I had a job, I had a girl” fashion (in fact, the first two verses foreshadow two songs that would end up on his next album–“<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/01/22/roll-of-the-dice-downbound-train/">Downbound Train</a>,” and the title track, “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/09/21/roll-of-the-dice-born-in-the-u-s-a/">Born in the U.S.A.</a>“), Bruce neatly and efficiently lays out the story of a man who had it all and lost it all–and now he memorializes his seven years of happiness with a facial tattoo of seven tears as a mark of his everlasting sadness.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>I had a wife, I had a child</em><br/>
<em>I had a home up on a hill</em><br/>
<em>Had a good life for seven years</em><br/>
<em>Now all I’ve got is seven tears</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Went down to see my gypsy man</em><br/>
<em>He said, “Now son, I understand”</em><br/>
<em>When I said, “I want one for every year”</em><br/>
<em>He tattooed on my face these seven tears</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Oh seven tears, oh seven tears</em><br/>
<em>I want one for every happy year</em><br/>
<em>My baby’s gone, she’s gone, gone, gone</em><br/>
<em>And I’ll cry forever ever on</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>When I walk out into the lights of town</em><br/>
<em>People see me coming and they gather round</em><br/>
<em>They wanna know how I ended up here</em><br/>
<em>With this tattoo on my face of seven tears</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Oh seven tears, oh seven tears</em><br/>
<em>I want one for every happy year</em><br/>
<em>My baby’s gone, she’s gone, gone, gone</em><br/>
<em>And I’ll cry forever ever on</em></p>
<p>By showing his sorrow on the outside, he prompts the people he encounters to ask him what’s behind it. And that’s precisely by design: our narrator’s punishment is his penitence. Unable to forgive himself or move on, he ensures that he’s forced to relive his love and retell his loss every day.</p>
<p>Musically, Bruce slowed and recycled the melody he used for “Little Girl Like You” a few weeks earlier. Lyrically, however, “Seven Tears” is a masterful example of economy in songwriting. Both “Little Girl Like You” and “Seven Tears” are about ninety seconds long, but whereas the former is a lazy trifle, the latter is a complete tale with an emotional wallop.</p>
<p>It deserves its official release on <em>L.A. Garage Sessions ’83.</em></p>
