(There may be a reason for that: Bruce&#8217;s first known performance of the song comes only weeks into his eponymous band&#8217;s existence, so he may have had that one at the ready prior to his new group&#8217;s formation.</p>\n<p>It certainly follows the Steel Mill formula, though: light on lyrics, heavy on guitar solos, and arrangements that stretch on seemingly forever. In fact, modern-day Bruce edited out three verses (a full minute and a half) from the released version above, seemingly recognizing that perhaps the song stretched on just a bit too long.</p>\n<p>(We&#8217;re not missing anything though, because those three verses are actually repeated in full after the mid-song jam. Bruce left the second occurrences in the song, so while it&#8217;s significantly shorter, it&#8217;s still content complete. Compare with the unedited bootleg version below and see for yourself.)</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Ballad of Jeese James - The Bruce Springsteen Band aka Don\u00b4t you want to be an outlaw?\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/myE7hMcbpNg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>As for those lyrics, there&#8217;s not much to analyze. &#8220;The Ballad of Jesse James&#8221; is the credo of a young rocker, an exhortation to rebel, revel, and relish all that life has to offer while you&#8217;re young enough to appreciate it.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well don&#8217;t you wanna climb a mountain</em><br />\n<em>Yeah don&#8217;t you wanna ride the river</em><br />\n<em>Drink from a magic fountain</em><br />\n<em>Give your woman all the love that you can give her</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well don&#8217;t you wanna be an outlaw</em><br />\n<em>Don&#8217;t you wanna ride the range</em><br />\n<em>Don&#8217;t you wanna be an outlaw, children</em><br />\n<em>Just like Jesse, like Jesse James, just like Jesse boy</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well now don&#8217;t you wanna swim the ocean</em><br />\n<em>Yeah don&#8217;t you wanna climb the highest tree</em><br />\n<em>Drink some of Mama&#8217;s love potion</em><br />\n<em>Kiss your woman till she just can&#8217;t see</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Don&#8217;t you wanna be an outlaw, yeah baby</em><br />\n<em>Just a poor boy caught on the skids</em><br />\n<em>Don&#8217;t you wanna be an outlaw, children</em><br />\n<em>Just like Billy, just like Billy the Kid</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Yeah Jesse he was a bad boy</em><br />\n<em>He roamed the wild west</em><br />\n<em>And many notches on his gun as the year of 21</em><br />\n<em>Someone laid him to an early rest</em><br />\n<em>All right, baby</em></p>\n<p>If there&#8217;s any nuance to be found in &#8220;The Ballad of Jesse James,&#8221; it&#8217;s in that pivotal verse above. It&#8217;s a cautionary tale, but one that can be read two ways: a <em>carpe diem</em> call to action lest life cut your opportunity short before you&#8217;re ready; or a warning that living and loving with abandon can\u00a0 hasten that end.</p>\n<p>Either way, in my opinion it&#8217;s not enough to elevate &#8220;The Ballad of Jesse James&#8221; to a release-worthy Bruce Springsteen Band recording.</p>\n<p>Bruce could have given us the light-on-its feet &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/05/23/roll-of-the-dice-im-in-love-again/\">I&#8217;m in Love Again</a>,&#8221; the Van Morrison-esque &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/05/19/roll-of-the-dice-natural-magic/\">Natural Magic</a>,&#8221; or the lovely, lonely &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/02/03/roll-of-the-dice-shes-leaving/\">She&#8217;s Leaving</a>.&#8221; Maybe someday he still will.</p>\n<p>But for now we have &#8220;The Ballad of Jesse James,&#8221; and it seems like that wasn&#8217;t a choice Bruce made lightly. In April 2017, the core of the Bruce Springsteen Band reunited alongside a host of additional Asbury Park musical legends.</p>\n<p>This mighty one-time-only &#8220;Upstage Jam Band&#8221; tore through a set list of classic rock covers and a pair of Springsteen originals: &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/10/04/roll-of-the-dice-the-fever/\">The Fever</a>&#8221; (a lock, given the presence of Southside Johnny) and &#8220;The Ballad of Jesse James.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s that performance&#8211;its first in 46 years&#8211;performed by the original Bruce Springsteen Band line-up of Bruce, David Sancious, Garry Tallent, Steve Van Zandt, and (in a curve ball) Vini Lopez on lead vocals.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Ballad of Jesse James\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IJ-MMNnX_AE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><strong>The Ballad of Jesse James<br />\nRecorded:</strong> March 14, 1972<br />\n<strong>Released:\u00a0</strong><em>Chapter and Verse\u00a0</em>(2016)<br />\n<strong>First performed:</strong> September 1, 1971 (Long Branch, NJ)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> April 21, 2017 (Asbury Park, NJ)</p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
