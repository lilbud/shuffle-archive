<p>Today’s covered-by-Bruce entry is certainly an unlikely one:</p>
<p>Sure, “Sentimental Journey” was a number one hit for Doris Day in 1945 and spent a remarkable 23 weeks on the charts. But it was a mellow big band standard, more likely to be covered by fellow New Jerseyan Frank Sinatra (who did in fact cover it, of course) than Bruce Springsteen.</p>

<p>And yet cover it he did, with the E Street Band during a radio station appearance forty-five years ago–so early that the band didn’t even have their name yet.</p>
<p>From March 9, 1974 at Station KLOL-FM in Houston, in crystal clarity, here’s Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band’s one and only performance of “Sentimental Journey.”*</p>

<p>*There is a surviving but undated setlist from Bruce’s high school days with The Castiles that indicates he may have played “Sentimental Journey” at a wedding in 1965 (Bruce would have <em>just</em> turned sixteen), but it cannot be definitively dated and no recording exists.</p>
