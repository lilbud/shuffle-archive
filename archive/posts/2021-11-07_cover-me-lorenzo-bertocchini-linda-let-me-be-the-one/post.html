<p>But I find myself making an exception for Lorenzo Bertocchini, who makes his third appearance here on the Shuffle today (although one was for his original “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/04/21/spare-parts-lorenzo-bertocchini-hey-bruce/">Hey Bruce</a>” composition).</p>
<p>Today’s cover comes from Lorenzo’s 2009 tribute album, <em>Hearts of Stone</em>, and one look at the <a href="https://www.rockit.it/lorenzobertocchinietheapplepir/album/hearts-of-stone-some-bruce-springsteen-songs/18929">tracklist</a> (which includes deep cuts like “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/11/23/roll-of-the-dice-ricky-wants-a-man-of-her-own/">Ricky Wants a Man of Her Own</a>,” “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/08/03/roll-of-the-dice-cindy/">Cindy</a>,” and “Sugarland”) tells you that this is a production of a true and deep fan.</p>
<p>Today, we’ll listen to my favorite track on the album, Lorenzo’s beautiful interpretation of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/03/27/roll-of-the-dice-linda-let-me-be-the-one/">Linda Let Me Be The One</a>.”</p>

<p>Lorenzo strips away the Spectorian production of Bruce’s original, but he manages to retain all the romance via a beautifully arranged acoustic band performance.</p>
<p>Interestingly, he’s clearly inspired by the bootleg outtake that circulated for years before Bruce finally released a finished cut on <em>Tracks</em> in 1998–we can tell from his use of the distinctive “Linda will you <em>heyyyyyy</em> let me be the one” hallmark of the bootleg track.</p>
<p>Tribute albums can be hit or miss, and I generally don’t make it a practice to recommend them. In this instance, though, I have no reservations. Check out <em>Hearts of Stone</em>, and you won’t be disappointed, and for more of Lorenzo’s great Springsteen covers, see <a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/12/09/cover-me-lorenzo-bertocchini-and-elizabeth-lee-be-true/">his wonderful duet with Elizabeth Lee</a> on “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/12/02/roll-of-the-dice-be-true/">Be True</a>.”</p>
