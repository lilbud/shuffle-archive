I try not to revisit cover artists very often, because there are so many great Springsteen covers out there by performers who deserve more visibility and airplay.

But I find myself making an exception for Lorenzo Bertocchini, who makes his third appearance here on the Shuffle today (although one was for his original "[Hey Bruce](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/04/21/spare-parts-lorenzo-bertocchini-hey-bruce/)" composition).

Today's cover comes from Lorenzo's 2009 tribute album, *Hearts of Stone*, and one look at the [tracklist](https://www.rockit.it/lorenzobertocchinietheapplepir/album/hearts-of-stone-some-bruce-springsteen-songs/18929) (which includes deep cuts like "[Ricky Wants a Man of Her Own](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/11/23/roll-of-the-dice-ricky-wants-a-man-of-her-own/)," "[Cindy](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/08/03/roll-of-the-dice-cindy/)," and "Sugarland") tells you that this is a production of a true and deep fan.

Today, we'll listen to my favorite track on the album, Lorenzo's beautiful interpretation of "[Linda Let Me Be The One](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/03/27/roll-of-the-dice-linda-let-me-be-the-one/)."

Lorenzo strips away the Spectorian production of Bruce's original, but he manages to retain all the romance via a beautifully arranged acoustic band performance.

Interestingly, he's clearly inspired by the bootleg outtake that circulated for years before Bruce finally released a finished cut on *Tracks* in 1998–we can tell from his use of the distinctive "Linda will you *heyyyyyy* let me be the one" hallmark of the bootleg track.

Tribute albums can be hit or miss, and I generally don't make it a practice to recommend them. In this instance, though, I have no reservations. Check out *Hearts of Stone*, and you won't be disappointed, and for more of Lorenzo's great Springsteen covers, see [his wonderful duet with Elizabeth Lee](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/12/09/cover-me-lorenzo-bertocchini-and-elizabeth-lee-be-true/) on "[Be True](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/12/02/roll-of-the-dice-be-true/)."
