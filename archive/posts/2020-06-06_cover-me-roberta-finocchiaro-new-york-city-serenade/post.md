Italian singer-songwriter Roberta Finocchiaro (you might have caught her in her Light of Day appearances) just dropped her new album, and it’s terrific. Check it out or on your favorite music streaming service.

But this morning, it’s her fantastic cover of “New York City Serenade” that has me grooving.

“New York City Serenade” is a difficult song to cover, which is probably why so few artists have tried. Roberta plays to her strengths by arranging the song for solo electric guitar, and it translates perfectly.

Filmed in her sun-drenched backyard, her performance of “New York City Serenade” is the perfect way to start off a lazy weekend morning.
