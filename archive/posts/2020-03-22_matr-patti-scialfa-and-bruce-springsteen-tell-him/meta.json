Given how special that song must be to them, you&#8217;d think we could practically trip over recordings of Bruce and Patti performing it together.</p>\n<p>But even though they&#8217;re known to have performed it a dozen times together in the 21st century, it&#8217;s pretty tough to find a recording of even one of them. That&#8217;s because almost every single one of those times was at a private benefit concert&#8211;either for the Rumson Country Day School and the Ranney School (where their kids attended), or Boston College (Evan&#8217;s alma mater). Once they even sang it at a wedding.</p>\n<p>In fact the only performance of those dozen that was open to the public was their holiday show at Harry&#8217;s Roadhouse in Asbury Park on December 19, 2004. At the late show that night, Bruce and Patti finally performed the song that changed their lives in public. Take a listen below&#8211;you&#8217;ll hear Patti on lead vocals, Bruce on backing vocals.</p>\n<div id=\"v-biU0S8St-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='426' src='https://videopress.com/embed/biU0S8St?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>As for the original version of &#8220;Tell Him,&#8221; Bruce was technically correct in crediting The Exciters&#8211;they took the song all the way to #4 on the Billboard Hot 100 in early 1963.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"The Exciters - Tell Him\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/G2sH6h0ViDg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>But the song actually dates back a little earlier under a slightly different name. In 1962, months before The Exciters released their version, Gil Hamilton first recorded the song as &#8220;Tell Her.&#8221; Other than the flipped gender, the lyrics are identical, but The Exciters&#8217; version is far more, well, exciting.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"1st RECORDING OF: Tell Him (as \u2018Tell Her\u2019) - Gil Hamilton (1962)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9l06SeU48CE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>And as for that fateful performance back in 1984&#8230; well, nothing came of it that night.
