<p>One of my favorite things about writing this blog is coming across new Springsteen covers on an almost daily basis.</p>
<p>And while it’s the well-known ones by big-name artists that drive the most traffic and conversation, I often find myself taken by obscure ones by artists I’ve never heard before.</p>
<p>Case in point: this lovely acoustic version of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/12/21/roll-of-the-dice-hungry-heart/">Hungry Heart</a>” by Finnish duo The Lovematches.</p>
<p>Filmed in a beautiful location to frame their gorgeous harmonies, guitar, and accordion, this is a wonderful track for a quiet weekend morning.</p>
