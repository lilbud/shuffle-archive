So for this show at the Mohegan Sun Cas<span class="text_exposed_show">ino(!) in Uncasville, CT (certainly one of the most unusual venues I’ve seen Bruce play)–the penultimate show of the High Hopes tour–I’ll go with… jaw-dropping-est.</span></p>
<div class="text_exposed_show">
<p>Because there’s just no way I could have predicted:</p>
<p>* opening with the debut of the outtake (“’78” version) of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/10/03/roll-of-the-dice-racing-in-the-street/">Racing in the Street</a>.” (Sort of, anyway–after so many years of performing the released version, he had a really hard time sticking to the outtake arrangement and basically ended up with a hybrid.)</p>

<p>* a mid-set 1970s encore throwback of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/05/21/cover-me-raise-your-hand/">Raise Your Hand</a>” and “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/08/21/cover-me-quarter-to-three/">Quarter to Three</a>.”</p>

<p>* Covers of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/09/10/cover-me-clampdown/">Clampdown</a>” by The Clash and “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/09/01/cover-me-stayin-alive/">Stayin’ Alive</a>” by The Bee Gees (both of which rocked).</p>

<p>* The dream triple-play of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/09/07/roll-of-the-dice-hearts-of-stone/">Hearts of Stone</a>” (the second E Street Band performance ever), “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/02/26/roll-of-the-dice-talk-to-me/">Talk to Me</a>” (ninth ever)  and “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/09/23/roll-of-the-dice-the-price-you-pay/">The Price You Pay</a>” (only the fourth time since 1981), along with the fourth-ever outing for “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/02/12/roll-of-the-dice-frankie-fell-in-love/">Frankie Fell in Love</a>.”</p>

<p>* the welcome return of prodigals like “American Skin (41 Shots),” “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/08/01/roll-of-the-dice-radio-nowhere/">Radio Nowhere</a>,” and Steve Van Zandt, who flew home from Norway for the tour-closing stand.</p>

<p>* <em>four</em> acoustic songs in the encore (“<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/02/14/roll-of-the-dice-ill-work-for-your-love/">I’ll Work for Your Love</a>,” “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/09/29/roll-of-the-dice-growin-up/">Growin’ Up</a>,” “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/06/01/roll-of-the-dice-if-i-should-fall-behind/">If I Should Fall Behind</a>,” and “Thunder Road”)–I’m not sure that’s ever happened before or since on an E Street Band tour.</p>

<p>* one of the very best crowds I’ve ever witnessed–I was expecting a high-roller, casual fan crowd, but this was a seriously hard-core fanbase show, and it seemed to take Bruce a bit by surprise as well.</p>
<p>The most remarkable part? It was only the first night of a two-night final stand. Night One is traditionally a relatively standard set; Night Two is the pull-out-all-the stops, shock-and-awe performance. And it actually was <em>supposed to be</em> a standard set–Bruce ended up calling audibles for <em>twelve </em>of the standards in favor of the wildcards and rarities.</p>
<p>So how in the world would he try to top this show on Night Two? I found out the next night.</p>
