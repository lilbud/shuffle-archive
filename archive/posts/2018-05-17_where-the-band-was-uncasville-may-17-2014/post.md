The problem with seeing a lot of Bruce Springsteen shows is that you tend to run out of superlatives after a while. So for this show at the Mohegan Sun Casino(!) in Uncasville, CT (certainly one of the most unusual venues I’ve seen Bruce play)–the penultimate show of the High Hopes tour–I’ll go with… jaw-dropping-est.

Because there’s just no way I could have predicted:

* opening with the debut of the outtake (“’78” version) of “[Racing in the Street](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/10/03/roll-of-the-dice-racing-in-the-street/).” (Sort of, anyway–after so many years of performing the released version, he had a really hard time sticking to the outtake arrangement and basically ended up with a hybrid.)

* a mid-set 1970s encore throwback of “[Raise Your Hand](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/05/21/cover-me-raise-your-hand/)” and “[Quarter to Three](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/08/21/cover-me-quarter-to-three/).”

* Covers of “[Clampdown](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/09/10/cover-me-clampdown/)” by The Clash and “[Stayin’ Alive](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/09/01/cover-me-stayin-alive/)” by The Bee Gees (both of which rocked).

* The dream triple-play of “[Hearts of Stone](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/09/07/roll-of-the-dice-hearts-of-stone/)” (the second E Street Band performance ever), “[Talk to Me](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/02/26/roll-of-the-dice-talk-to-me/)” (ninth ever) and “[The Price You Pay](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/09/23/roll-of-the-dice-the-price-you-pay/)” (only the fourth time since 1981), along with the fourth-ever outing for “[Frankie Fell in Love](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/02/12/roll-of-the-dice-frankie-fell-in-love/).”

* the welcome return of prodigals like “American Skin (41 Shots),” “[Radio Nowhere](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/08/01/roll-of-the-dice-radio-nowhere/),” and Steve Van Zandt, who flew home from Norway for the tour-closing stand.

* *four* acoustic songs in the encore (“[I’ll Work for Your Love](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/02/14/roll-of-the-dice-ill-work-for-your-love/),” “[Growin’ Up](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/09/29/roll-of-the-dice-growin-up/),” “[If I Should Fall Behind](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/06/01/roll-of-the-dice-if-i-should-fall-behind/),” and “Thunder Road”)–I’m not sure that’s ever happened before or since on an E Street Band tour.

* one of the very best crowds I’ve ever witnessed–I was expecting a high-roller, casual fan crowd, but this was a seriously hard-core fanbase show, and it seemed to take Bruce a bit by surprise as well.

The most remarkable part? It was only the first night of a two-night final stand. Night One is traditionally a relatively standard set; Night Two is the pull-out-all-the stops, shock-and-awe performance. And it actually was *supposed to be* a standard set–Bruce ended up calling audibles for *twelve* of the standards in favor of the wildcards and rarities.

So how in the world would he try to top this show on Night Two? I found out the next night.
