In 2015, indie/folk/Americana trio Found Wandering recorded a live EP of covers in the living room of Sarah and Colin Comstock (two members of the trio).

Called (appropriately) *The Living Room Sessions*, the EP features a gorgeous Springsteen cover amongst a good company of songs written by Tom Waits, Bob Dylan, and more.

It’s well worth picking up, but for the moment, enjoy the band’s spirited cover of “[I’m on Fire](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/09/11/roll-of-the-dice-im-on-fire/).”
