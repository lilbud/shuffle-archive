<p>In 2015, indie/folk/Americana trio Found Wandering recorded a live EP of covers in the living room of Sarah and Colin Comstock (two members of the trio).</p>
<p>Called (appropriately) <em>The Living Room Sessions</em>, the EP features a gorgeous Springsteen cover amongst a good company of songs written by Tom Waits, Bob Dylan, and more.</p>
<p>It’s well worth picking up, but for the moment, enjoy the band’s spirited cover of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/09/11/roll-of-the-dice-im-on-fire/">I’m on Fire</a>.”</p>
