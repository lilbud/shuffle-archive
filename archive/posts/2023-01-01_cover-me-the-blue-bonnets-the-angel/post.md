meta-description: It’s an obscure song covered by an even more obscure band, but The Blue Bonnets’ version of “The Angel” is terrific–maybe even better than Bruce’s version.

I don’t know much about The Blue Bonnets other than that they contributed to the excellent Italian tribute album back in 1995.

*For You*

But their contribution wasn’t just another of the countless “” or “” renditions out there… these guys get serious bonus points for digging in Bruce’s catalog and selecting a song that almost no one ever touches: “,” from Bruce’s very first album.

[I’m on Fire](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/09/11/roll-of-the-dice-im-on-fire/)[Dancing in the Dark](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/12/25/roll-of-the-dice-dancing-in-the-dark/)*deep*[The Angel](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/09/26/roll-of-the-dice-the-angel/)

Not many fans would rank “” very high in Bruce’s catalog, but if Bruce had arranged the song like the Blue Bonnets did, I bet a whole lot more would. Take a listen:

That’s a seriously good arrangement and performance–so much so that it I wish Bruce would give it a go in concert next time around.

If anyone has any other information about this band, I’d love to know.
