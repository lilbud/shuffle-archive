I feel like I should remember more of this show than I do.

After all, it was only two years ago, it was the longest show Bruce ever played in the US, and the second longest anywhere (at the time, anyway–that record fell repeatedly over the course of a few weeks).

Plus, I got to hear “New York City Serenade” with strings open the show yet again (I couldn’t believe it was my third time hearing it in under six weeks), along with that beautiful new arrangement of “.”

Also, Tom Morello guest-starred on four songs, including an absolutely searing “American Skin (41 Shots)” and the obligatory “.”

And while the show may not have had any tour premieres, there were some genuine gems strewn through the setlist, including powerful performances of “” and “.”

The crowd was even louder and rowdier than at Tuesday’s show, singing along to every song, and the band was in even finer form.

…and then there was that gorgeous “My City of Ruins,” dedicated to the victims of the Italian earthquake earlier that week, with a galvanizing mid-song pep talk on resilience from Coach Springsteen. I can’t count the number of times I’ve seen Bruce perform this song, but I can count the number of times it’s been this powerful: one.

But I could never fully focus my attention on the show, because the two rows in front of me were full of Bruce’s extended family–his mom, sister, and (I presume) his various nieces, nephews, cousins, etc.–and during any given song, there was always some combination of them going from their seats to backstage or vice versa (we were seated directly side-stage), and it proved distracting (and frankly, a bit annoying until I figured out who they were. For the first half of the show, I thought they were just rude VIP fans.).

Every time a group of the kids went down to the floor, some “fans” would nonchalantly walk over and take their excellent seats… for about thirty seconds, which is what it took for security to come running over. It was funny to watch them proclaim their innocence and swear that these were their own seats, having no idea that they picked the worst seats in the house to try to steal. Funny the first time, anyway. By the fourth time, it was just annoying.

Bruce’s mom never left her seat, though. She rarely sat in it either–for a ninety-something, she put most Bruce fans to shame. She danced, sang and knew the correct fan response to pretty much every song.

It was a delight to watch her enjoy her son’s performance, but the whole family reunion playing out in front of me all night long kept me from being as in-the-moment as I usually am at a show.

(And speaking of delights, can we acknowledge for a moment how fantastic this little three-year-old girl is on “?”)

Ultimately, I realized, it was just that kind of night–we didn’t have Intense Bruce, or Party Bruce, or Flying-by-the-seat-of-his-pants Bruce. We just had Family Bruce, and he was clearly happy to be in his home state, surrounded by friends and family and just allowing himself to enjoy himself on-stage. He looked happy all night long, and that was nice to see.

And there couldn’t have been a more fitting way to end it than how it spontaneously played out: with a show-closing “,” and the marriage proposal that completely stopped it in its tracks at the stroke of midnight. Patti saw it first, then the band, and finally Bruce. And what happened next is magic. Take a moment and watch it, even if you’ve seen it before. This part I remember vividly.

Yeah… it was just that kind of night. Years from now I may not remember much about the performances that night, but I’m sure I’ll still remember how it felt to be there. I didn’t go the show with anyone, but it felt like I was surrounded by family.
