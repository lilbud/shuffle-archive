For the first half of the show, I thought they were just rude VIP fans.).</p>\n<p>Every time a group of the kids went down to the floor, some &#8220;fans&#8221; would nonchalantly walk over and take their excellent seats&#8230; for about thirty seconds, which is what it took for security to come running over. It was funny to watch them proclaim their innocence and swear that these were their own seats, having no idea that they picked the worst seats in the house to try to steal. Funny the first time, anyway. By the fourth time, it was just annoying.</p>\n<p>Bruce&#8217;s mom never left her seat, though. She rarely sat in it either&#8211;for a ninety-something, she put most Bruce fans to shame. She danced, sang and knew the correct fan response to pretty much every song.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Adele Springsteen Rockin At Met Life August 25 2016\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6Up9-iLTbmE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>It was a delight to watch her enjoy her son&#8217;s performance, but the whole family reunion playing out in front of me all night long kept me from being as in-the-moment as I usually am at a show.</p>\n<p>(And speaking of delights, can we acknowledge for a moment how fantastic this little three-year-old girl is on &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/09/27/roll-of-the-dice-waitin-on-a-sunny-day/\">Waitin&#8217; on a Sunny Day</a>?&#8221;)</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Waitin&#039; on a sunny day - Aug 25, 2016 - Metlife - Subtitulado\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tREa6yUd_Ec?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Ultimately, I realized, it was just that kind of night&#8211;we didn&#8217;t have Intense Bruce, or Party Bruce, or Flying-by-the-seat-of-his-pants Bruce. We just had Family Bruce, and he was clearly happy to be in his home state, surrounded by friends and family and just allowing himself to enjoy himself on-stage. He looked happy all night long, and that was nice to see.</p>\n<p>And there couldn&#8217;t have been a more fitting way to end it than how it spontaneously played out: with a show-closing &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/07/24/cover-me-roll-of-the-dice-jersey-girl/\">Jersey Girl</a>,&#8221; and the marriage proposal that completely stopped it in its tracks at the stroke of midnight. Patti saw it first, then the band, and finally Bruce. And what happened next is magic. Take a moment and watch it, even if you&#8217;ve seen it before.
