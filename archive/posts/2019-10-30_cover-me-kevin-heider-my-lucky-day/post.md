Singer-songwriter Kevin Heider has a brand-new Springsteen tribute album out.

Called *Ohio* (I see what you did there, Kevin), the album features ten acoustic covers. Some are familiar arrangements, others are new, but all are beautiful renditions.

But my favorite track on the album is undoubtedly Kevin’s cover of “[My Lucky Day](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/09/02/roll-of-the-dice-my-lucky-day/),” because not only is it a beautiful cover of a great song, there’s also an accompanying video featuring toddlers on a slide.

C’mon, how great is that?
