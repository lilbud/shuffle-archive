<p>Singer-songwriter Kevin Heider has a brand-new Springsteen tribute album out.</p>
<p>Called <em>Ohio</em> (I see what you did there, Kevin), the album features ten acoustic covers. Some are familiar arrangements, others are new, but all are beautiful renditions.</p>
<p>But my favorite track on the album is undoubtedly Kevin’s cover of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/09/02/roll-of-the-dice-my-lucky-day/">My Lucky Day</a>,” because not only is it a beautiful cover of a great song, there’s also an accompanying video featuring toddlers on a slide.</p>
<p>C’mon, how great is that?</p>
