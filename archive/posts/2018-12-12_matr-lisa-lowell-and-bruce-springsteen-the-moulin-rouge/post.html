<p>Lisa Lowell is familiar name to E Street Nation. Her vocals can be found all over Bruce’s nineties-forward catalog (“<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/03/17/roll-of-the-dice-better-days/">Better Days</a>,” “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/09/06/roll-of-the-dice-across-the-border/">Across the Border</a>,” and “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/01/05/roll-of-the-dice-land-of-hope-and-dreams/">Land of Hope and Dreams</a>” to name but a few), and she was a featured background singer on the Seeger Sessions Tour.</p>
<p>After Lisa lent her support to a cool dozen of Bruce’s released tracks (plus three of Patti’s), Bruce decided to return the favor, playing electric guitar on her sultry track “The Moulin Rouge” on Lisa’s <em>Beautiful Behavior </em>album.</p>

<p>Written in the 1980s (which explains the Billy Idol reference) when her band Venus Flytrap (which included E Streeter Soozie Tyrell) had an extended stay in Paris, “The Moulin Rouge” exudes sex, and Bruce’s tight, restrained guitar work helps keep the heat on high.</p>
<p>Too bad they’ve never performed it together live.</p>
