<p>We’re going obscure today.</p>
<p>I mean <em>seriously</em> obscure: we’re going to listen to a Springsteen cover of a one-hit wonder, and this isn’t even the one hit. And Bruce never officially covered it–he only sound checked it. Once.</p>
<p>Thomas Wayne was only eighteen when he released “You’re The One That Done It” in 1958.</p>

<p>It never charted, but the rockabilly single (written by Raymond Scott) captured the attention of enough young artists to inspire a few also-under-the-radar covers over the years.</p>
<p>If he wasn’t already aware of the original, the one most likely to have caught Bruce’s attention is The Inmates’ cover version from their debut album, <em>First Offence</em>, which (barely) made the U.S. Top 40 on its release in 1979. But even then, “You’re The One That Done It” wasn’t a single–it was buried deep in the album.</p>

<p>However it came to Bruce’s attention, it lodged deep enough in his brain for it to re-surface in 1988 at his sound check with the E Street Band in Atlanta.</p>
<p>Bruce had a penchant for pulling out eclectic mixes of favorite oldies during sound checks on that tour, and occasionally a well-placed fan was able to capture them. (Thanks, Chris!)</p>
<p>Much of the time, those performances were just snippets or frequently interrupted for tuning or adjusting, but this one is complete and features a terrific seat-of-their-pants E Street Band jam.</p>
<p>Take a listen to this delightful one-off cover of an early rockabilly shoulda-been-a-hit single.</p>
