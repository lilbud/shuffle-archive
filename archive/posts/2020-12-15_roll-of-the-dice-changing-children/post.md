meta-description: At the dawn of the 1970s, even Bruce couldn’t help but be a little cynical about the likelihood of real change. Take a listen to his sarcastic Steel Mill song, “Change It.”

I suppose a warning might be appropriate here: If you enjoy picturing Bruce Springsteen as a lifelong idealist, you might not want to listen to his (very) early composition, “Change It.”

Written and performed during his Steel Mill era, “Change It” (which I’ve also seen referred to as “Changing Children” on and based on what I believe is a mis-hearing of the lyrics–in fairness, we don’t have any published “official” lyrics from these early songs to work from) is a blisteringly cynical song.

Composed at the height of student activism, Bruce seems to have completely (if temporarily) washed his hands of the whole notion of protest, resistance, and social movements in general.

Let’s take a listen.

On the surface, “Change It” is fairly typical of Bruce’s material at that time: it serves as a guitar showcase, and it features young Bruce and the band’s new vocalist Robbin Thompson trading off vocals. But when you listen to the lyrics, what seems at first like a contemporary protest song soon reveals itself to be anything but.

*Well everybody’s saying their favorite sayings*  
*Everybody’s singing their favorite songs*  
*Everybody’s got a favorite game they’re playing*  
*We’re alright, but I guess we’re all wrong*



*I said you better take a look around you brother*  
*Something’s happening here*  
*Sooner or later it’s gonna surround you*  
*And leave you with nothing but fear*



*All you gotta do is hang around*  
*Tell you you’re never gonna know*  
*Just what’s going down*

Go back and listen to (or simply read) that second verse again–it’s a direct reference to Buffalo Springfield’s already-classic protest song “.”

Not only does Bruce quote the song directly in the first couplet, he co-opts the song’s rhymes for the chorus that follows as well (around/down vs. sound/down).

If “For What It’s Worth” is a clarion call to action, however, “Change It” is a big fat “why bother?”

Although the band’s vocalists put everything they have into the song’s “Change it, children” refrain (I’m positive it’s not “changing children,” although I can understand how some might hear that), the song progress from subtle to shockingly over cynicism as with each verse.

(If you’re listening to the live recording above, I should point out that Bruce’s entire “Well, I know that we all wanna change it, but first we gotta re-arrange it” verse is an ad lib. I assume that there were some tall folks hogging whatever served as a pit/front-of-stage, and Bruce is gently chiding them to let others see.)

The song continues, poking and prodding at “activists” who are all talk and no action. It’s not that Bruce didn’t believe the protest songs (he written several of them himself by this time)–he was just dismayed that fans would embrace them, sing them, but not live them.

*Well there’s cannons on my left, I got cannons on my right*  
*Rode my people out of battle ’till the sign was right*  
*And you know the only path that’s bringing ’em low now, can’t you see the light*  
*Oh doing what you want to, living life like you like*

At this point, the song tempo awkwardly changes (prompting Bruce to give the audience clapping lessons), abandoning the tropes of classic sixties protest songs and embracing earlier happy-go-lucky rock classics to add an extra note of sarcasm to the lyrics:

*Yeah it’s that time again*  
*I ain’t felt like this since I don’t know when*  
*A new sun is rising and the weather is changing*  
*Whoa whoa it’s revolution*  
*Whoa whoa it’s revolution*



*So lets get together and have a good time*  
*There’s so much fun it’s gonna blow your mind*  
*Break out the guns and the ammo*  
*Everything’s gonna be fine*

(We can clearly hear the influence of The Isley Brothers’ “” in the “it’s that time again, for revolution” chorus at around the 5:20 mark above.)

That middle section culminates with probably the least likely lyrics we’d ever expect to hear from Bruce:

*So take LSD and off the pigs*  
*The summer is over gonna make it big*

At this point, Steel Mill slows the song to a crawl, and Bruce’s vocals become plaintive and sincere:

*almost*



*Everybody’s got a favourite game that they’re playing*  
*Everybody’s right Lord, and huh we’re all wrong*  
*Oh but we can fix that up*  
*We can amend that mistake*  
*Well you know I made a lot of mistakes in my life*  
*Stepped on a few toes too*  
*Well I made a lot of mistakes in my life*  
*The Lord god up above knows that’s true*  
*Changing, we got to change ourselves oh yeah*  
*From all the destruction*  
*From all the corruption*

But only almost. At least in this performance, Bruce and the band walk a fine line–the chorus is a sincere plea, but the verses and vocals show that Bruce has (at least for the moment) given up on the hope that his music will inspire his listeners to act.

That particular super power was still years away.
