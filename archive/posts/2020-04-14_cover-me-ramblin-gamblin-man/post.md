Bob Seger is to Detroit what Bruce Springsteen is to New Jersey, so if you’re catching one of Bruce’s shows in the Motor City area, make sure your set list bingo card has a Seger cover on it–and “Ramblin’ Gamblin’ Man” would be a great place to start.

“Ramblin’ Gamblin’ Man was Seger’s first Top 40 hit (with his original Bob Seger System band), peaking at #17 on the Billboard Hot 100 when it was released all the way back in 1968.

“Ramblin’ Gamblin’ Man” was a reliable staple of Seger’s set list long after the Bob Seger System disbanded, only to disappear in 1983. (It would return a quarter-century or so later.)

Bruce Springsteen didn’t forget about it though. When he rolled into Detroit with his new band in 1992, he included a special encore treat for the local crowd.

“We can’t leave Michigan without some Michigan music!” he wisely remarked, before launching into a terrific cover of Seger’s first big hit. Bruce commented “I don’t know where this man is” at the start and concluded with “We salute you!”–but Seger never heard it, because he was in Los Angeles at the time, working on a new record.

Seventeen years later, Bruce was back in the same building, this time with the E Street Band. If Bruce’s handwritten set list from that night is to be believed, they weren’t planning on paying homage to Mr. Seger that night, but fortunately a fan brought a hand-written sign for the night’s Stump the Band segment that Bruce just couldn’t ignore.

How did the E Street Band rise to the challenge? Watch for yourself:

Although these weren’t the only times Bruce has played “Ramblin’ Gamblin’ Man” (he included it at a few Rising-era Stone Pony gigs as well), they’re the only ones that were captured and circulating for posterity.

But once we make it to the other side of this pandemic, there’s always a strong possibility we’ll hear it again the next time the E Street Band rolls into Detroit.
