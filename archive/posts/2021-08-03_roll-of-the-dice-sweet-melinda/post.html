<p>Bruce’s early band Steel Mill was known for its heavy sound and epic guitar jams, but even the heaviest of sets need to lighten up from time to time.</p>
<p>From late 1969 through their final show in early 1971, the band used “Sweet Melinda,” an early original Springsteen composition, as a mid-set palate cleanser and reprieve for the audience.</p>

<p>Bruce’s “Sweet Melinda” lyrics are more sly and sassy than sweet, and his vocals are deliberately and delightfully drunken and sloppy. The band follows Bruce’s loose lead, strutting and sashaying their way through a performance that evokes nothing so much as closing time at a local dive bar.</p>
<p>As for our heroine, she’s certainly a crowd-pleaser, with a reputation (“All the gang told me”) she seems to live up to when our narrator finds himself fortunate to have his parents’ house to himself. If Bruce had written it in a more modern time, one suspects his narrator would text “You up?”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Sweet, sweet Melinda</em><br/>
<em>You turn my heart to a cinder</em><br/>
<em>The way you do them things that you do</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Oh Melinda</em><br/>
<em>If the Pope knew you were such a sinner</em><br/>
<em>He’d be on his way, flight TWA today</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>I call my baby on the telephone</em><br/>
<em>Come on, my mama’s gone, I’m all alone</em><br/>
<em>Good ol’ Melinda sure can make a man smile</em><br/>
<em>Oh baby, now you’re drivin’ me wild</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Oh sweet, sweet Melinda</em><br/>
<em>You turn my heart to a cinder</em><br/>
<em>The way you do them things that you do</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>I call my woman on the telephone</em><br/>
<em>Come on, my mama’s gone, and I’m alone”</em><br/>
<em>Good ol’ Melinda never leave a man stuck</em><br/>
<em>All the gang told me the way</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Sweet, sweet Melinda</em><br/>
<em>You turn my heart to a cinder</em><br/>
<em>The way you do them things that you do</em></p>
<p>“Sweet Melinda” isn’t a song you’d turn to when asked to typify the Steel Mill sound (let alone Bruce’s later music), but it was a regular feature of their shows throughout their fourteen-month tenure, a lark that offered glimpses of versatility still to come.</p>
