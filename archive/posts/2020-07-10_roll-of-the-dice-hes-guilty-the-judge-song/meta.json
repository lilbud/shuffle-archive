Few of them hold up lyrically when compared to his later solo material, but that&#8217;s because Bruce&#8217;s Steel Mill songs were largely framing devices for the band&#8217;s epic jams that often stretched songs far further than one would ever imagine based on lyrics alone.</p>\n<p>Case in point: &#8220;He&#8217;s Guilty (The Judge Song),&#8221; written in the summer of 1969 and performed steadily throughout the remainder of the Steel Mill era.</p>\n<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s Guilty (The Judge Song)&#8221; is one of the very few songs Steel Mill actually recorded in the studio, more than 50 years ago. Bruce finally released that track&#8211;46 years after it was recorded&#8211;on his 2016 compilation,\u00a0<em>Chapter and Verse.</em></p>\n<p>Take a listen, and you&#8217;ll hear a much showier, cockier Bruce Springsteen tearing it up on guitar (and a pretty darn impressive Danny Federici keyboard solo, too).</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - He&#039;s Guilty (The Judge Song) (2016) [Chapter and Verse]\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8bcFwoMd8wc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>See what I mean? Bruce&#8217;s Steel Mill material is typically more jam than song&#8211;and at only 4:38, that track suggests remarkable restraint on the part of the band.</p>\n<p>But it&#8217;s only a suggestion, because their actual studio performance stretched out much longer&#8211;Bruce edited the track, presumably for time and modern sensibilities. Here&#8217;s the original version of &#8220;He&#8217;s Guilty (The Judge Song)&#8221; in all its glory:</p>\n<div id=\"v-ruLW1gSF-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='568' src='https://videopress.com/embed/ruLW1gSF?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>Lyrically, &#8220;He&#8217;s Guilty (The Judge Song)&#8221; is slight&#8211;there&#8217;s very little to analyze or dissect. That said, there are a few lines worth at least annotating:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>All rise!</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well the judge and the jury came into the courtroom</em><br />\n<em>At about 9:30, the 23rd of June</em></p>\n<p>Even though &#8220;He&#8217;s Guilty (The Judge Song)&#8221; was a staple of the band&#8217;s sets, for some reason Bruce seemed to frequently forget the time of the trial. Sometimes it was 9:30, sometimes 10:30, sometimes both in the same performance. I have no idea whether this was intentional, accidental, or playful, and it probably doesn&#8217;t matter anyway. But it still drives me nuts when I hear it.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Now we&#8217;re here to try this boy for his crime</em><br />\n<em>To see if we set him free or make him serve his time</em><br />\n<em>Jury all got up in the chairs</em><br />\n<em>He&#8217;s guilty, he&#8217;s guilty, send that boy to jail!</em></p>\n<p>Prior to Bruce releasing the song on\u00a0<em>Chapter and Verse</em>, &#8220;He&#8217;s Guilty&#8221; circulated on a few live and studio bootlegs, often under the title &#8220;Send That Boy to Jail&#8221; due to that line&#8217;s prominence in the chorus. Many of Bruce&#8217;s early pre-label songs circulated on bootleg tapes long before fans had any documents to inform official names, so fans often had to invent names based on the lyrics.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Charged with speeding, running down his mother</em><br />\n<em>Oh stabbing his wife and strangling her lover</em><br />\n<em>Well the court is ready to hear your plea</em><br />\n<em>Son, are you guilty or not guilty</em><br />\n<em>Jury all got up to hear his plea</em><br />\n<em>He&#8217;s guilty, he&#8217;s guilty, don&#8217;t let that boy go free</em></p>\n<p>The jury&#8217;s out on whether Bruce sings &#8220;Charged with&#8221; or &#8220;George was&#8221; in the first line of the second verse. I&#8217;ve seen both put forward, and depending on the performance I can hear one or the other. Perhaps Bruce switched it up or evolved the song over time, but I lean toward believing it&#8217;s &#8220;charged with&#8221; in all instances. The song doesn&#8217;t require a named protagonist, and the litany of crimes both trivial and capital suggests a trumped up case against a defendant who doesn&#8217;t stand a chance.</p>\n<p>In later performances, Bruce would add a verse after the mid-song jam that lends evidence to the &#8220;charged with&#8221; interpretation:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Oh your honor, oh won&#8217;t you treat me fair?</em><br />\n<em>All I want is justice, this court is like a county fair</em><br />\n<em>Can I get what I want there, what I need there</em><br />\n<em>I don&#8217;t know, I don&#8217;t know right now&#8230;</em></p>\n<p>You can hear that additional verse in the performance below, along with an even more ferocious guitar solo.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen and Steel Mill: Guilty 1971 01 23, Upstage, Asbury Park, NJ\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tkcpeSH555M?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>That clip you just listened to also happens to be the very last performance of both the song and the band, on January 23, 1971.</p>\n<p>Both &#8220;He&#8217;s Guilty (The Judge Song)&#8221; and Steel Mill were never heard from again&#8211;at least in their original incarnation.</p>\n<p>In 2005, however, original Steel Mill (and E Street Band) drummer Vini Lopez formed a new version of Steel Mill, called Steel Mill Retro&#8211;and their first album, <em>Dead Sea Chronicles</em>, featured a very familiar song under a new title: &#8220;The Judge.&#8221;</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElFaxyfclRc</p>\n<p><strong>He&#8217;s Guilty (The Judge Song)</strong><br />\n<strong>Recorded:</strong> February 22, 1970<br />\n<strong>Released:\u00a0</strong><em>Chapter and Verse\u00a0</em>(2016)<br />\n<strong>First performed:</strong> January 13, 1970 (San Francisco, CA)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> January 23, 1971 (Asbury Park, NJ)</p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
