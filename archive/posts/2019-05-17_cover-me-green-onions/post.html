<p>Given Bruce’s love for everything Stax, “Green Onions” was bound to make an appearance on the E Street Stage sooner or later. Even if you don’t know it by name, you know it by sound–Booker T.’s instrumental B-side to “Behave Yourself” quickly overshadowed its A-side and hit the Billboard Hot 100 during the summer of 1962. Stax rushed an A-side re-release to market in September, barely hitting the shelves before “Green Onions” peaked at #3 the last week of the month.</p>

<p>“Green Onions” went on to enshrine itself in rock and soul history, earning a Grammy Hall of Fame Award in 1999 and distinction as the only instrumental in <em>Rolling Stone’s </em>500 Greatest Songs of All Time roster.</p>
<p>In 2009, when Bruce needed some backing music while collecting mid-show sign requests for the “stump the band” segment of the show, he almost always called for the band to follow him with “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/05/21/cover-me-raise-your-hand/">Raise Your Hand</a>.” Towards the very end of the tour, however, Bruce decided to mix it up: for the final two shows he called for “Green Onions,” an inspired choice for a slot where no one in the band knew at the start just how much time Bruce was going to need.</p>
<p>How’d they do? You can listen for yourself below, but just remember: you may not be able to stump the E Street Band, but it’s also pretty dang tough to beat Booker T. and the M.G.’s.</p>
