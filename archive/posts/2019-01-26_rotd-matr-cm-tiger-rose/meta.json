We know the album he released later that year:\u00a0<em><a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2023/06/03/album-companion-the-ghost-of-tom-joad/\">The Ghost of Tom Joad</a>.\u00a0</em>But that&#8217;s not the album he set out to record.</p>\n<p>At first, his new compositions trended more toward country and rockabilly, with an appropriate assemblage of backing musicians that included Garry, Danny, Soozie, and Marty Rifkin.</p>\n<p>Among the tracks recorded: a wry, country, she-done-me-wrong lament called &#8220;Tiger Rose.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As the album took shape and shifted toward more serious social commentary, &#8220;Tiger Rose&#8221; was dropped, along with other humorous entries like &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/03/05/roll-of-the-dice-im-turning-into-elvis/\">I&#8217;m Turning into Elvis</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/01/12/roll-of-the-dice-its-the-little-things-that-count/\">The Little Things That Count</a>.&#8221; (What an album that would have been!)</p>\n<p>But Garry must have been particularly taken with &#8220;Tiger Rose,&#8221; because when he produced an album for the late, great rockabilly icon Sonny Burgess later that year, he convinced Bruce to let Burgess record the song for his album.</p>\n<p>The result was the second track on Burgess&#8217; 1996 self-titled release.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Tiger Rose\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/p9bxu3XpK7Y?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>The lyrics are clever and straightforward. &#8220;Tiger Rose&#8221; opens as a simple love song, with a devoted narrator professing his eternal love:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Tiger Rose let me read some prose to you</em><br />\n<em>Just as long as it shows my love any verse will do</em><br />\n<em>Honey, I could make you happy if you&#8217;d only let me, heaven knows</em><br />\n<em>My, my Tiger Rose</em></p>\n<p>&#8230;but there&#8217;s a heck of a curve ball in the second verse:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>I went to work this morning on the local commuter train</em><br />\n<em>Stopped back early and I peeked through the window pane</em><br />\n<em>There was a man eating from my refrigerator dressed up in my clothes</em><br />\n<em>Why, why Tiger Rose?</em></p>\n<p>The song heads down a darker path now, but Bruce keeps it more funny than sad:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Called out your name and I kicked down the front door</em><br />\n<em>I grabbed him by my robe and I rassled him across the floor</em><br />\n<em>I told him &#8220;you ain&#8217;t any better than all those other so-and-sos&#8221;</em><br />\n<em>He said I wasn&#8217;t any different than a thousand other Joe Blows</em><br />\n<em>Love disappears so quickly, when it goes it goes</em><br />\n<em>Why, why Tiger Rose?</em><br />\n<em>Bye Bye, Tiger Rose</em></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a fun song, but hardly essential listening. But the imagery of the protagonist wrestling his rival (wearing his own robe), the late-breaking revelation that he&#8217;s not the first gentleman she&#8217;s betrayed him for, and the clever rhyme in the final lines of the verses elevates the song from otherwise-forgettable status to a fun trifle&#8211;one we might hope to yet see Bruce perform on stage someday.</p>\n<p>He actually did perform it twice, though&#8211;with Burgess himself at the Alliance of Neighbors Benefit concerts at the Count Basie Theater in Red Bank in late 2001. It&#8217;s not the tightest of performances, but it&#8217;s certainly a fun one. Take a look.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Tiger rose - sonny burgess &amp; bruce springsteen\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zPY4nX3nWLY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><strong>Tiger Rose<br />\nRecorded:</strong>\u00a0Summer 1995<br />\n<strong>Never released<br />\nFirst performed:\u00a0</strong>October 18, 2001 (Red Bank, NJ)<br />\n<strong>Last performed\u00a0</strong>October 19, 2001 (Red Bank, NJ)</p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
