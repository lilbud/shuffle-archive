***New for 2025:** Audio for 1977*

**1972:** Bruce runs a classified ad in the Asbury Park Press seeking a "together and ready to travel" pianist and country violinist. Let's hope he finds at least one of them. Maybe David Sancious is still available?

**1977:** At Atlantic Studios in New York City, Bruce records "[Talk to Me](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/02/26/roll-of-the-dice-talk-to-me/)," "[Hearts of Stone](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/09/07/roll-of-the-dice-hearts-of-stone/)," "[City of Night](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/06/28/roll-of-the-dice-city-of-night/)," and "[Wrong Side of the Street](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/11/06/roll-of-the-dice-wrong-side-of-the-street/)"– all of which will go unreleased for decades–plus "[The Ballad](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/12/29/roll-of-the-dice-the-ballad/)," which is still unreleased to this day.
