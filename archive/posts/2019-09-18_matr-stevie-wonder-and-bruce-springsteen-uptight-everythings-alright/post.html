<p>Still, Bruce really did join Stevie Wonder on stage for a one-time-only performance of Stevie’s classic “Uptight (Everything’s Alright).”</p>

<p>It was at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City, on the evening of January 18, 1989. The occasion: the fourth annual induction festivities for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. (Back then, the proceedings were a lot more modest than they are today.)</p>
<p>And it wasn’t just Bruce on stage with Stevie–you’ll see Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Tina Turner, Paul Simon, Little Richard, and other luminaries on stage for that amazing jam session.</p>
<p>But Bruce’s appearances are fleeting–just a couple of shots of him playing tambourine and guitar, and if you listen closely you might hear his backing vocals.</p>

<p>So if you come to this blog for a daily dose of Springsteen, I apologize for the lightness of today’s content.</p>
<p>But hey–this is rarely seen footage of an amazing array of talent performing a classic, Grammy-nominated early Stevie Wonder hit. (Stevie’s original topped the U.S. R&amp;B chart for five weeks in 1966.)</p>
<p>That’s gotta be worth a visit, right?</p>
