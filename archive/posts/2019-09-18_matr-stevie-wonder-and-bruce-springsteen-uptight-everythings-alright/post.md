Okay, so this one's a stretch, but I'm a completist, remember?

Still, Bruce really did join Stevie Wonder on stage for a one-time-only performance of Stevie's classic "Uptight (Everything's Alright)."

It was at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City, on the evening of January 18, 1989. The occasion: the fourth annual induction festivities for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. (Back then, the proceedings were a lot more modest than they are today.)

And it wasn't just Bruce on stage with Stevie–you'll see Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Tina Turner, Paul Simon, Little Richard, and other luminaries on stage for that amazing jam session.

But Bruce's appearances are fleeting–just a couple of shots of him playing tambourine and guitar, and if you listen closely you might hear his backing vocals.

So if you come to this blog for a daily dose of Springsteen, I apologize for the lightness of today's content.

But hey–this is rarely seen footage of an amazing array of talent performing a classic, Grammy-nominated early Stevie Wonder hit. (Stevie's original topped the U.S. R&B chart for five weeks in 1966.)

That's gotta be worth a visit, right?
