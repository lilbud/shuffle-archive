It reached the top of the Hot 100 and R&amp;B charts in the U.S., peaked at #2 in the U.K., and became an enduring romantic standard.</p>\n<p>Bruce was captivated by the song early on and has performed it at least once during every decade of his career. Capturing one of those performances on tape or video has proved elusive, however.</p>\n<p>The first time Bruce performed &#8220;Save the Last Dance For Me&#8221; was all the way back in his Bruce Springsteen Band period; the next time was at Steve and Maureen Van Zandt&#8217;s wedding reception a decade later. Ten years after that, an incognito Bruce joined The Iguanas for it at a New Orleans bar. No public document circulates for any of those three performances.</p>\n<p>But at the closing show of the Magic Tour in Kansas City in 2008, fans finally had a chance to hear Bruce perform &#8220;Save the Last Dance For Me&#8221; as a tender, acoustic introduction to &#8220;Dancing in the Dark.&#8221; (Technically, it&#8217;s not the whole song, but it&#8217;s a lot more than a snippet.)</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen Save the last dance for me\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CJG48yQGkQg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>The following year, Bruce debuted an E Street Band arrangement of &#8220;Save the Last Dance For Me&#8221; to say goodbye to the storied Philadelphia Spectrum, and this time we were treated to the whole song.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Springsteen - Save the Last Dance for Me - The Spectrum October 20, 2009\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5H081gJWI6A?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>But Bruce&#8217;s definitive performance of &#8220;Save the Last Dance For Me&#8221; was his last one to date.
