<p>My rule for covering Bruce: Be different or be great.</p>
<p>Sympathy and the Lion, a duo out of Lancaster, PA, does both.</p>
<p>Words can’t describe how much I love their cover of “Glory Days,” so just take a listen. I’ve never heard the song arranged like this before (or since).</p>
<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="426" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCGitYHpsLs" title="Springsteen's &quot;Glory Days&quot; on piano by  Sympathy and the Lion" width="758"></iframe></div>
<p>And just like that, an 80s arena showpiece is transformed into an intimate, aching, truly nostalgic ballad.</p>
<p>I think Bruce would approve.</p>
<p>Let’s hope we hear from these guys again.</p>
