<p>My rule for covering Bruce: Be different or be great.</p>
<p>Sympathy and the Lion, a duo out of Lancaster, PA, does both.</p>
<p>Words can’t describe how much I love their cover of “Glory Days,” so just take a listen. I’ve never heard the song arranged like this before (or since).</p>

<p>And just like that, an 80s arena showpiece is transformed into an intimate, aching, truly nostalgic ballad.</p>
<p>I think Bruce would approve.</p>
<p>Let’s hope we hear from these guys again.</p>
