My rule for covering Bruce: Be different or be great.

Sympathy and the Lion, a duo out of Lancaster, PA, does both.

Words can't describe how much I love their cover of "Glory Days," so just take a listen. I've never heard the song arranged like this before (or since).

And just like that, an 80s arena showpiece is transformed into an intimate, aching, truly nostalgic ballad.

I think Bruce would approve.

Let's hope we hear from these guys again.
