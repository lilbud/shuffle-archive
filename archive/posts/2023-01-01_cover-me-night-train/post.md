Jimmy Forrest recorded “Night Train” in 1952 as a sultry, earthy R&B instrumental.

But when Bruce pulled it out of his hat during his Darkness Tour show in Atlanta, “Night Train” rocked as it hurtled down the tracks.

What prompted the impromptu, accelerated “Night Train” performance?

When Bruce and the band started their second set that night with “,” the fake snowfall went a bit overboard, and a clean-up crew had to come out to mop up the stage.

To kill time while the crew did their work, Bruce led the band through “Night Train” in a one-time-only performance.

It’s never been heard from since.
