<p>When Neil Young played an outdoor show in Long Island’s Jones Beach State Park, he closed the show with “Down by the River” and invited a friend to join him for it.</p>
<p>From that June 14, 1989 show, here’s their beautifully shot performance of Neil’s dark murder ballad, featuring some surprisingly high harmony vocals from Bruce.</p>

<p>Neil and Bruce’s acoustic rendition is moodier and broodier than the guitar-fueled original, and the result is a performance that would have been right at home on <em>Nebraska</em>.</p>
