<p>From that June 14, 1989 show, here’s their beautifully shot performance of Neil’s dark murder ballad, featuring some surprisingly high harmony vocals from Bruce.</p>

<p>Neil and Bruce’s acoustic rendition is moodier and broodier than the guitar-fueled original, and the result is a performance that would have been right at home on <em>Nebraska</em>.</p>
