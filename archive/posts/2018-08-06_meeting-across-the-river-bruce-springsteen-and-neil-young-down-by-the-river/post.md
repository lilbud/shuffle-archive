When Neil Young played an outdoor show in Long Island’s Jones Beach State Park, he closed the show with “Down by the River” and invited a friend to join him for it.

From that June 14, 1989 show, here’s their beautifully shot performance of Neil’s dark murder ballad, featuring some surprisingly high harmony vocals from Bruce.

Neil and Bruce’s acoustic rendition is moodier and broodier than the guitar-fueled original, and the result is a performance that would have been right at home on *Nebraska*.
