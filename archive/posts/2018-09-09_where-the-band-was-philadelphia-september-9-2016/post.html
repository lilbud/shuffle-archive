<p>Or would this be the exception that disproves the Night One/Night Two truism?</p>
<p>Turns out you top it by keeping a couple of those gems, like the by-now standard “New York City Serenade” opener (that still feels so strange to write)…</p>

<p>…swapping out the rest for genuine by-request wild cards (missing entirely from Night One) like “From Small Things (Big Things One Day Come),” “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/06/05/roll-of-the-dice-im-goin-down/">I’m Goin’ Down</a>,” and “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/06/23/roll-of-the-dice-loose-end/">Loose Ends</a>” (played in succession early in the set)…</p>

<p>…sharing the stage an old friend (even if he looked a little lost up there)…</p>

<p>…and then performing what is easily the most exquisite “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/10/03/roll-of-the-dice-racing-in-the-street/">Racing in the Street</a>” I’ve ever had the privilege to witness.</p>

<p>And it doesn’t hurt to restart my streak of getting at least one personal premiere per show going again, by playing my first “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/05/24/roll-of-the-dice-lucky-town/">Lucky Town</a>.”</p>

<p>I only have one regret from this show: Bruce was slated to start the encore with “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/05/30/roll-of-the-dice-secret-garden/">Secret Garden</a>” which by this point was at the very top of my chase list (this tour had knocked off pretty much everything else), but for some reason Bruce decided to play “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/06/30/roll-of-the-dice-streets-of-philadelphia/">Streets of Philadelphia</a>” for a second night running.</p>

<p>I saw six of the ten shows on this final leg of the tour, and yet I still managed to miss “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/05/30/roll-of-the-dice-secret-garden/">Secret Garden</a>,” which was played at 3 of the 4 shows I missed. But that’s a minor complaint, and one that seems ridiculous in light of a magnificent eight-song encore that also included “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/05/14/roll-of-the-dice-backstreets/">Backstreets</a>” and a show-closing “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/07/24/cover-me-roll-of-the-dice-jersey-girl/">Jersey Girl</a>” with fireworks.</p>

<p>And if the show didn’t set another longest-ever record, that was just fine, too: that night in Philly was one of the most humid I can remember at a show, and by the end of the night I was drenched and exhausted–it was Friday night, and I’d already seen three four-hour-ish shows that week without taking a single day off of work.</p>
<p>And I still had one more show to go that weekend–one that would be my last E Street show to date.</p>
