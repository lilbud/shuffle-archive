<p>The big question in my mind coming out of <a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/09/07/where-the-band-was-philadelphia-september-7-2016/">Night One in Philadelphia</a>: how do you top a show that includes “New York City Serenade,” “<a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/02/20/roll-of-the-dice-lost-in-the-flood/">Lost in the Flood</a>,” “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/01/22/roll-of-the-dice-kittys-back/">Kitty’s Back</a>, “<a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/12/14/roll-of-the-dice-incident-on-57th-street/">Incident on 57th Street</a>,” “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/10/04/roll-of-the-dice-the-fever/">The Fever,</a>” “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/09/24/roll-of-the-dice-thundercrack/">Thundercrack</a>, “<a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/01/22/roll-of-the-dice-downbound-train/">Downbound Train</a>,” “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/06/30/roll-of-the-dice-streets-of-philadelphia/">Streets of Philadelphia</a>,” and “Jungleland” on Night Two?</p>
<p>Or would this be the exception that disproves the Night One/Night Two truism?</p>
<p>Turns out you top it by keeping a couple of those gems, like the by-now standard “New York City Serenade” opener (that still feels so strange to write)…</p>

<p>…swapping out the rest for genuine by-request wild cards (missing entirely from Night One) like “From Small Things (Big Things One Day Come),” “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/06/05/roll-of-the-dice-im-goin-down/">I’m Goin’ Down</a>,” and “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/06/23/roll-of-the-dice-loose-end/">Loose Ends</a>” (played in succession early in the set)…</p>

<p>…sharing the stage an old friend (even if he looked a little lost up there)…</p>

<p>…and a young fan (who couldn’t have seemed more at home)…</p>

<p>…and then performing what is easily the most exquisite “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/10/03/roll-of-the-dice-racing-in-the-street/">Racing in the Street</a>” I’ve ever had the privilege to witness.</p>

<p>And it doesn’t hurt to restart my streak of getting at least one personal premiere per show going again, by playing my first “<a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/05/24/roll-of-the-dice-lucky-town/">Lucky Town</a>.”</p>
<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="426" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPk_tcXVVSs" title="Bruce Springsteen Lucky Town Philadelphia September 9, 2016 Citizens Bank Park" width="758"></iframe></div>
<p>I only have one regret from this show: Bruce was slated to start the encore with “<a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/05/30/roll-of-the-dice-secret-garden/">Secret Garden</a>” which by this point was at the very top of my chase list (this tour had knocked off pretty much everything else), but for some reason Bruce decided to play “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/06/30/roll-of-the-dice-streets-of-philadelphia/">Streets of Philadelphia</a>” for a second night running.</p>
<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="426" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmqYhkmaCIE" title="Streets of Philadelphia - Springsteen - Philadelphia Sept 9, 2016" width="758"></iframe></div>
<p>I saw six of the ten shows on this final leg of the tour, and yet I still managed to miss “<a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/05/30/roll-of-the-dice-secret-garden/">Secret Garden</a>,” which was played at 3 of the 4 shows I missed. But that’s a minor complaint, and one that seems ridiculous in light of a magnificent eight-song encore that also included “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/05/14/roll-of-the-dice-backstreets/">Backstreets</a>” and a show-closing “<a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/07/24/cover-me-roll-of-the-dice-jersey-girl/">Jersey Girl</a>” with fireworks.</p>
<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="426" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAE5yr3enQI" title="Bruce Springsteen &amp; The E Street Band - Jersey Girl - Citizens Bank Park - 09/09/16" width="758"></iframe></div>
<p>And if the show didn’t set another longest-ever record, that was just fine, too: that night in Philly was one of the most humid I can remember at a show, and by the end of the night I was drenched and exhausted–it was Friday night, and I’d already seen three four-hour-ish shows that week without taking a single day off of work.</p>
<p>And I still had one more show to go that weekend–one that would be my last E Street show to date.</p>
