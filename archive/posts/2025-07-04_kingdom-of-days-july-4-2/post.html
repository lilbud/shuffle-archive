<p><strong>1978: </strong>Quite the Independence Day for Bruce in Los Angeles: the day starts off with a trip to KMET-FM, where local DJ Mary Turner interviews an infatuated, talkative Bruce. The interview is loose, rambling, and funny–well worth a listen–with some great stories, including one about the time Bruce played at a mental hospital, where a patient introduced him for twenty minutes, and another about his gig at Sing Sing prison, which has to be heard to be believed. (Bruce refers to both of these gigs during his Broadway show, but here’s where you’ll get the details.)</p>

<p>After the interview, Bruce asks Mary out on a date–and tomorrow night he’ll sweeten the offer with a song dedication. But in the meantime, a loose Bruce, Clarence and Garry hit the town and leave their mark–literally–on a Sunset Strip billboard:</p>

<p><strong>1983: </strong>Bruce spends the holiday on the water: friend and fan Obie Dziedzic charters the 70-foot <em>Atlantis</em> for a three hour cruise for Bruce, the band, and members of Bruce’s gym. After watching the fireworks over Asbury Park, Bruce and company head to The Stone Pony.</p>
