Bruce’s World Tour 1993 stops in Zurich for the first of two shows.

An interview with Australian journalist Molly Meldrum goes off the rails: scheduled as a fifteen-minute conversation at Sony Studios in New York as part of the promotional plan for , Meldrum pushes forward tenaciously for a full ninety minutes, pressing Bruce for insights on his catalog with the deep knowledge and command of minutiae that only an obsessive fan could draw from. The result is fascinating–an essential listen for any serious Bruce fan.

**1995:** *Greatest Hits*
