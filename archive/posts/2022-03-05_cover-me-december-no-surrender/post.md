Glasgow-based indie-rock band December just released their latest single, and it couldn’t be more timely.

Their cover of “[No Surrender](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/11/18/roll-of-the-dice-no-surrender/)” is terrific–nostalgic but fresh, moody but brash, and most importantly as defiant and determined as Bruce’s original.

Based on their Twitter feed they’ve had this in the works for a while now, but the band clearly recognizes that Bruce’s song packs additional power and resonance given the past week’s events in Ukraine.

That’s why they’re asking that appreciative listeners donate to World Central Kitchen, currently serving meals to Ukrainian refugees at the border.
