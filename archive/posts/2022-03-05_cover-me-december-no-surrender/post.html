<p>Glasgow-based indie-rock band December just released their latest single, and it couldn’t be more timely.</p>
<p>Their cover of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/11/18/roll-of-the-dice-no-surrender/">No Surrender</a>” is terrific–nostalgic but fresh, moody but brash, and most importantly as defiant and determined as Bruce’s original.</p>

<p>Based on their Twitter feed they’ve had this in the works for a while now, but the band clearly recognizes that Bruce’s song packs additional power and resonance given the past week’s events in Ukraine.</p>
<p>That’s why they’re asking that appreciative listeners donate to World Central Kitchen, currently serving meals to Ukrainian refugees at the border.
