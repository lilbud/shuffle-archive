<p>Their cover of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/11/18/roll-of-the-dice-no-surrender/">No Surrender</a>” is terrific–nostalgic but fresh, moody but brash, and most importantly as defiant and determined as Bruce’s original.</p>

<p>Based on their Twitter feed they’ve had this in the works for a while now, but the band clearly recognizes that Bruce’s song packs additional power and resonance given the past week’s events in Ukraine.</p>
<p>That’s why they’re asking that appreciative listeners donate to World Central Kitchen, currently serving meals to Ukrainian refugees at the border. (Follow <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/chefjoseandres">Chef José Andrés</a> or <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/WCKitchen">WCK</a> on Twitter for updates about their great work.)</p>
