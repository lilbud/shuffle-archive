It barely cracked the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at #99.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"When You Walk In The Room - Jackie DeShannon (1964)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mVCBSIn_1j0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>But like Bruce, DeShannon is one of those singer-songwriters whose songs often fare better on the charts when other artists cover them. Kim Carnes took DeShannon&#8217;s &#8220;Bette Davis Eyes&#8221; to the top of the charts for nine weeks in 1981, for example, and in 1964 The Searchers took &#8220;When You Walk in the Room&#8221; to #35 in the U.S. and #3 in the U.K.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"&quot;When You Walk In The Room&quot; w/Lyrics- The Searchers\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1h6nsFXXzcI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;When You Walk in the Room&#8221; would go on to chart again in 1981 (by Stephanie Winslow), 1987 (by Paul Carrack), and 1994 (by Pam Tillis).</p>\n<p>But it was that Searchers version that likely inspired Bruce to cover it at The Bottom Line. Bruce had long been inclined to feature sixties covers in his set lists as a way of both acknowledging his influences and keeping their songs alive. Choosing DeShannon&#8217;s song for such a significant stand certainly implied that Bruce held it in high esteem.</p>\n<p>While we unfortunately don&#8217;t have a circulating bootleg of that debut performance, Bruce made up for it by releasing an official archive edition of one of the dozen other shows that year that featured an appearance of DeShannon&#8217;s hit.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a beautiful recording of outing #10, from October 17, 1975 at The Roxy in Los Angeles:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"When You Walk In The Room (Live at The Roxy, West Hollywood, CA - 10/18/75 - Official A...\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5lVgxdfnQ7I?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Bruce played &#8220;When You Walk in the Room&#8221; once more the following year, and then not again for more than three decades.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When You Walk in the Room&#8221; finally reappeared in 2009 as the opening song for the penultimate show Bruce would ever play at the Philadelphia Spectrum.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Springsteen - When You Walk in the Room - The Spectrum October 19, 2009\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9d-rXvjew9U?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>I was there that night, and <a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/10/19/where-the-band-was-philadelphia-october-19-2009/\">I was astounded</a>. Not only was I well aware of the significance of the song in Bruce&#8217;s career and how long it had been since he played it, I was thrilled because I&#8217;d coincidentally had an almost-brush with it<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/08/23/where-the-band-was-st-louis-august-23-2008/\"> a year earlier in St. Louis</a>, when Bruce and the E Street Band rehearsed it but ultimately opened with &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/12/03/cover-me-then-she-kissed-me/\">Then She Kissed Me</a>&#8221; instead.
