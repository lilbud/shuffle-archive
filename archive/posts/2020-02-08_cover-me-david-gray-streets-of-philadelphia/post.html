<p>Singer-songwriter David Gray stopped by the BBC Radio 2 studio recently to celebrate the 20th anniversary of his <em>White Ladder</em> album.</p>
<p>Gray played a few songs from his milestone album live on the air, and he added a special cover as well: Bruce’s award-winning “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/06/30/roll-of-the-dice-streets-of-philadelphia/">Streets of Philadelphia</a>.” It’s a quiet performance that feels unplanned, and it was captured in terrific quality by the studio crew.</p>

<p>Performed solo on the electric piano, Gray’s arrangement sounds like it would have been right at home on Bruce’s 2005 Devils &amp; Dust Tour.</p>
<p>By the way, that guy in the glasses sitting and watching? That’s Abba’s Björn Ulvaeus, also in the studio that day. Too bad he didn’t join in.</p>
<p>That wasn’t the first time Gray has played “Streets of Philadelphia” live though. In fact, he included a terrific cover of it on his 2007 live album, <em>A Thousand Miles Behind</em>.</p>

<p>That album actually featured two covers of Bruce’s songs. We’ll take a listen to the other one sometime soon.</p>
