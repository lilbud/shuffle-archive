Chuck Berry, backed by Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band.</p>\n<p>Bruce made several appearances that night, but none more anticipated than his lengthy (by the night&#8217;s standards, at least) reunion set with his erstwhile band. The reunited E Streeters played a couple of Springsteen originals that night, but their mini-set was primarily comprised of covers of seminal rock classics.</p>\n<p>First out of the gate: a cover of Big Joe Turner&#8217;s &#8220;Shake, Rattle and Roll.&#8221; Truth be told, it wasn&#8217;t a particularly impressive cover. The tempo was plodding, the band too muscular (it would be several years before they&#8217;d learn to swing), and the overall effect was one of sluggishness. It certainly didn&#8217;t convey the sexual heat of the original.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen | Shake, Rattle And Roll - Cleveland - 02/09/1995\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/viNpxPSxQDE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Big Joe Turner&#8217;s risque 1954 original was much lighter on its feet (even if Turner had to slur his lyrics to slip them by the censors). It peaked at #22 on the Billboard pop chart, and <em>Rolling Stone</em> ranked it #127 on their 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"JOE TURNER   Shake, Rattle and Roll   78 rpm  1954\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y9wTQsAgktg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Turner brought even more energy to live performances of the song&#8211;check out this remarkably preserved contemporary performance from shortly after the song was released.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"BIG JOE TURNER.

Beats me. Maybe the band was rusty from not playing together for five months (and before that for over five years). Maybe it was nerves from the assembled rock royalty. Maybe Bruce just hadn&#8217;t fully regained his &#8220;rock voice&#8221; yet.</p>\n<p>But fortunately he did regain it, the band reunited for good, and eighteen years later they took another run at &#8220;Shake, Rattle and Roll.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The scene was Borussia-Park in M\u00f6nchengladbach, Germany on the evening of July 5, 2013.
