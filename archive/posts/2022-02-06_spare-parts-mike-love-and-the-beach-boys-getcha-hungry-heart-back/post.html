<p>When The Beach Boys released “Getcha Back” in 1985, more than a few people noticed that the catchy single sounded more than a little like an earlier hit single from the biggest rock star in the world.</p>

<p>Critics and radio listeners alike noted the similarity between the Mike Love-authored hit single (it peaked at #25 on the Billboard Hot 100) and Bruce’s 1980 single, “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/12/21/roll-of-the-dice-hungry-heart/">Hungry Heart.</a>”</p>

<p>So it was almost funny when Love actually covered “Hungry Heart” for a 2007 Springsteen tribute album–the similarities were now unmistakable.</p>

<p>That cover’s been on my to-blog list for years, but I’ve never been moved enough by it to bump it to the front of the queue. There’s nothing wrong with it, but there’s nothing particularly fresh about it either. The arrangement is faithful, and the performance is exactly what one would expect from Love. “Getcha Back” is actually a better and fresher Beach Boys arrangement for “Hungry Heart” than Mike’s attempt to cover the original.</p>
<p>So I’ve kept it on the “maybe someday” list.</p>
<p>And I’m glad I did, because last night I discovered this mash-up by DJ L33, and it’s <em>perfect</em>.</p>

<p>“Getcha Back” and “Hungry Heart” make for the best kind of mash-up: not only are the two songs musical twins, their lyrics are compatible as well. Framing “Getcha Back” with verses from “Hungry Heart” transforms, matures and even brightens both songs.</p>
<p>Mashing them up was a brilliant inspiration.</p>
