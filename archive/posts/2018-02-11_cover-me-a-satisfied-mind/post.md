Bruce never officially performed “A Satisfied Mind” in concert, but he did play it during a soundcheck in Atlanta on March 23, 1988–and we’re lucky enough to have a recording of it.

This song has been covered by so many artists–and by so many of Bruce’s influences and contemporaries–that it’s hard to say whose version made an impact on him: Glen Campbell? Joan Baez? Lucinda Williams? The Byrds? Bob Dylan? I couldn’t begin to guess from the arrangement alone, so we’ll credit the cover to songwriters Joe “Red” Hayes and Jack Rhodes.

But here’s the original #1 hit version from 1955, by Porter Wagoner:
