<p>Bruce never officially performed “A Satisfied Mind” in concert, but he did play it during a soundcheck in Atlanta on March 23, 1988–and we’re lucky enough to have a recording of it.</p>

<p>This song has been covered by so many artists–and by so many of Bruce’s influences and contemporaries–that it’s hard to say whose version made an impact on him: Glen Campbell? Joan Baez? Lucinda Williams? The Byrds? Bob Dylan? I couldn’t begin to guess from the arrangement alone, so we’ll credit the cover to songwriters Joe “Red” Hayes and Jack Rhodes.</p>
<p>But here’s the original #1 hit version from 1955, by Porter Wagoner:</p>
