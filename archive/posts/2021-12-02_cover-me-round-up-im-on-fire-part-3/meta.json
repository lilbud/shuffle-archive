At this rate, we&#8217;ll never catch up, so let&#8217;s jump right in.</p>\n<p>First up is a familiar face. We met Carson McKee a couple of months ago when we listened to his lovely <a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/09/23/cover-me-carson-mckee-and-skylar-mckee-nebraska/\">cover of &#8220;Nebraska&#8221;</a> with his brother Skylar. Carson has another musical partner, though&#8211;he also performs with Joshua Lee Turner as indie folk duo The Other Favorites.</p>\n<p>Carson and Josh have over 600,000 subscribers on YouTube and their videos have amassed more than 150 million views. Relatively speaking, their terrific video performance of &#8220;I&#8217;m on Fire&#8221; has gone under the radar at &#8220;only&#8221; 73,000 views. Not too shabby, guys.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"The Other Favorites - I&#039;m on Fire (Official Video)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xFiJdnJK7nw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Our next artist made quite the splash with his cover of &#8220;I&#8217;m on Fire&#8221; when he performed it as his live audition for the Australian television show <em>The Voice</em> in 2019. Conor Smith was only sixteen when he skated on stage and blew the judges away with his soulful cover of a song recorded twenty years before he was born.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Conor Smith sings \u2018I&#039;m On Fire\u2019 by Bruce Springsteen | The Voice Stage #73\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mpnohqocBG8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Next is the most adventurous of today&#8217;s batch. Harry Manx&#8217;s music has a unique sound, a marriage of the blues with classic ragas. His cover of &#8220;I&#8217;m on Fire&#8221; is a perfect example, the lead track from his 2007 album with Kevin Breit, <em>In Good We Trust. </em>\u00a0The Indian instrumentation shades Bruce&#8217;s song with tones both bright and brooding, resulting in one of the best covers of &#8220;I&#8217;m on Fire&#8221; and certainly one of the freshest.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Harry Manx &amp; Kevin Breit - I&#039;m on Fire ( Album / Studio Version )\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iVBhmab70PA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Netherlands-based Nikki Henskens is our newest artist in today&#8217;s round-up. She just released <em>Balcony Baby, </em>her debut EP of original material<i>, </i>during the pandemic lockdown. You can check out her original music <a href=\"https://nikkihenskens.nl/?fbclid=IwAR1Vrl2RDTKddAsQ94oE9kGLFywlx67RJStqsFsrBCfh7iGb5mxFMHOf6PU\">here</a>, but she&#8217;s quite the cover artist as well. Her gorgeous vocals are front and center in this intimate solo performance of &#8220;I&#8217;m on Fire.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"I&#039;m On Fire (Bruce Springsteen) covered by Nikki Henskens (live at Fiori e Musica)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RPTVH6XLUEI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>We&#8217;ll wrap up today&#8217;s installment with a cover that not only takes musical liberties but lyrical ones, too.\u00a0 Cody Quintana and Seda are Maui-based musicians who perform together under the name Cuppa. Their interpretation of &#8220;I&#8217;m on Fire&#8221; is more smoke than flame, a world-weary duet between cautious lovers who we sense have been burned before. Seda adds a few verses of her own to flesh out her character, and the result is an instantly recognizable yet very different song.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\"
