This year&#8217;s theme: Elvis.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Oh no,&#8221; Bruce said, &#8220;Because when you sing Elvis, you lose. You&#8217;re not going to sing those songs better than he sang them.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But Bruce couldn&#8217;t and wouldn&#8217;t decline the invitation, of course, and he did end up singing a few Elvis covers at the show. But the idea of trying to imitate Elvis got stuck in his mind, and one afternoon at home he wrote the words:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I&#8217;m turning into Elvis, and there&#8217;s nothing I can do.</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0&#8220;I thought it would be a funny way to contextualize the entire event,&#8221; he told interviewer Neil Strauss in 1995. &#8220;It was very easy to write.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Also fun.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m Turning Into Elvis&#8221; unreels like a shaggy dog story, each verse its own I-can-top-that vignette. It needs no analysis, because there&#8217;s zero subtext. So just enjoy:</p>\n<div id=\"v-ZEiX8nVY-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='426' src='https://videopress.com/embed/ZEiX8nVY?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I woke up in the morning, and I had on blue suede shoes</em><br />\n<em>The pillow crushed my hair into a shiny black pompadour and on my arm was one blue tattoo</em><br />\n<em>Well my wife, she brought me breakfast and I said, &#8220;thank you ma&#8217;am&#8230; god bless you&#8221;</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;m turning into Elvis, and there&#8217;s nothing I can do</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well now, my closet was filled with uncounted jewels and a suit of gold lame</em><br />\n<em>And I put on a belt the size of Memphis, It was inscribed &#8220;Love Priscilla, Yours Always&#8221;</em><br />\n<em>In the pocket there were some little white pills&#8230; yeah, I did them too</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;m turning into Elvis, and there&#8217;s nothing I can do</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well I went downstairs, and I\u00a0kissed the babysitter.

(Bruce previewed his work-in-progress at a private show at Sony Studios a week before the Rainforest gig, playing only a few verses parceled out over the course of the show, and then debuted the song at Carnegie Hall the week following.)</p>\n<p>Bruce envisioned the song as &#8220;a talking blues&#8230; You could have a competition where everyone could send in their own verses.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He took that notion to heart&#8211;over the course of the Ghost of Tom Joad Tour, he&#8217;d use that same concept (and sometimes the same melody) to write other talking blues songs like &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/02/09/roll-of-the-dice-sell-it-and-they-will-come/\">Sell It and They Will Come</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/12/08/roll-of-the-dice-pilgrim-in-the-temple-of-love/\">Pilgrim in the Temple of Love</a>.&#8221; (Hey, a rock star/family man&#8217;s gotta do <em>something</em> to entertain themselves at night on the road.) A decade later, in fact, he was still using it for songs like <a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/06/23/roll-of-the-dice-yankees-win/\">Yankees Win</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But &#8220;I&#8217;m Turning Into Elvis&#8221; was where it started. One wonders just how many other variations are scrawled through the pages of Bruce&#8217;s notebook, unheard except for the hotel guests in the room next door.</p>\n<p><strong>I&#8217;m Turning Into Elvis<br />\nNever recorded</strong><br />\n<strong>Never released</strong><br />\n<strong>First performed:</strong> April 5, 1995 (New York City, NY)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> November 19, 1996 (Memphis, TN)</p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
