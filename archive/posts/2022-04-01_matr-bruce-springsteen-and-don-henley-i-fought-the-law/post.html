<p>When Bruce Springsteen first covered “I Fought the Law” in 1978, he introduced it as “a song originally done by The Bobby Fuller Four.”</p>

<p>That wasn’t quite accurate, but it’s an understandable mistake–even though the song was originally recorded and released by another group Bruce admired. The Crickets recorded “I Fought the Law” in 1959, one of their first songs following the death of their lead vocalist and guitarist, the great Buddy Holly.</p>

<p>The song went nowhere, though, except for the B-side of “A Sweet Love” and an album track the following year. A couple of artists tried and failed to make the charts with a cover version over the next few years, including Bobby Fuller in 1964. Fuller got some local attention with it, but nationally “I Fought the Law” remained under the radar.</p>
<p>But when Fuller switched labels in 1965 and recorded a new version of “I Fought the Law” with his band The Bobby Fuller Four, the song finally caught fire and stormed up the charts, peaking at #9 on the Billboard Hot 100.</p>

<p>Fuller’s version is considered to be the definitive one, ranking #175 on <em>Rolling Stone’s</em> 500 Greatest Songs of All Time and enshrined in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame’s 500 Songs That Shaped Rock. Fuller didn’t get to enjoy his breakthrough success for long, though–he was dead six months later under mysterious and suspect circumstances.</p>
<p>At the same time Bruce was playing (and mistakenly attributing) “I Fought the Law” in 1978, Joe Strummer and Mick Jones were meanwhile discovering the Bobby Fuller version on a jukebox in the San Francisco studio where they were recording for The Clash’s sophomore album.</p>
<p>They fell in love with the song, recorded it, and added it as an extra track to the American release of their debut album the following year. That cover gained The Clash their first real American airplay when it was released as their first U.S. single.</p>

<p>By the time Bruce played it again on his next tour, “I Fought the Law” was no longer an oldies standard–it was fresh, hip, and on the radio waves worldwide.</p>

<p>Bruce continued covering “I Fought the Law” with the E Street Band throughout the River Tour, and the song made cameo appearances on almost every subsequent E Street Band Tour as well.</p>

<p>If there’s a single performance that stands out, however, it’s probably the song’s first appearance in the post-Reunion era, in Dallas in 2002.</p>
<p>Bruce invited a special guest to join him on stage that night. Don  Henley and Bruce had never before (or since) performed together in concert, although they’d shared a crowded stage at a few benefits and a Hall of Fame induction.</p>
<p>For their one and only true team-up, they covered one of rock’s true classics: The Crickets’ (via The Bobby Fuller Four) rock and roll lament, “I Fought the Law.”</p>
