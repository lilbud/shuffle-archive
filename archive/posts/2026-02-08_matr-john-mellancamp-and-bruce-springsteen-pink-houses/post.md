I reckon every songwriter has a list of songs they wish they’d written, and I have to imagine that “Pink Houses” is on Bruce’s.

John Mellencamp’s 1983 single (it peaked at #8 in early 1984) has a lot in common with Bruce’s material at the time. For one thing, it was famously misinterpreted. With an anthemic backing track and a rousing chorus, it’s easy to overlook the song’s critical lyrics, which scold America for not being accountable to its ideals.

In fact, while President Reagan was latching onto Bruce’s “Born in the U.S.A.” during his 1984 reelection campaign, he was also playing “Pink Houses” at his campaign stops. “Pink Houses” has been co-opted by conservative politicians and causes ever since its release; its very liberal author had to ask candidates Reagan, Bush, and McCain to kindly cease and desist.

Today, “Pink Houses” is considered one of Mellencamp’s greatest songs, and has enshrined it as #447 on its Greatest Songs of All-Time list.

And yet, even though Bruce and John have shared a stage together a few times over the years, they never teamed up on the most likely candidate from John’s catalog.

Not until 2019, at least. At the 1980s-themed benefit concert for The Rainforest Foundation, Bruce and John finally found their moment. During Mellencamp’s set that evening, he invited a special guest to join him on stage–and what followed was the first and only team-up to date between Bruce and John on one of their own songs.

John returned the favor shortly after, which left them tied at one each. With luck, we’ll get to see Bruce and John explore each other’s catalogs more deeply in the future.
