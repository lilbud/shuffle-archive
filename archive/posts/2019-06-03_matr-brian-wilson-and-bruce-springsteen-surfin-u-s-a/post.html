<p>It took more than fifty years after its release, but Bruce Springsteen finally covered the immensely popular “Surfin’ U.S.A.” with its original artist and songwriter.</p>
<p>Brian Wilson wrote “Surfin’ U.S.A.” (the lyrics at least–the melody was lifted from “<a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/06/18/cover-me-sweet-little-sixteen/">Sweet Little Sixteen</a>“) and recorded it with The Beach Boys.</p>

<p>Released as both a single and the title track from their 1963 album, “Surfin’ U.S.A.” rocketed up the charts. It peaked at #3 but had such staying power that Billboard ranked it #1 for the entire year. Curiously, though, its radio popularity didn’t translate to record sales; “Surfin’ U.S.A.” has never been awarded gold record status.</p>
<p>Bruce has often cited The Beach Boys as a musical influence, but although he’d <a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/04/07/kingdom-of-days-april-7-2/">crossed paths</a> with the band <a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/04/11/kingdom-of-days-april-11-2/">a few times</a> in the early days, he never performed with Brian or the band on stage.</p>
<p>Until July 1, 2015, that is.</p>
<p>That night, Brian Wilson played the PNC Bank Arts Center in Holmdel, New Jersey, and Bruce came out to catch the show. Brian called Bruce to the stage during the encores, and although Bruce did his best at first to linger in the background, Brian was having none of it.</p>
<p>At the end of “Barbara Ann,” Brian beckoned Bruce front and center, and Bruce obliged. A little awkwardly at first, Bruce provided backing vocals and hand claps on “Surfin’ U.S.A.” but once he strapped on a guitar, any reservations were gone, much to the delight of the hometown crowd.</p>
<p>Check out that performance below–“Surfin’ U.S.A.” starts around the one-minute mark.</p>
