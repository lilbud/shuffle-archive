You’re familiar with Lisa Lowell’s voice, even if you don’t know her name.

You can hear her backing vocals all over Bruce’s album, as far back as “,” and even on recently released tracks like “.” And of course, she was an on-stage presence throughout the Seeger Session Tour.

We actually heard a bit of Lisa’s work yesterday in Patti Scialfa’s “.” We rarely get a chance to hear her lead vocals, though. That’s too bad, because she’s a wonderful singer.

So today, let’s take a listen to Lisa performing Bruce’s “” live on E Street Radio way back in 2011. She gives it a terrific and nuanced reading.

(By the way, there’s another familiar talent on display in that performance, although you can’t actually see him: that’s Larry Eagle of the Sessions Band on percussion.)

For more Lisa Lowell, check out her solo album, . We took a look at one of the album’s standout tracks (““) a year and a half ago, because Bruce plays guitar on it, but the whole album is great.
