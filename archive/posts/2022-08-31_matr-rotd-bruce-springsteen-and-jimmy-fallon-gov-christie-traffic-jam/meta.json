Oops, that&#8217;s not quite right. I meant no\u00a0<em>good</em> reason.</p>\n<p>Because someone was using the bridge closure to send a message, and that someone was New Jersey&#8217;s republican governor Chris Christie, as retribution for the refusal of Fort Lee&#8217;s mayor to endorse the governor&#8217;s reelection bid.</p>\n<p>(The message actually came from members of Christie&#8217;s administration, who Christie readily threw under the bus as details of the scandal came to light. No evidence ever incontrovertibly linked Christie&#8217;s involvement to the incident.)</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Chris Christie &#039;Bridgegate&#039; Scandal\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/34Gdu-TINEM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>By early 2014, &#8220;Bridgegate&#8221; was a national scandal. Americans watched in outrage and schadenfreude as the true story unfolded, and Christie went from respected presidential hopeful to the butt of late night comedians&#8217; jokes.</p>\n<p>One of those comedians was Jimmy Fallon, who carped the diem when Bruce Springsteen joined him on his show on January 14 to promote his new album,\u00a0<em>High Hopes</em>. \u00a0By that time, Bruce had already made two tongue-in-cheek appearances with Fallon covering songs like &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/09/05/matr-bruce-springsteen-and-jimmy-fallon-whip-my-hair/\">Whip My Hair</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/03/24/matr-bruce-springsteen-and-jimmy-fallon-sexy-and-i-know-it/\">Sexy and I Know It</a>,&#8221; but this time the pair did a rewrite on one of Bruce&#8217;s own songs.</p>\n<p>And not just any song. They rewrote &#8220;Born to Run&#8221; in light of recent events (I suspect Fallon and his team did the heavy lifting) and opened the show with Fallon doing his best 80s Bruce impersonation. Before long, though, the real Springsteen (in classic 80s getup) joined him at the microphone.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"www.facebook.com/SpringsteenChile\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/84278263?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write\"></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;Gov.

I imagine Christie must have had mixed emotions watching that performance on television that night.</p>\n<p>The scandal would play out for another two years, with Christie aides and appointees David Wildstein, Bridget Ann Kelly and Bill Baroni eventually all found guilty for their roles.</p>\n<p>As for Christie, he remained in office for the rest of his term, flamed out quickly in a 2016 presidential bid, and spent the years since as a registered lobbyist, occasional Trump advisor, and frequent television commentator.</p>\n<p>Christie left office in 2018 with an 81% disapproval rating, the lowest in New Jersey history, goosed in some small part by the good-natured ridicule of New Jersey&#8217;s favorite son.</p>\n<p>But at least for Christie, there were no hard feelings. On his first day as a private citizen again, he spent it seeing\u00a0<em>Springsteen on Broadway.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Gov.
