<p>Every week brings a new wave of Springsteen covers, and I try to watch them all.</p>
<p>The vast majority of them are just what you’d expect: a fan in home studio paying tribute to their idol in passable but unremarkable fashion. I watch them once and then move on to the next. But when I find the rare gem, I bring it to your attention here.</p>
<p>Today’s entry is a bona fide diamond.</p>
<p>Jake Thistle may only be fifteen years old, but the New Jersey teen is already a remarkably talented musician working on his first EP. And if his cover of Bruce’s “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/07/25/roll-of-the-dice-real-world/">Real World</a>” (in its original Christic arrangement) is anything to judge by, he’s got a great career ahead of him.</p>
<p>Watch this one–it’s an amazingly heartfelt and accomplished performance.</p>

<p>There aren’t many covers of this particular song out there, but I have a feeling Jake’s version would be at the top of the heap even if there were.</p>
