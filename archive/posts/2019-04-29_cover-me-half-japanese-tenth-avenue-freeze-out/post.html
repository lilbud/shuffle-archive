<p>I don’t even know what to say about Half Japanese’s cover of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/11/19/roll-of-the-dice-tenth-avenue-freeze-out/">Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out</a>” other than: if you already know their style, you already know what to expect.</p>
<p>And if you don’t, just know that they’ve been around about as long as Bruce has and that they have a rather laissez faire (at best) attitude toward things like, say, melody and chords. Also tuning. Sometimes even stringing. And they have a cult following for precisely those reasons, along with a fervor and a passion for rock and roll that rivals Bruce’s even if on a completely different vector.</p>
<p>So, yeah. That’s pretty much what you need to know. Go ahead now and listen to “Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out” from the band’s 1980 studio album, <em>Half Gentlemen/Not Beasts</em>. You’ll know within 20 seconds whether you want to listen all the way through.</p>
