<p>At a Vancouver concert in 2010, Vampire Weekend delighted fans with a cover of Bruce’s “I’m Goin’ Down.”</p>
<p>Just after they premiered it in Vancouver, the band made a special stop to play an acoustic set for Seattle radio station 107.7 The End before their show in Redmond’s Marymoor Park.</p>
<p>Fortunately, “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/06/05/roll-of-the-dice-im-goin-down/">I’m Goin’ Down</a>” was on the setlist, so we now have a wonderfully shot and recorded acoustic rendition to enjoy.</p>

<p>The band continued to perform “I’m Goin’ Down” through the rest of the summer and early fall, but it doesn’t appear to have made their setlist since.</p>
