Why, why, *why* did Patti Scialfa not release “Rainy Day Man” as the lead single (or any single) off her magnificent 2007 album *Play It As It Lays?*

She was robbed, I tell you, *robbed.* “Rainy Day Man” has hit single written all over it: it’s breezily funky, confidently sexy, and probably my favorite track from her three wonderful albums. How can anyone resist that “sugar sugar sugar baby bang bang touch”? That’s pure pop brilliance.

(I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it more: *Play It As It Lays* is the better of the two albums released by the Springsteen/Scialfa household that year, and I say that as a big fan of *Magic.* If you haven’t given Patti’s last album a listen, you really should.)

The songs on *Play It As It Lays* were going to be great anyway–Patti’s songwriting was at the top of her game, and her vocals are strong, smoky, and sultry. (She draws that “ssssssatin valentine” out to the perfect nanosecond.) Her backing vocalists are terrific talents, too, and very familiar ones to E Street Nation–that’s Soozie Tyrell and Lisa Lowell you hear.

But what takes the album into flight is her backing group of musicians, the self-dubbed The Whack Brothers Rhythm Section. Accomplished musicians all, there’s a comfort and ease between them that makes the entire album a joy to listen to, but perhaps no more than on “Rainy Day Man.”

You know most of the Whack Brothers: Besides Clifford Carter on keyboards and Willie Weeks on bass (both of whom played on Patti’s previous album as well), there’s Steve Jordan on percussion (who previously appeared all over *Devils & Dust* and later on “[Easy Money](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/06/10/roll-of-the-dice-easy-money/)“), and the very familiar Nils Lofgren on pedal steel and dobro.

Oh, and there’s one more Whack: Patti’s husband, Mr. Rainy Day Man himself, who makes his electric guitar entrance just before Patti calls his name.

I’m not aware of a live performance of “Rainy Day Man,” sadly, and that’s too bad. This is a song we need to hear live.
