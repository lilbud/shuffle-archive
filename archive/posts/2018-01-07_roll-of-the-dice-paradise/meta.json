LOHAD features more musicians than I can easily count or discern; &#8220;Paradise&#8221; features Bruce, and only Bruce. (He plays guitar, keyboard and percussion on this track, although Patti Scialfa&#8217;s backing vocals can be heard for a few brief monents.) Left to my own devices, I&#8217;d have saved &#8220;Paradise&#8221; for a later installment at a more somber time, but the dice have spoken, so into the breach we go.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Paradise&#8221; requires active listening, so don your headphones or close the door, and soak it in:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Paradise\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rcWF7se6EfA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Paradise is one of Bruce&#8217;s loveliest and most nuanced compositions. It stays with you long after you hear it.</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s it about? Even Bruce himself isn&#8217;t sure. In a promotional interview for\u00a0<em>The Rising</em> (the album this song appears on), Bruce admitted, &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t sure what I was saying when I wrote this song&#8230; [it] was instinctive&#8230; an intuitive thing that fell together in a certain way.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If the message is uncertain, the context is clearer: written in the aftermath of 9/11, Paradise is series of vignettes from the perspective of three different characters.</p>\n<p>Paradise begins and ends with a soft but growing, pulsing drone. Keyboards provide an atmospheric accompaniment to Bruce&#8217;s acoustic guitar and subdued vocals as the first vignette begins:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Where the river runs to black</em><br />\n<em>I take the schoolbooks from your pack</em><br />\n<em>Plastics and wire and your kiss</em><br />\n<em>The breath of eternity on your lips</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>In the crowded marketplace</em><br />\n<em>I drift from face to face</em><br />\n<em>I hold my breath and close my eyes</em><br />\n<em>I hold my breath and close my eyes</em><br />\n<em>And I wait for paradise</em><br />\n<em>And I wait for paradise</em></p>\n<p>The narrator appears to be a parent and a suicide bomber, most likely in the middle east (&#8220;where the riven runs to black&#8221; strikes me as a reference to an oil-rich region). He takes his child&#8217;s school backpack, replaces the textbooks with a plastic and wire bomb, finds a crowded marketplace, and waits for paradise to claim him, presumably detonating the bomb.</p>\n<p>The scene now shifts to the United States:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>The Virginia hills have gone to brown</em><br />\n<em> Another day another sun going down</em><br />\n<em> I visit you in another dream</em><br />\n<em> I visit you in another dream</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I reach and feel your hair</em><br />\n<em> Your smell lingers in the air</em><br />\n<em> I brush your cheek with my fingertips</em><br />\n<em> I taste the void upon your lips</em><br />\n<em> And I wait for paradise</em><br />\n<em> And I wait for paradise</em></p>\n<p>Bruce has said that he had a particular woman in mind, when he wrote this verse&#8211;a fan that he&#8217;d met, who&#8217;d lost her husband at the Pentagon attack on 9/11 (hence, the Virignia location).</p>\n<p>In this verse, color is lacking in her life; each day is just &#8220;another day,&#8221; each night just &#8220;another sun going down.&#8221; But in her dreams, she visits her husband, and the detail of her dreams (the feel of his hair, his smell, the taste of the void) stands in marked contrast to her brown reality. And she waits for paradise to see him again.</p>\n<p>The scene shifts a final time:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I search for you on the other side</em><br />\n<em> Where the river runs clean and wide</em><br />\n<em> Up to my heart the waters rise</em><br />\n<em> Up to my heart the waters rise</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I sink &#8216;neath the water cool and clear</em><br />\n<em> Drifting down I disappear</em><br />\n<em> I see you on the other side</em><br />\n<em> I search for the peace in your eyes</em><br />\n<em> But they&#8217;re as empty as paradise</em><br />\n<em> They&#8217;re as empty as paradise</em></p>\n<p>This person is also grieving&#8211;and that grief almost claims him. He wades into the river that divides life and death, and goes so deep that the waters rise up to his heart, a clever literary device that makes the listener uncertain whether this river is literal, metaphorical, or both.</p>\n<p>In the cold darkness of the river (one of Bruce&#8217;s favorite and most frequent metaphors, by the way), he finds his loved one and searches her eyes for evidence that she is at peace&#8211;but her eyes are &#8220;empty as paradise.&#8221;</p>\n<p>And when things are about as dark as they can get, Bruce tacks on two final, orphaned lines:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I break above the waves</em><br />\n<em> I feel the sun upon my face</em></p>\n<p>&#8230;making it clear that this final narrator does not succumb to paradise, but instead rises once again to the surface and feels sunlight on his face, a sign of acceptance and moving forward.</p>\n<p>In the same promotional interview, Bruce says that was trying to say that &#8220;hey, all we have is this life, and we have this world, and it&#8217;s all we can count on.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Paradise&#8221; generated some controversy upon its release. Bruce was accused by some of humanizing terrorists during the peak of the nation&#8217;s post-9/11 paranoia. And of course, that&#8217;s <em>exactly</em> what he was doing. There are many themes that run through Bruce&#8217;s work, and one of them is the attempt to understand that which defies comprehension. The suicide bomber in the first verse is hardly the first seemingly unsympathetic narrator Bruce has embraced (one could argue that the protagonist of &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/04/16/roll-of-the-dice-nebraska/\">Nebraska</a>&#8221; is far more difficult to empathize with). What makes this song so poignant, and lovely is the careful empathy and delicate detail that defines and links the characters in their expectations and understanding of paradise.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Paradise&#8221; is rarely performed&#8211;Bruce has played it only 15 times ever. It made its live debut on July 30, 2002, at the first rehearsal show for the Rising Tour. Unsurprisingly, it was almost immediately dropped from the set, surfacing only once during the entire tour. The song is too quiet and demands too much focused attention for it to be well served by an arena and stadium tour. However, you can hear that first performance here, notable for Soozie Tyrell&#8217;s gorgeous viola accompaniment.</p>\n<audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-127-5\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/202-bruce_springsteen-paradise-aaf.mp3?_=5\" /><a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/202-bruce_springsteen-paradise-aaf.mp3\">http://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/202-bruce_springsteen-paradise-aaf.mp3</a></audio>\n<p>&#8220;Paradise&#8221; found an on-stage home in 2005, however. Far more suited to the stripped-down, intimate setting of an acoustic theater tour, Bruce performed the song a dozen times, seamlessly switching from an electric keyboard to an acoustic piano between the second and third verses to great effect, telegraphing the determination of the final point-of-view character to find his paradise in the here and now.\u00a0 Watch a gorgeous performance of this arrangement, performed in East Rutherford on May 19, 2005.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - PARADISE 2005\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EmZLYGjDiQc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Have a different or personal take on &#8220;Paradise?&#8221; Share your thoughts below!</p>\n<p><strong>Paradise<br />\nRecorded:</strong> February-March, 2002<br />\n<strong>Released:\u00a0</strong><em>The Rising\u00a0</em>(2002)<br />\n<strong>First performed:</strong> July 30, 2002\u00a0 (Asbury Park, NJ)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> August 13, 2005 (Vancouver, BC)</p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
