Most people associate “The End of the Innocence” with Don Henley, who scored one of the biggest hits of 1989 (peaking at #8 on the Billboard Hot 100) with it when he released it as the lead single and title track from his third solo album.

But true Bruce fans know that Henley was only the song’s writer–it was actually co-written and co-produced by Bruce, and it’s been a reliable staple of Bruce’s setlists ever since.

*co-*

What’s that?

Oh, sorry–I should have clarified: Bruce is the co-writer/co-producer of “The End of the Innocence,” and that’s him you hear on piano as well.

*Hornsby*

But that doesn’t mean the song doesn’t have a connection to Bruce too.

*Springsteen*

In December 2001, Bruce reprised his highly successful “…and friends” holiday/community benefit shows in Asbury Park, and this time in addition to the usual suspects, the roster included two guest appearances by Bruce Hornsby.

Among the songs the Bruces performed together was Hornsby and Henley’s “The End of the Innocence,” backed by the Max Weinberg 7. Lyrically, the song was tailor-made for both Bruces, and both turned in smooth vocals laced with poignancy and memory. Take a listen:

What’s the holiday connection? Beats the heck out of me.

All I know is we got a one-time (well, two-time) pairing on a gorgeous song, and that’s good enough for me.
