Mary Cutrufello has some serious Springsteen credentials.

She’s not just a fan (although she is a life-long one). She put her money where her mouth is, hiring Thom Panunzio (engineer on *Born to Run* and *Tracks* among other E Street contributions) to produce her 1998 LP *When the Night is Through*, and she hired the late, great Danny Federici as her touring keyboardist during the E Street Band hiatus.

So when she chooses to cover Bruce, she goes deep like a true fan would.

Her 2007 album *35* featured her terrific take of Bruce’s “[Take ’em as They Come](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/03/29/roll-of-the-dice-take-em-as-they-come/),” featuring Willy Braun of Reckless Kelly on guest vocals. Take a listen below–she does Bruce proud.
