<p>Mary Cutrufello has some serious Springsteen credentials.</p>
<p>She’s not just a fan (although she is a life-long one). She put her money where her mouth is, hiring Thom Panunzio (engineer on <em>Born to Run </em>and <em>Tracks</em> among other E Street contributions) to produce her 1998 LP <em>When the Night is Through</em>, and she hired the late, great Danny Federici as her touring keyboardist during the E Street Band hiatus.</p>
<p>So when she chooses to cover Bruce, she goes deep like a true fan would.</p>
<p>Her 2007 album <em>35</em> featured her terrific take of Bruce’s “<a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/03/29/roll-of-the-dice-take-em-as-they-come/">Take ’em as They Come</a>,” featuring Willy Braun of Reckless Kelly on guest vocals. Take a listen below–she does Bruce proud.</p>
