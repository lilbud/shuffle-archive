When The Wallflowers showed up for their gig at Tradewinds on the Jersey shore on March 8, 1997, the hype was already at fever pitch: would Bruce show tonight? Undoubtedly, since he'd already been spotted at the afternoon soundcheck.

Sure enough, when The Wallflowers returned to the stage for their encore that evening, they brought a new friend with them. Bruce strapped on a guitar and joined the band for one of the hardest-rocking songs on their new album, "God Don't Make Lonely Girls."

The original album track was never released as a single, but it's easy to understand why it would make an appearance in the band's encores, and why Bruce would be attracted to it: it's one of the album's more straight up hard rockers, with a very *Lucky Town*-ish sound.
