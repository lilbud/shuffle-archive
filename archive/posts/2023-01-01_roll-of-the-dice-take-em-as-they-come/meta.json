Bruce would often record himself at work using an ordinary cassette recorder, and some of those early cassettes somehow escaped into the wild. (One can but wonder how.)</p>\n<p>One of those early escapees reveals Bruce working on a song called &#8220;Take &#8217;em as They Come,&#8221; but it&#8217;s not the song we know from\u00a0<em>Tracks</em>. In fact, it&#8217;s not even a song at all&#8211;there are barely any lyrics. (Don&#8217;t try to strain yourself understanding what Bruce is singing&#8211;when he&#8217;s working on a melody, he often just &#8220;bluffs&#8221; the lyrics, mumbling, scatting, or just throwing out lines in a stream of consciousness.)</p>\n<p>But it&#8217;s clear that Bruce was enamored by the phrase &#8220;take &#8217;em as they come&#8221;&#8211;it&#8217;s pretty much the only thing we can make out clearly and repeatedly.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen Take &#039;Em As They Come #1\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/abBvLmXOsYY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>From the melody in that clip above, it sounds like Bruce originally had something a bit more serious and pensive than what he eventually ended up with, but it didn&#8217;t last long. He soon moved on to a more upbeat melody&#8211;and while this one wouldn&#8217;t last either, it would soon find a home attached to <a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/11/04/roll-of-the-dice-jackson-cage/\">a song that <em>would</em> make it onto <em>The River</em></a>.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen Take &#039;Em As They Come #2\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/n-t7wGtd4j4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>We don&#8217;t know exactly when Bruce landed on the final arrangement for &#8220;Take &#8217;em as They Come,&#8221; but we do know he recorded the backing track later that same year, in December 1979. His vocal, though, didn&#8217;t come until several months later, so it&#8217;s possible that Bruce was still experimenting and cross-pollinating during that time.</p>\n<p>When Bruce finally did combine that infectious backing track with some dark lyrics and the hook he&#8217;d grown so attached to, the result was magic: &#8220;Take &#8217;em as They Come&#8221; easily ranks among the very best of Bruce&#8217;s power pop catalog. Take a listen and hear for yourself:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Take &#039;Em as They Come (Studio Outtake - 1980)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8T7zz6dVJu4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>That is one seriously fine pop song. No one would ever associate Bruce with new wave, but I can&#8217;t help but suspect that &#8220;Take &#8217;em as They Come&#8221; would have been a radio smash had it been released on\u00a0<em>The River</em> in late 1980. But it wasn&#8217;t to be&#8211;&#8220;Take &#8217;em&#8221; spent almost two decades in the vault before Bruce finally released it on his <em>Tracks</em> compilation in 1998.</p>\n<p>The released version has\u00a0<em>such</em> a great hook and backing track, however, that you can listen to it countless times, sing along at the top of your lungs, dance to it without a care if you&#8217;re lucky enough to catch a rare outing in concert&#8230; and yet never once realize:</p>\n<p><em>This is one dark song.</em></p>\n<p>Seriously. Listen carefully to it. As Springsteen often does, this is a case of a bright pop melody that belies some somber lyrics and sinister imagery. We start in a dreamscape with two frightened lovers on the run, pursued by a threatening stranger:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Last night I dreamed we was running through the outlands</em><br />\n<em>Tears streaming, your pretty face all a wreck</em><br />\n<em>I held your daddy&#8217;s gun in my trembling hands</em><br />\n<em>And down the highway another stranger comes</em><br />\n<em>You gotta take &#8217;em baby when they come</em></p>\n<p>That line&#8211;&#8220;take &#8217;em <em>when</em> they come&#8221;&#8211;it&#8217;s not the easygoing refrain it appears to be. It&#8217;s a battle cry&#8211;a declaration of intent to hold one&#8217;s ground, defend the one you love from any threat, and take them down before they take you. The chorus says they&#8217;ll take them <em>as </em>they come, but the verses make it clear that <em>as</em> really means <em>when</em>, and <em>take</em> means <em>remove</em><em>. </em>It&#8217;s not a coincidence that the gun in his dream belongs to his lover&#8217;s father&#8211;our narrator has cast himself as the protector. And because it&#8217;s a dream, we can rest easy that it&#8217;s just symbolism.</p>\n<p>Or can we? Our narrator&#8217;s awake now, ready to head out into the night. But his attitude&#8217;s the same&#8211;he&#8217;s ready for a fight. He expects one, in fact, and he encourages his girl to hide a switchblade in that best dress of hers:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Little girl put on your best dress</em><br />\n<em>&#8216;Cause we&#8217;re going out on the town tonight</em><br />\n<em>Better bring along your switchblade</em><br />\n<em>&#8216;Cause for sure some fool&#8217;s gonna wanna fight</em><br />\n<em>You&#8217;ve got to take &#8217;em baby as they come</em></p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll never learn his backstory, but this is a man who clearly sees life as a never-ending fight, and he believes he is justified for taking up the gauntlet. Whether his girl was with him from the start or joined him along the way, he&#8217;s grateful for his partner in crime and is doing his best to convince her that they&#8217;re on the right path, even if it&#8217;s a dark one:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>But God save the rider in the black night</em><br />\n<em>Save the man who taught that it was right</em><br />\n<em>To do what they have done, girl</em><br />\n<em>To become what we have become</em><br />\n<em>You gotta take &#8217;em baby when they come</em></p>\n<p>He&#8217;s rationalizing, to be sure: If they&#8217;re going to survive, if they&#8217;re going to continue to live the life they&#8217;ve chosen, they&#8217;ve got to strike first&#8211;and it&#8217;s okay, because the law of the street says that&#8217;s the right thing to do.</p>\n<p>The song takes a turn here, and we learn that our anti-hero isn&#8217;t reassuring his girl&#8211;he&#8217;s losing her.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Little girl, gone are the days</em><br />\n<em>Faded away into a clear blue night</em><br />\n<em>And all the vows that we made</em><br />\n<em>Lie shattered and broken in the morning light</em><br />\n<em>You gotta take &#8217;em baby when they come</em></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s possible to read that verse as an implication that these two are working through some kind of infidelity, but I think the vows Bruce refers to aren&#8217;t the ones they made to each other, but rather the ones they made together, as a couple, about the life they wanted to build for themselves.</p>\n<p>This is not the life she wanted, though, and not the one he promised. It&#8217;s taking a toll on their bond, but he&#8217;s learning the wrong lesson from it. So desperate is he to protect her, to preserve her, that he doesn&#8217;t realize he&#8217;s the one causing the harm.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I know your heart is breaking</em><br />\n<em>I can feel it too, girl</em><br />\n<em>Though my finger on the trigger&#8217;s shaking</em><br />\n<em>Here I swear to you, girl</em></p>\n<p>Whether you read the song literally or metaphorically, what&#8217;s clear is that he truly views life as the two of them against the world, and when you truly live that way, you go down a dark and lonely road of isolation.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>If I could take all your sorrow</em><br />\n<em>So that you&#8217;d never cry, girl, or be blue</em><br />\n<em>Come tomorrow, girl</em><br />\n<em>What I&#8217;d do for you, little one</em><br />\n<em>I swear I&#8217;ll take &#8217;em baby when they come<br />\n</em></p>\n<p>That last line is as chilling as any in Springsteen&#8217;s catalog. What lengths will our anti-hero go to for his love? We can only shudder and wonder.</p>\n<p>But we can&#8217;t end a discussion of &#8220;Take &#8217;em as They Come&#8221; without mentioning the brilliant false ending: as the guitars fade, Max holds the beat&#8211;and holds, and holds, and holds&#8211;until the band finally returns and carries the song into the night. It&#8217;s more than a clever device&#8211;it underscores the narrator&#8217;s determination to never let his guard down, to always be on watch, to never stop moving.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a brilliant ending to a powerful song.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Bruce reunited the E Street Band shortly after releasing his\u00a0<em>Tracks</em> box set, and especially during the early legs of the tour, his outtake collection provided the E Street Band with a lot of new material to supplement their classics.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Take &#8217;em as They Come&#8221; was one of the earlier tracks to debut, coming out to play for the first time on June 15, 1999 in Offenbach. That first performance was just a bit too plodding, though.</p>\n<div id=\"v-wGZfQBl3-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='426' src='https://videopress.com/embed/wGZfQBl3?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>The band would get better as time went by, but for reasons I can&#8217;t guess, Bruce all but retired the song after the Reunion Tour. He&#8217;s only played it twice since, once on the Rising Tour, and once almost a decade later on the Wrecking Ball Tour&#8211;thanks to a diligent, persistent, fan who absolutely refused to give up asking for it.</p>\n<p>And that last time, at Hyde Park&#8211;they\u00a0<em>nailed</em> it (even if Bruce truncated the false ending). Enjoy that performance (captured on video, no less) below.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Take&#039;m As They Come\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CuvU0sd6Fh0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><strong>Bonus:\u00a0</strong>For years before the release of\u00a0<em>Tracks</em>, a bootleg version of &#8220;Take &#8217;em as They Come&#8221; circulated among collectors.
