<p>No lie: Kathleen Edwards’ spectacular cover of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/08/09/roll-of-the-dice-human-touch/">Human Touch</a>” has been at the top of my <em>Cover Me</em> to-blog list since Day One.</p>
<p>So what took me so long to get around to it? I couldn’t find a decent recording.</p>
<p>I fell in love with Edwards’ version of Bruce’s 1992 single when I heard her cover it in concert with Jenn Grant, but the only YouTube videos I’ve been able to find of it are either too distant, too close, or too muffled.</p>

<p>Little did I know, however, that Edwards released a studio version of the song <em>six years ago</em>, but the only place you can find it is on SoundCloud.</p>
<p>Fortunately, friend of the blog and (guest blogger twice this week!) Dan French knew about it and pointed me to it, so now I can <em>finally</em> share it with you.</p>
<p>And the best part is that Edwards’ studio version (actually a duet with fellow Canadian singer-songwriter Afie Jurvanen) is even lovelier than her live version, especially that gorgeous, luminescent bridge–easily my favorite moment in one of my favorite Springsteen covers.</p>

<p>Thanks again, Dan–both for giving me a couple of days off this week and for helping me clear one very long-standing entry from my to-blog list!</p>
