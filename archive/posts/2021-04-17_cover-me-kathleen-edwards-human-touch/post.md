> "I've always kept my expectations realistic. The only thing I know I can do is try to be relevant musically and write songs that mean something. Everything else will come. I don't have to have a career like Bruce Springsteen's to see myself as successful." — *Kathleen Edwards, November 2008*

No lie: Kathleen Edwards' spectacular cover of "[Human Touch](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/08/09/roll-of-the-dice-human-touch/)" has been at the top of my *Cover Me* to-blog list since Day One.

So what took me so long to get around to it? I couldn't find a decent recording.

I fell in love with Edwards' version of Bruce's 1992 single when I heard her cover it in concert with Jenn Grant, but the only YouTube videos I've been able to find of it are either too distant, too close, or too muffled.

Little did I know, however, that Edwards released a studio version of the song *six years ago*, but the only place you can find it is on SoundCloud.

Fortunately, friend of the blog and (guest blogger twice this week!) Dan French knew about it and pointed me to it, so now I can *finally* share it with you.

And the best part is that Edwards' studio version (actually a duet with fellow Canadian singer-songwriter Afie Jurvanen) is even lovelier than her live version, especially that gorgeous, luminescent bridge–easily my favorite moment in one of my favorite Springsteen covers.

Thanks again, Dan–both for giving me a couple of days off this week and for helping me clear one very long-standing entry from my to-blog list!
