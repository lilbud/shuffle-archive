In the more than fifty years since its release, a wide array of artists have covered it, from Bo Diddley to Emmylou Harris to The Killers&#8211;and (of course) to Bruce Springsteen.</p>\n<p>Springsteen has been a Fogerty fan for as long as he&#8217;s been playing music, first covering him in concert the very same week &#8220;Bad Moon Rising&#8221; was released. No audio exists from that show, but every one of Bruce&#8217;s seven &#8220;Bad Moon Rising&#8221; performances circulates among collectors. His debut performance came at an under-the-radar Halloween show in 1987 with the E Street Band (operating undercover as The Terrorists of Love) at McLoone&#8217;s Rum Runner in Sea Bright, New Jersey.</p>\n<audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-40929-5\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/1987-10-31-Bad-Moon-Rising.mp3?_=5\" /><a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/1987-10-31-Bad-Moon-Rising.mp3\">https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/1987-10-31-Bad-Moon-Rising.mp3</a></audio>\n<p>From a Jersey shore club to a French royal castle: six months later Bruce turned up in Paris, where he concluded his four-song set at the S.O.S.
