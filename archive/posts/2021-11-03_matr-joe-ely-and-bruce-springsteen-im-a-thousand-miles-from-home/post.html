<p><a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/10/17/american-babylon-a-retrospective/"><em>American Babylon</em></a> wasn’t Bruce’s only collaboration with a singer-songwriter named Joe in 1995.</p>
<p>Around the same time he and Joe Grushecky were putting the finishing touches on Grushecky’s landmark album (which was just released as a 25th anniversary edition, and you should really <a href="https://orcd.co/JoeGrusheckyAmericanBabylon25">check it out</a>), Bruce also made a side trip to Austin, where he contributed his vocal and keyboard talents to the opening and closing tracks of Joe Ely’s album, <em>Letter to Laredo</em>.</p>
<p>It’s the opening track that gets all the attention, and it’s hard to argue that “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/02/23/matr-joe-ely-and-bruce-springsteen-all-just-to-get-to-you/">All Just to Get to You</a>” isn’t deserving of it. (We’ll take a listen to that track sometime in the next year.) But the undeservedly overlooked final track merits some love, too.</p>
<p>“I’m a Thousand Miles From Home” is everything “All Just to Get to You” isn’t: slow, simple, meditative, and world-weary.</p>

<p>It also features some <em>very </em>Springsteenian lyrics:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Travelin’ down this weary road</em><br/>
<em>A troubled mind is a heavy load</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Hold my ticket in my hand</em><br/>
<em>Lookin’ for the Promised Land</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>I’m a thousand miles from home</em></p>
<p>It’s pretty easy to see why Bruce would be attracted to a song like this. Bruce’s impassioned backing vocals are clear in the mix, and his voice blends well with Ely’s. (Bruce tends to take the high harmonies when backing other artists.)</p>
<p>Unlike “All Just to Get to You,” which Bruce has performed with Ely seven times in concert, Bruce has yet to perform “I’m a Thousand Miles From Home.” But that’s okay: this is a delicately crafted studio track that’s perfect in its original form.</p>
