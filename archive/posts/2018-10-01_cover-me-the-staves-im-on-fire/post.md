Yes, I know–I’ve already featured [quite a few](http://estreetshuffle.com/?s=i%27m+on+fire) “[I’m on Fire](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/09/11/roll-of-the-dice-im-on-fire/)” covers on the Shuffle, but there are just so darn many of them.

This one in particular is lovely–a quiet, brooding performance by indie-folk trio The Staves out of the UK. Their harmonies lift the song up without losing it’s simmering subtext. And that coda… hauntingly powerful.

Okay, just one more, because I can’t pick my favorite performance–they’re all different, and all beautiful.
