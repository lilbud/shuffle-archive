I had a completely different cover queued up for today and a week’s worth of posts written to follow.

But yesterday morning, I came across a brand new cover of “” by an Italian duo called The Travel Bag, and I’ve played it about a dozen times since.

(I know next to nothing about The Travel Bag except that they consist of Jole Maddalena on vocals and Claudio D’amico on guitar, they’ve got an original you can stream on the major streaming services, their is full of beautiful cover performances, and you should definitely check them out.)

So since I can’t seem to shake my obsession with this absolutely gorgeous-in-every-way performance, I’m bumping the queue so you can enjoy it along with me.

Have a great weekend.
