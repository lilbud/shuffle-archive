One time only: At Neil Young’s inaugural Bridge School Benefit in 1986, Bruce joined Crosby, Still, Nash and Young for a beautifully loose rendition of “Teach Your Children.”

Don Henley, Tom Petty, and Robin Williams(!) join in as well, and while Danny and Nils are only visible for a moment, you can hear them throughout.

The original, of course, can’t be topped.

35 years later, Bruce reprised “Teach Your Children” with Steve Earle, Willie Nile, and Rosanne Cash at Earle’s benefit show in New Yor City.
