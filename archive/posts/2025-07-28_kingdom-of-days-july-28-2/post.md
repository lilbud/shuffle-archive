**1975:** A rainy night plagues Bruce’s performance at the Carter Barron Amphitheater in Washington DC’s Rock Creek Park. Heavy rain delays the start of the show by two hours, and lingering moisture disrupts Bruce’s guitar throughout the show, causing additional mid-show delays. Still, the performance is great, and the crowd is hot. Listen to the rare instrumental “[Funk Song](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/05/02/roll-of-the-dice-funk-song/)” below.
