<p>There’s some debate as to the actual name of this unreleased, never-performed Springsteen original composition.</p>
<p>In Bruce’s handwritten notes, he refers to it as “I Heard the Word,” and certainly that line is oft-repeated. It was eventually copyrighted in 1995 under the title “The Word.”</p>

<p>But in the actual studio recording from 1972, it’s referred to verbally as “The Song,” and so that’s what we’ll go with.</p>
<p>Regardless of what you call the song, “The Song” is rather typical of Bruce’s early songwriting: lyrically lush with colorful nicknames, religious imagery, and dense metaphor describing the unknowable, unattainable, unchainable object of his desire.</p>

<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;"><em>Well you flash your tongue like diamonds</em><br/>
<em>You tied me to your wildcat schemes</em><br/>
<em>And you forced me to into a power dive</em><br/>
<em>And left your mark on my jeans</em><br/>
<em>And I heard the word on your soldiers</em><br/>
<em>And I heard the word on Jesus too</em><br/>
<em>I heard the word on the country</em><br/>
<em>But I never heard the word on you</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Your love was like a machine gun</em><br/>
<em>I wore your bugle in my belt</em><br/>
<em>And I was your kid glove lover</em><br/>
<em>All the cards were yours, you always dealt</em><br/>
<em>And I stood before your soapbox</em><br/>
<em>Noiseless and shoeless playing my pantry boy’s games</em><br/>
<em>You had your raised up, you had your hands raised up</em><br/>
<em>You were raised up to the sky shouting, “Oh Sunday deity</em><br/>
<em>Oh Big Daddy Longlegs, come down and bless your sister please”</em><br/>
<em>You were shouting orders about the construction going on down the highway</em><br/>
<em>Doing the Virginia reel, you were naming names, blaming blames</em><br/>
<em>And you blamed me</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>You wore your heart like a challenge</em><br/>
<em>Far and apart for anyone who came</em><br/>
<em>Open and wide like the river</em><br/>
<em>With rocks on both sides to keep the water tame</em><br/>
<em>But I heard the word on your high tides</em><br/>
<em>And I felt the pain when I tried to rip your floodgates wide</em><br/>
<em>And pull your body on over to my side where we both could hide</em><br/>
<em>But you heard about the freedom ride</em><br/>
<em>And you heard about the highway crew</em><br/>
<em>Who could cut the light a little bit faster than you</em><br/>
<em>So you left me just your shoes</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>And I heard the word on Jesus</em><br/>
<em>And I heard the word on his marching troops</em><br/>
<em>I heard the word on the country</em><br/>
<em>But I never heard the word on you</em></p>
<p>It’s not one of Bruce’s strongest songs, even when considered just among his early work. It’s not surprising it was left off of <em><a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2023/01/05/album-companion-greetings-from-asbury-park-n-j/">Greetings from Asbury Park</a>.</em> But it’s still a fascinating peek at an artist still developing his voice and his style.</p>
