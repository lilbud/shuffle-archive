Bruce plays the first of a pair of unique, remarkable benefit shows for the Christic Institute, a public interest law firm. This is Bruce’s first “official” concert since disbanding the E Street Band. He’s out of his comfort zone, and it shows. His life has changed: he’s firmly attached to Patti now (even if they’re not yet married), he’s a father, and his new life perspective informs the new work that comprises much of the setlist. World premieres abound: “,” “,” “,” and “” all get their very first airings. Intimate performances of “,” “” and “” (which sounds particularly forlorn tonight) take on new life. In the encores, Bonnie Raitt and Jackson Browne join Bruce for “d” and a gorgeous rendition of “.” This show is available for purchase as an official archive series installment (get it ) and is essential for any Springsteen fan.
