<p>This is a song about little things that lead to big things. Small choices that lead to consequential moments. Or as Bruce put it one night, it’s about “not knowing what you’re gonna do until you do it.”</p>
<p>Sometimes he’d introduce it with a story about a girl who did a body shot of tequila off of him. Other times he regaled the audience with a tale of a barmaid who exchanged a ride home for a quarter he needed for the payphone.</p>
<p>Whatever the night’s story, Bruce told it with the barest hint of discretion, a twinkle in his eye, and a disclaimer that all of the events happened “a very, very long time ago”… if they happened at all.</p>

<p>Our tale starts innocently enough, although our narrator’s inner voice knows better from the outset.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>She said we could just sleep together, there’d be nothing wrong</em><br/>
<em>We could just hold each other with our clothes on</em><br/>
<em>I went to answer, “I don’t think we should”</em><br/>
<em>Then I heard a voice say, “yeah, I guess we could…”</em><br/>
<em>She kissed me lightly and said “you know sometimes when you’re down</em><br/>
<em>It’s the little things that count</em><br/>
<em>It’s the little things that count</em><br/>
<em>It’s the little things”</em></p>
<p>Small moments of human connection. That’s what it’s all about, right?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>She said it was too late, and I shouldn’t try to drive</em><br/>
<em>She unbuttoned my shirt and whispered “just close your eyes</em><br/>
<em>Let me take your boots off, you know sometimes when your luck’s run out</em><br/>
<em>It’s the little things that count</em><br/>
<em>It’s the little things that count</em><br/>
<em>It’s the little things”</em></p>
<p>Don’t drive drunk, kids. That’s the moral here.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Her dress rode lightly as she walked</em><br/>
<em>Then she pulled the covers down</em></p>
<p>Okay, so maybe our narrator’s gaze is distracted for a moment. It’s a little thing, a minor detail.</p>
<p>Small kindnesses. Minor details. Little moments… that lead to bigger ones.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>I was so dry, she held a water glass to my lips</em><br/>
<em>Well the polish on her nail was chipped</em><br/>
<em>She said she had a boyfriend I reminded her of</em><br/>
<em>His hair was the same muddy brown</em><br/>
<em>She stuck her tongue in my mouth</em></p>
<p>Because sometimes you just don’t know what you’re going to do until you do it.</p>
<p>I’m pretty sure this isn’t anybody’s favorite Springsteen song. You’ll probably never see it on a request sign, and good luck finding recordings of it on YouTube.</p>
<p>Still, Bruce recorded it not once but <em>twice </em>in the studio–first in 1995 for <em>The Ghost of Tom Joad</em>, and then again in 2004 for <em>Devils &amp; Dust</em>–and he performed it live thirty-eight times during the years in between.</p>
<p>It may be little known, but it counts.</p>
