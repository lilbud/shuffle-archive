Small choices that lead to consequential moments. Or as Bruce put it one night, it&#8217;s about &#8220;not knowing what you&#8217;re gonna do until you do it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Sometimes he&#8217;d introduce it with a story about a girl who did a body shot of tequila off of him. Other times he regaled the audience with a tale of a barmaid who exchanged a ride home for a quarter he needed for the payphone.</p>\n<p>Whatever the night&#8217;s story, Bruce told it with the barest hint of discretion, a twinkle in his eye, and a disclaimer that all of the events happened &#8220;a very, very long time ago&#8221;&#8230; if they happened at all.</p>\n<div id=\"v-DDiHI0Mz-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='568' src='https://videopress.com/embed/DDiHI0Mz?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>Our tale starts innocently enough, although our narrator&#8217;s inner voice knows better from the outset.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>She said we could just sleep together, there&#8217;d be nothing wrong</em><br />\n<em>We could just hold each other with our clothes on</em><br />\n<em>I went to answer, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think we should&#8221;</em><br />\n<em>Then I heard a voice say, &#8220;yeah, I guess we could&#8230;&#8221;</em><br />\n<em>She kissed me lightly and said &#8220;you know sometimes when you&#8217;re down</em><br />\n<em>It&#8217;s the little things that count</em><br />\n<em>It&#8217;s the little things that count</em><br />\n<em>It&#8217;s the little things&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>Small moments of human connection.

Little moments&#8230; that lead to bigger ones.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I was so dry, she held a water glass to my lips</em><br />\n<em>Well the polish on her nail was chipped</em><br />\n<em>She said she had a boyfriend I reminded her of</em><br />\n<em>His hair was the same muddy brown</em><br />\n<em>She stuck her tongue in my mouth</em></p>\n<p>Because sometimes you just don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re going to do until you do it.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure this isn&#8217;t anybody&#8217;s favorite Springsteen song.
