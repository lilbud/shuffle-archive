Sometime in the autumn of 1979, at his home in Holmdel, Bruce recorded this little ditty:

What’s it about?

I don’t know!

Sorry, I couldn’t resist. But seriously, I’m not even sure that Bruce knew what it was about. “I Don’t Know” sounds more a melody in search of lyrics. What few lines are intelligible are almost certainly bluffed. Bruce does this often when working on a song–he warps (and sometimes warps) a melody around a turn of phrase that he particularly likes. Sometimes it reflects the heart of the song, other times its just a hook, and I suspect in this case it’s the latter.

“I Don’t Know” doesn’t appear to have evolved into any finished, released Springsteen song–none to which I can trace a genealogical link, anyway.

Might there be a finished version of the song somewhere in the vault?

Perhaps, but baby…
