Very rarely do I second-guess his arrangement decisions, but when I first heard Bruce’s studio version of “[Long Walk Home](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/03/21/roll-of-the-dice-long-walk-home/)” on *Magic* after first hearing him debut it on the Seeger Sessions Tour, I couldn’t mask my disappointment.

“Long Walk Home” isn’t a rocker. At least it shouldn’t be–at heart it’s a torch song (albeit a political one) about a relationship sorely damaged but holding, a couple rocked by infidelity but determined to recommit themselves.

British jazz singer Barb Jungr understands that. She’s frequently covered Bruce in the studio and on stage, so it’s clear she’s a fan of his work. But with her cover of “Long Walk Home,” she shows an even deeper appreciation, bringing the nostalgia and wistfulness of the song’s soul to the surface through a stunning acoustic arrangement centered around Laurence Hobgood on piano.

Jungr released her version of “Long Walk Home” on her 2016 album, *Shelter From the Storm.* Pick up the track as a free download [here](https://www.linnrecords.com/recording-shelter-storm), and check out more of her music (including more Springsteen covers) [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkTwih4nR7s).
