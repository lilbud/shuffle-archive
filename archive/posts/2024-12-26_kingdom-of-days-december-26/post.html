<p><strong>2017: </strong>Patti Scialfa is sick with the flu and cannot perform, throwing a monkey wrench into the <em>Springsteen on Broadway </em>storyline and set list. Bruce adapts by changing that part of the show to focus on his kids instead of his wife, and accordingly, “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/06/19/roll-of-the-dice-long-time-comin/">Long Time Comin’</a>” makes its first appearance in the show, in the spot where “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/08/08/roll-of-the-dice-tougher-than-the-rest/">Tougher Than the Rest</a>” would normally be. Bruce also swaps out “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/02/06/roll-of-the-dice-brilliant-disguise/">Brilliant Disguise</a>” for “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/10/17/roll-of-the-dice-the-ghost-of-tom-joad/">The Ghost of Tom Joad</a>,” giving added weight to the segment on his social values.</p>
