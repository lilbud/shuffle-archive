**1972:** Mike Appel arranges an unusual publicity event for Bruce and his band–at the chapel of the Ossining Correctional Facility (otherwise known as Sing Sing Prison), where Bruce's grandfather had once served a three-year sentence. Bruce plays a set of covers that at one point even involves an inmate joining the band. That night, Bruce and the band drive back to New York City to play *another* two shows–this time at Kenny's Castaways. Former *Crawdaddy* editor Greg Mitchell is in attendance at both venues; watch his account of that day below.

"New York City Serenade," and the work-in-progress "Jungleland."
