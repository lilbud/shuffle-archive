Some of the holdbacks have escaped into the wild, though, and one of the most compelling is &#8220;Fugitive&#8217;s Dream.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Fugitive&#8217;s Dream&#8221; has a lot of shared DNA with &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/09/12/roll-of-the-dice-unsatisfied-heart/\">Unsatisfied Heart</a>,&#8221; another contemporaneous outtake, and I strongly recommend that you read my essay on that song for more of the backstory and comparison between the two.</p>\n<p>But while &#8220;Unsatisfied Heart&#8221; may be the catchier and more well-known of the sibling outtakes, &#8220;Fugitive&#8217;s Dream&#8221; is the one that will haunt you long after you listen to it.</p>\n<p>So go ahead&#8211;give it a listen, and then we&#8217;ll break it down.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - FUGITIVE&#039;S DREAM\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/w2YYSG4MyjE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;Fugitive&#8217;s Dream&#8221; is nothing short of stunning. If not for the date stamp on the recording (early 1983), one might naturally assume that the song and the recording hail from Bruce&#8217;s <em>Nebraska</em> period. It&#8217;s certainly as dark, brave, and fully realized as any of the classics from Bruce&#8217;s 1982 landmark album.</p>\n<p>Like &#8220;Unsatisfied Heart,&#8221; we open with a classic Springsteen introduction. In &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/01/22/roll-of-the-dice-downbound-train/\">Downbound Train</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/07/24/roll-of-the-dice-dead-man-walkin/\">Dead Man Walkin&#8217;,</a>&#8221; Bruce would reduce it to &#8220;I had a job, I had a girl; I had something going, Mister, in this world.&#8221; Here, however, it&#8217;s:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Sir, I am a pilgrim and a stranger in this land</em><br />\n<em>Once I had a home here, my salvation was at hand</em><br />\n<em>I lived in a fine home, I was respected and satisfied</em><br />\n<em>I had two beautiful children and a kind and loving wife</em></p>\n<p>The second verse is almost identical to &#8220;Unsatisfied Heart&#8221; as well, until the last line, where we get the foreboding sense that &#8220;Fugitive&#8217;s Dream&#8221; is travelling an even darker path.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Then one day a man came to town, a man with nothing and nowhere to go</em><br />\n<em>He came to my door and mentioned something I&#8217;d done a long time ago</em><br />\n<em>I allowed him into my home on his vow that nothing would be said</em><br />\n<em>One night I rose from a dreamless sleep and I went to his bed</em></p>\n<p>In &#8220;Unsatisfied Heart,&#8221; the narrator is equally disturbed by the mysterious visitor&#8217;s blackmail threat. But in that song, the narrator swallows his panic and tries to reconcile his secret past with his new life; in &#8220;Fugitive&#8217;s Dream,&#8221; the narrator decides to take action&#8211;for a frightening moment, at least:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I watched as he lay sleeping, I reached out and touched his cheek</em><br />\n<em>Felt a chill run through my bones, and I fled into the street</em></p>\n<p>Unable to follow through with his urge to kill the threat in his home, he runs. And if he ever comes back, we never find out.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I woke up in a motel room with the light rushin&#8217; in</em><br />\n<em>Like someone had thrust open a door and closed it tight again</em><br />\n<em>I tried to understand why I felt these things that I felt</em><br />\n<em>And why I walked these streets at night a stranger to myself</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Last night the same dream keeps coming around</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;m standing high in the green hills looking across to the outskirts of town</em><br />\n<em>The night air fills my lungs, the wind sweeps around me so strong</em><br />\n<em>Stars rise in a black endless sky, grow brighter and brighter then gone, gone, gone</em></p>\n<p>That last verse is identical to &#8220;Unsatisfied Heart&#8221; as well&#8211;at least most of it is. Even if the narrator of &#8220;Unsatisfied Heart&#8221; is never fully able to answer the question posed in the song&#8217;s refrain (&#8220;Can you live with an unsatisfied heart?&#8221;) the memory that haunts him is one of love and peace.</p>\n<p>Here, however, it&#8217;s not just the distant past that the narrator must now carry as a burden&#8211;it&#8217;s the knowledge that he came close to killing a man to keep his secret buried. And while it&#8217;s true that he ultimately didn&#8217;t go through with it, the songwriter hardly sees that as a victory. The dimming stars symbolize the encroaching darkness in the narrator&#8217;s soul and foretell a future that is anything but peaceful.</p>\n<p><strong>Fugitive&#8217;s Dream</strong><br />\n<strong>Recorded:</strong> January-March 1983<br />\n<strong>Never released</strong><br />\n<strong>Never performed</strong></p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
