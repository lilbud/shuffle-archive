<p>You might be more familiar with “Zip a Dee Doo Dah” in its original Disney incarnation, but in 1963, it went all the way to #8 on the charts when Bob B. Soxx and The Blue Jeans covered it. And if you’re not familiar with that  band, you’re probably familiar with their featured vocalist on the track: Darlene Love.</p>

<p>In 2011, Darlene Love was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and “Zip a Dee Doo Dah” was among the songs she performed at the induction ceremony.</p>
<p>Bruce showed up to play lead guitar for Darlene (and that’s Curtis King on backing vocals)–resulting in one-off performance of an unexpected cover.</p>
