<p>I try to keep a rotating spotlight on fresh new cover artists here, but every once in a while an artist earns a second look.</p>
<p>Today makes the first time I’ve featured a three-peat, however. That’s because Los Angeles-based funk combo Scary Pockets is just <em>so</em> darn good, and it seems like every year at this time they gift us with a creative take on one of Bruce Springsteen’s classic songs.</p>
<p>First, there was their <a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/12/01/cover-me-scary-pockets-and-darren-criss-dancing-in-the-dark/">incredibly cool cover</a> of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/12/25/roll-of-the-dice-dancing-in-the-dark/">Dancing in the Dark</a>,” featuring Darrin Criss on lead vocals back in 2019. Then there was the time Rett Madison fronted <a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/11/10/cover-me-scary-pockets-im-on-fire/">an infectiously danceable version</a> of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/09/11/roll-of-the-dice-im-on-fire/">I’m on Fire</a>” last year.</p>
<p>Today, Swatkins and Therese Curatolo front the band for a funky cover of a cover–Manfred Mann’s version of Bruce’s “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2023/01/01/roll-of-the-dice-blinded-by-the-light/">Blinded by the Light</a>.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZMP_HrAwCg">Watch on Youtube: Blinded by the Light | Bruce Springsteen | funk cover ft. Swatkins &amp; Therese Curatolo</a></p>
<p>The group tips their hat to Bruce for the original, but it’s clear they take their inspiration from Manfred Mann’s adaptation, which went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1977. And it works perfectly, quickly settling into a irresistible groove.</p>
<p>Scary Pockets is headed out on tour across the U.S. and Canada next month, and with at least three Springsteen songs in their repertoire you might hear a familiar song or two if you catch them in person. Check out their tour schedule <a href="https://www.scarypocketsfunk.com/">here</a>.</p>
