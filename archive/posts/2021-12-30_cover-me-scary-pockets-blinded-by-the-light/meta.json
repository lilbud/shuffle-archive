That&#8217;s because Los Angeles-based funk combo Scary Pockets is just <em>so</em> darn good, and it seems like every year at this time they gift us with a creative take on one of Bruce Springsteen&#8217;s classic songs.</p>\n<p>First, there was their <a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/12/01/cover-me-scary-pockets-and-darren-criss-dancing-in-the-dark/\">incredibly cool cover</a> of &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/12/25/roll-of-the-dice-dancing-in-the-dark/\">Dancing in the Dark</a>,&#8221; featuring Darrin Criss on lead vocals back in 2019. Then there was the time Rett Madison fronted <a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/11/10/cover-me-scary-pockets-im-on-fire/\">an infectiously danceable version</a> of &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/09/11/roll-of-the-dice-im-on-fire/\">I&#8217;m on Fire</a>&#8221; last year.</p>\n<p>Today, Swatkins and Therese Curatolo front the band for a funky cover of a cover&#8211;Manfred Mann&#8217;s version of Bruce&#8217;s &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2023/01/01/roll-of-the-dice-blinded-by-the-light/\">Blinded by the Light</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Blinded by the Light | Bruce Springsteen | funk cover ft.

And it works perfectly, quickly settling into a irresistible groove.</p>\n<p>Scary Pockets is headed out on tour across the U.S. and Canada next month, and with at least three Springsteen songs in their repertoire you might hear a familiar song or two if you catch them in person.
