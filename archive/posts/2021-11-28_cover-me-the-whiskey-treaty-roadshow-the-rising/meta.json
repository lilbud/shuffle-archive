But the magic happened when Smith, Hanna, and Keane joined forces on stage, along with fellow local artists Chris Merenda and David Tanklefsky.</p>\n<p>Five solo musicians, each with their own bands or careers. They never intended to form a new band together, but they were so caught up by their collaborative chemistry that they knew they couldn&#8217;t leave it a one-night stand.</p>\n<p>So they didn&#8217;t.</p>\n<p>Instead, they took the Whiskey Treaty Festival on the road across Massachusetts on a four-night mini-tour they called The Whiskey Treaty Roadshow. And that might have been it for the quintet, had a filmmaker friend of Hanna named Tim Bradley not captured the experience in a documentary film called <em>The Whiskey Treaty Roadshow </em>that went on to captivate audiences and win national film festival awards in 2015.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"The Whiskey Treaty Roadshow (Short Doc)\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/108612446?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write\"></iframe></div>\n<p>Lots of documentaries have captured the final days of a band. Not many capture the very first.</p>\n<p>Over the last nine years, The Whiskey Treaty Roadshow (now a band named after a film named after a festival) has delighted audiences across the country with their original material and inventive covers.</p>\n<p>In January 2020, weeks before the pandemic shut down the world, The Treaty released their debut studio album, <em>Band Together, </em>featuring The Black Crowes&#8217;s Steve Dorman on drums and Wilco&#8217;s Pat Sansone on bass. The album&#8217;s debut single, &#8220;Don&#8217;t Cross My Land,&#8221; made\u00a0<em>Rolling Stone&#8217;s</em> &#8220;Ten Best Country and Americana Songs to Hear Right Now&#8221; that month.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Don&#039;t Cross My Land\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mFcXfjpmKRM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>And then the world stopped.</p>\n<p>But the Treaty kept going. As 2020 gave way to 2021, the band live-streamed a benefit concert for the Berkshire Community Action Council that replaced income lost by local service industry professionals during the pandemic. The event&#8217;s theme was\u00a0<em>Recovered</em>, and the set featured a collection of well-known rock classics from &#8220;The Sound of Silence&#8221; to &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/04/01/matr-bruce-springsteen-and-arcade-fire-keep-the-car-running/\">Keep the Car Running</a>,&#8221; recast in the band&#8217;s own style, streamed live with wonderful production values.</p>\n<p>One of the songs on the set list that night was a beautiful banjo-inflected cover of Bruce Springsteen&#8217;s &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/11/21/roll-of-the-dice-the-rising/\">The Rising.</a>&#8221; In an affecting performance, each of the five singers gets a turn in the spotlight, and each makes the most of it while the others harmonize as the song builds towards its climax.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"The Whiskey Treaty Roadshow - &quot;The Rising&quot; (Bruce Springsteen cover) | &#039;Recovered&#039; Live Benefit\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ex1MopAsPuw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Unlike Bruce&#8217;s original, The Treaty&#8217;s version of &#8220;The Rising&#8221; is more reflective than\u00a0 defiant, with veins of loss and resilience running through it to powerful effect.
