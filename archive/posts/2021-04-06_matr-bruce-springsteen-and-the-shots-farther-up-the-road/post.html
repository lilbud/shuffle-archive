<p>I think we’re gonna have to take this one on faith.</p>
<p>On the night of September 4, 1977, Bruce Springsteen made an unannounced guest appearance at The Stone Pony with the club’s new house band, The Shots.</p>
<p>Taking the baton from from Southside Johnny and The Asbury Jukes, The Shots were led by lead guitarist Billy Hector, who has a Springsteen recording credit to his name: we can hear him on Bruce’s 2009 “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/05/14/roll-of-the-dice-cover-me-clarence-clemons-savin-up/">Savin’ Up</a>” duet with John Luraschi on Luraschi’s <em>The End of the Road</em> album.</p>

<p>Bruce played two songs with The Shots that night, the first of which was a cover of “Farther Up the Road” (not to be confused with Bruce’s similarly named song) by Bobby “Blue” Bland.</p>

<p>“Farther Up the Road” is a classic Texas blues shuffle from 1957 and one of Bland’s best-known songs, which might have at least a little to do with Eric Clapton’s frequent covers of it.</p>

<p>Bruce’s cover with The Shots owes more to Clapton’s arrangement than Bland’s original, but like I said above: we’ll have to take it on faith that they’re actually playing “Farther Up the Road.”</p>
<p>It certainly sounds like it, and I can make out the title phrase a couple of times, but the recording is so distant and muffled that I can’t make out any of the other lyrics clearly.</p>

<p>It certainly sounds to me like Bruce is ad libbing quite a bit (as is his wont), so it’s too bad we don’t have a clear recording to appreciate.</p>
<p>Still, this remains the only time to date that Bruce has covered this early Texas blues standard.</p>
