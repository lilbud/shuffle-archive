Who wouldn&#8217;t find solace in the notion that life brings its share of joy and grief in turns? Especially when you&#8217;re in a valley, it&#8217;s nice to know another peak awaits you somewhere out there.</p>\n<p>But in the late 1950s, Seeger sensed that a war-weary America needed a bit more reassurance, and he added six important words of his own:\u00a0<em>I swear it&#8217;s not too late.</em></p>\n<p>In the interview below, Seeger tells Alec Wilkinson how he approached writing the song.</p>\n<div id=\"v-gykVzi7A-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='566' src='https://videopress.com/embed/gykVzi7A?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>Pete&#8217;s own version sat in the vault for a while, though. The first recording of &#8220;To Everything There Is a Season&#8221; (as it was originally called) to reach listeners&#8217; ears was by an American folk group called The Limeliters in 1962.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Limeliters - Turn! Turn! Turn!

Jim was particularly taken with Seeger&#8217;s song, and the following year he arranged it for folk singer Judy Collins, who retitled it &#8220;Turn! Turn! Turn! (To Everything There Is a Season)&#8221; and released it on her <em>Judy Collins 3</em> album in 1963.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Turn, Turn, Turn! / To Everything There Is a Season\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Op_zQlr_aEg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>A year later, McGuinn teamed up with fellow folk musicians Gene Clark and David Crosby and formed a group called The Jet Set. The trio added Michael Clarke and Chris Hillman to their line-up later in the year, and by Thanksgiving, they&#8217;d renamed themselves The Byrds.</p>\n<p>The Byrds scored their two biggest hits during their first year together. Their first and biggest came right out of the gate: a cover of Bob Dylan&#8217;s &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/12/28/matr-bruce-springsteen-and-roger-mcguinn-mr-tambourine-man/\">Mr. Tambourine Man</a>&#8221; released in April 1965 that went to #1 in both the U.S. and U.K.</p>\n<p>As the band was touring that summer, McGuinn&#8217;s future wife Dolores asked Jim to play Seeger&#8217;s song (which by that point was a folk standard) on the tour bus. McGuinn obliged, but by that point in his career his instincts were more rock than folk, and the resulting hybrid arrangement immediately struck the band as a potential hit.</p>\n<p>The Byrds recorded their version of &#8220;Turn! Turn! Turn!&#8221; (now completely dropping its original title) in early September and released it as a single on October 1st. It was a smash hit, topping the charts in the U.S. and Canada, and it became a perennial standard in rock as well as folk.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"The Byrds - Turn!

And in the 21st century, Bruce Springsteen paid tribute to each of them.</p>\n<p>Bruce&#8217;s first performance of &#8220;Turn! Turn! Turn!&#8217; was (appropriately) with the Seeger Sessions Band in 2006, performed as a duet with Marc Anthony Thompson at a rehearsal show for the band&#8217;s upcoming tour.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Turn!
