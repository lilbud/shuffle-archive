<p>Okay, I know I already featured a track from Kevin Heider’s outstanding new Springsteen tribute album, <em>Ohio, </em>a few months ago–I called <a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/10/30/cover-me-kevin-heider-my-lucky-day/">Heider’s cover </a>of “<a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/09/02/roll-of-the-dice-my-lucky-day/">My Lucky Day</a>” the album’s standout track, and I meant it.</p>
<p>But Heider just released a new video to accompany his cover of “<a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/06/01/roll-of-the-dice-if-i-should-fall-behind/">If I Should Fall Behind</a>,” and it’s easily the album’s standout video (and probably one of the best artistic video covers of a Springsteen song).</p>
<p>If you can make it through Heider’s touching video without it bringing a smile to your face, a tear to your eye, and a lump in your throat… well then, I don’t know what it would take to move you.</p>

<p>Heider’s video universalizes Bruce’s song into a celebration of the bonds between husband and wife, parent and child, and even siblings.</p>
<p>And that last shot… just perfect.</p>
<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/95881680">Bonus</a>: here’s a more traditional performance video of Heider’s cover–it’s another great performance but it doesn’t pack the emotional punch of his video version.</p>
