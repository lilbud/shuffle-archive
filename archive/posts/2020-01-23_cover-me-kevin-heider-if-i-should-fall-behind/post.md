Okay, I know I already featured a track from Kevin Heider's outstanding new Springsteen tribute album, *Ohio,* a few months ago–I called [Heider's cover](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/10/30/cover-me-kevin-heider-my-lucky-day/)of "[My Lucky Day](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/09/02/roll-of-the-dice-my-lucky-day/)" the album's standout track, and I meant it.

But Heider just released a new video to accompany his cover of "[If I Should Fall Behind](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/06/01/roll-of-the-dice-if-i-should-fall-behind/)," and it's easily the album's standout video (and probably one of the best artistic video covers of a Springsteen song).

If you can make it through Heider's touching video without it bringing a smile to your face, a tear to your eye, and a lump in your throat... well then, I don't know what it would take to move you.

Heider's video universalizes Bruce's song into a celebration of the bonds between husband and wife, parent and child, and even siblings.

And that last shot... just perfect.
