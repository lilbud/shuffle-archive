<p>In 1982, Jack Nicholson and Harvey Keitel starred in a film about a corrupt U.S. border agent. The film received middling reviews and is arguably most memorable for its soundtrack, which featured songs written by Ry Cooder.</p>
<p>One of Cooder’s songs played over both the opening and end credits: a bittersweet ballad called “Across the Borderline,” performed by Freddy Fender.</p>

<p>“Across the Borderline” features such a lovely melody and such uplifting verses (they inspired two of Bruce’s own songs, “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/09/06/roll-of-the-dice-across-the-border/">Across the Border</a>” and “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/01/10/roll-of-the-dice-american-land/">American Land</a>“) that it’s easy to miss the fact that the choruses offer a hard dose of reality.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>When you reach the broken promised land</em><br/>
<em>Every dream slips through your hand</em><br/>
<em>And you know that it’s too late to change your mind</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>‘Cause you’ve paid the price to come this far</em><br/>
<em>Just to wind up where you are</em><br/>
<em>And you’re still just across the borderline</em></p>
<p>At first listen, “Across the Borderline” sounds like a strange candidate for offering hope and fortitude. A border is just a line, it seems to say, and the grass on the other side may not be any greener until you water it a good long time.</p>

<p>But that’s Cooder’s point: crossing a border may lead you to a better place, but you’ve still got to work to make it a better life. And understanding that from the start can help you commit or re-commit to making it to the actual promised land.</p>
<p>So maybe that explains why “Across the Borderline” turned up in Bruce Springsteen’s otherwise romantic-themed set lists during the early days of the Tunnel of Love Tour. He’d been soundchecking it for a while, but in late April of 1988, Bruce finally added it to the main set, sandwiched by songs about desire and fidelity.</p>

<p>Because what else is “Across the Borderline” about if not the desire for a better life and the fidelity to that dream–no matter what it takes to realize it?</p>
<p>Bruce played it four times that spring; he played it another four times on the tour after that, five years later.</p>

<p>But in between, he gifted us with two very special versions on the evenings of November 16 and 17, 1990.</p>
<p>At a pair of benefit concerts for The Christic Institute, Bruce closed each show with a stunningly beautiful performance of “Across the Borderline,” performed as a duet with fellow headliner Jackson Browne on piano and accompanied by the great Bonnie Raitt on slide guitar and backing vocals.</p>
<p>All three icons were in peak form that night, their voices and instruments blending sublimely–a perfect ending for two wonderful concerts that are essential for any fan’s collection. (Thankfully, they’re part of Bruce’s official archive series–get them <a href="https://live.brucespringsteen.net/live-music/0,14250/Bruce-Springsteen-mp3-flac-download-11-16-1990-The-Christic-Shows-at-The-Shrine-Los-Angeles-CA.html">here</a>.)</p>

<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> Bruce played “Across the Borderline” only once more after his 1993 World Tour, in Denver on the Wrecking Ball Tour nineteen years later. With the full E Street Band behind him, he dedicated the song to a woman who told him his music had helped her make it through a hard time. It was an unexpected choice to be sure, but an incredibly moving one as well. Enjoy.</p>
