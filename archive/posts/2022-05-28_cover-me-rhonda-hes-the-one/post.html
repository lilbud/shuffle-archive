<p>You know the rule: Do it better, or do it different.</p>
<p>When it comes to this gender-flipped version of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/04/04/roll-of-the-dice-shes-the-one/">She’s the One</a>” by the U.K. disco duo Rhonda… well, it’s different.</p>

<p>That clip is from 1978, the same  year that Rhonda released “He’s the One” as an A-side single. Presumably it was a stop on their promotional media tour, although it failed to lift the disc up the charts. (The audience doesn’t seem all that into it either, although the front-and-center couple sure give it the old college try.)</p>
<p>We should give Rhonda props, though. This was 1978 after all, when Springsteen covers were not yet commonplace, and certainly not a deep cut like this one.</p>
<p>For that reason alone, it never quite disappears, surfacing from time to time on tribute albums and cover compilations. So if you want to chase down the original studio track, it’s out there… or you can just listen to it below.</p>
