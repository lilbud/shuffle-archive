The song&#8217;s narrator keeps constant watch against an unseen threat, and any less than-friendly reception might become more sinister in the dead of night, like the man who slew Preacher Casey in Steinbeck&#8217;s novel.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Have you seen that vigilante man?</em><br />\n<em>Have you seen that vigilante man?</em><br />\n<em>Have you seen that vigilante man?</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;ve been hearin&#8217; his name all over the land</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well what is a vigilante man?</em><br />\n<em>Tell me, what is a vigilante man?</em><br />\n<em>Has he got a gun and a club in his hand?</em><br />\n<em>Is that a vigilante man?</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Rainy night down in the engine house</em><br />\n<em>Sleepin&#8217; just as still as a mouse</em><br />\n<em>Man come along and he chased us out in the rain</em><br />\n<em>Was that a vigilante man?</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Stormy days, we pass the time away</em><br />\n<em>Sleeping in some good warm place</em><br />\n<em>Man come along and we give him a little race</em><br />\n<em>Was that a vigilante man?</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Preacher Casey was just a working man</em><br />\n<em>And he said, &#8220;Unite, all you working men&#8221;</em><br />\n<em>Killed him in the river, some strange man</em><br />\n<em>Was that a vigilante man?</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Oh why does a vigilante man</em><br />\n<em>Why does a vigilante man</em><br />\n<em>Carry that sawed-off shotgun in his hand?</em><br />\n<em>Would he shoot his brother and sister down?</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I rambled &#8217;round from town to town</em><br />\n<em>I rambled &#8217;round from town to town</em><br />\n<em>And they herded us around like a wild herd of cattle</em><br />\n<em>Was that the vigilante men?</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Have you seen that vigilante man?</em><br />\n<em>Have you seen that vigilante man?</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;ve heard his name all over the land</em></p>\n<p>Years before Bruce recorded\u00a0<em>The Ghost of Tom Joad</em>, he was taken enough with Guthrie&#8217;s sequel (side-quel?) to record it with the E Street Band sometime between completing his <em>Tunnel of Love\u00a0</em>album and embarking on the tour.</p>\n<!--[if lt IE 9]><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\">document.createElement('audio');</script><![endif]-->\n<audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-29312-1\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/13-Vigilante-Man-Bruce-Springsteen-online-audio-converter.com_.mp3?_=1\" /><a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/13-Vigilante-Man-Bruce-Springsteen-online-audio-converter.com_.mp3\">https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/13-Vigilante-Man-Bruce-Springsteen-online-audio-converter.com_.mp3</a></audio>\n<p>Bruce&#8217;s version leverages Guthrie&#8217;s lyrics, but he drops the verses that date the song to the Dust Bowl era. That simple omission makes the song resonate with contemporary urgency&#8211;it could have been written about the plight of the homeless and the dangers they face on the city streets.</p>\n<p>Musically, though, Bruce completely reinvents the song as a taut, suspenseful rocker. Listen with your eyes closed and you&#8217;ll see the narrator hiding and darting in the shadows, you&#8217;ll bear witness to violent scenes choreographed to Bruce&#8217;s guitar solo.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a terrific E Street Band recording, and the last one before Bruce put the band on hiatus. Yet it&#8217;s one of Bruce&#8217;s most under-the-radar tracks, with many fans unaware of its existence even though it merited an official music video, too.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Vigilante Man\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eKXILNMXxs0?start=2&#038;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>That video was filmed at a soundcheck at Madison Square Garden on May 19, 1988.
