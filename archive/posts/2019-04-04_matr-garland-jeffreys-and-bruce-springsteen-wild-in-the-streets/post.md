Garland Jeffreys and Bruce Springsteen started writing and performing around the same time, and they each released their first records in 1973. Garland’s first hit that year was “Wild in the Streets,” a gritty song about street crime.

Garland and Bruce have performed it together on four occasions, and one of those was Bruce’s holiday show in Asbury Park, December 7, 2003. (Yes, it’s a strange selection for a holiday show.)

Here’s that performance from Garland and Bruce, backed by the Max Weinberg 7.

Not bad, but IMO, it doesn’t hold a candle to the original:
