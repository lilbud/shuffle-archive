<p>Bruce Springsteen was scheduled to kick off the European leg of the original River Tour a mere twelve days after wrapping the first North American leg, but by the end of that first leg in March 1981, Bruce was exhausted.</p>
<p>His shows had reached and passed the four-hour mark (intermissions included), and he and the band gave their all each and every night. The man desperately needed a break, and so reluctantly the first twelves shows of the European leg were rescheduled to give Bruce a solid month to rest and rejuvenate.</p>
<p>For Bruce, though, resting up included more songwriting, and several home demos recorded during Bruce’s month-long respite escaped into the wild.</p>
<p>Just a few months later, Bruce’s songwriting would turn dark, leading him to his next landmark album, <em>Nebraska. </em>But in the spring of 1981, Bruce was still very much in River mode, and several of the songs he wrote are surprisingly light and poppy.  (See “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/07/12/roll-of-the-dice-riding-horse/">Riding Horse</a>,” for example.)</p>
<p>Perhaps the most charming song-that-never-was from this period is a confection known as “My Heart Is an Open Book.”</p>

<p>Employing a similar conceit to Bruce’s much-much-later composition “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/06/07/roll-of-the-dice-seven-angels/">Seven Angels,</a>” “My Heart Is an Open Book” contrasts a transparently steadfast lover with the inscrutable object of his affection.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>You won’t say what you need</em><br/>
<em>You won’t say what you want</em><br/>
<em>You just stand in the corner</em><br/>
<em>Baby so nonchalant</em><br/>
<em>When you stand around, I try to keep my cool</em><br/>
<em>But my heart’s an open book for you</em></p>
<p>Enter the gimmick: For the rest of the song (such as it is, it doesn’t appear that Bruce ever finished developing it), Bruce employs the time-tested Book of Love metaphor to illustrate and communicate how his love has formed and deepened. Like most relationships, the first chapters are sunny and bright:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Well baby, late at night you read Chapter One</em><br/>
<em>We’re going out, we’re having fun</em><br/>
<em>You read on up to Chapter Two</em><br/>
<em>There’s a story of my love for you</em></p>
<p>But of course, over time conflict sets in–and in times of strife, Bruce encourages his love to rely on the good book:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Well, I don’t care what you say and do</em><br/>
<em>You stay angry and I talk it through</em><br/>
<em>Yeah it don’t matter baby, I’m not a fool</em><br/>
<em>Cause my heart is an open book to you</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>You’re readin’ up baby, to Chapter Three</em><br/>
<em>It tells you how good our love could be</em><br/>
<em>You’re readin’ on up to Chapter Four</em><br/>
<em>Well I kiss you once and then I want some more</em><br/>
<em>You read on now to chapter Five</em><br/>
<em>??? all right</em></p>
<p>Bruce’s lyrics are unclear here at times–perhaps bluffed, even–but this is a pretty good approximation. Thankfully, “My Heart Is an Open Book” is such a pure pop song that the exact lyrics almost don’t matter–this is a song that wears its heart on its sleeve. Or as Bruce sings:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Yeah it don’t matter what I do because</em><br/>
<em>My heart is an open book to you</em></p>
