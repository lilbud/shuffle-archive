<p>By now, we shouldn’t be surprised at the range of covers Bruce Springsteen is prone to playing in concert.</p>
<p>Still, “Hey, Good Lookin’,” Hank Williams’ #1 country hit from 1951, seems like one of the least likely contenders. (It’s certainly tough to imagine a fan bringing a sign for it.)</p>

<p>Bruce did play it live, though–one time only–and it wasn’t even on the Seeger Sessions Tour where one might expect it.</p>
<p>Nope, this one was in Asbury Park, at Bruce’s last show of the 20th century.</p>
<p>I wrote about that show last month when I shared Bruce’s soundchecked cover of another Hank Williams song, “<a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/09/14/cover-me-jambalaya-on-the-bayou/">Jambalaya (On the Bayou)</a>.” Bruce’s cover of “Hey Good Lookin'” comes from the same rehearsal–in fact, it immediately followed “Jambalaya,” making for a Hank Williams double-header.</p>
<p>It’s more than a bit loose and messy, but that’s part of the charm. Take a listen to Bruce, Patti, Garry, Nils, Soozie, Lisa Lowell, and Southside Johnny on the harp having a ball and falling all over themselves:</p>
