<p>Curtis Mayfield may have had much bigger hits than “Gypsy Woman,” but “Gypsy Woman” is the track that paved the way for them.</p>
<p>Mayfield wrote “Gypsy Woman” after becoming the lead singer for The Impressions. Peaking at #20 on the Top 100 and stopping just short of the top spot on the R&amp;B chart, the 1961 song became the first of a string of hits for Mayfield and the group.</p>

<p>In 1970, Brian Hyland covered “Gypsy Woman” in a dreamlike arrangement and took the song even higher up the Top 100, peaking at #3.</p>

<p>In 1993, when asked to contribute a track to an upcoming Curtis Mayfield tribute album, Bruce chose “Gypsy Woman” as his contribution. Recorded in his home studio, the track features a prominent Tommy Sims (a recent alum of Bruce’s 1992-93 touring band) on bass, keyboards, percussion, backing vocals, and the Hammond B-3.</p>

<p>Bruce’s version retains the mysterious atmosphere of Mayfield’s original and adds just a hint of danger. It’s a fine addition to Springsteen’s officially released catalog.</p>
<p>Although Bruce has never performed “Gypsy Woman” live in full, he did give us a taste of it at the Grammy Awards in 1994, when he sang it as part of a Mayfield medley with Bonnie Raitt, B.B. King, Steve Winwood and others. Take a look–you’ll find the song at around the 3:19 mark below.</p>
