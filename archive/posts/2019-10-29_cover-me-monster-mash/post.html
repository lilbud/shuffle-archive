<p>Oy, what a mess.</p>
<p>Bruce has spoiled us in recent years–we’re now used to him attempting covers of songs he’s never played before and hitting them out of the park.</p>
<p>But on Halloween night on the Wrecking Ball Tour… well, at least he got on base. I think.</p>
<p>We gotta give Bruce some points though: first, because he anticipated the request and worked it up at soundcheck; second for taking a chance with an unusual arrangement; and third for never once wavering in his commitment.</p>
<p>The occasion was captured in terrific audio and HD multi-cam quality, so enjoy Bruce Springsteen and The E Street Band covering Bobby Pickett’s 1962 novelty hit, “Monster Mash,” for the first and only time.</p>

<p>Yeah, that reggae arrangement doesn’t really do the song any favors. Bruce realizes it a couple of minutes into the song but does his game best to carry it to conclusion.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, though, he compensates with shtick. He obviously didn’t rehearse that Transylvania accent, and that ad libbed “Boss Man” reference caught the band so off-guard that more than one back-up singer stepped on his line.</p>
<p>Still, it was great fun–and isn’t that the point of a novelty song?  And when it comes to hamming it up to “Monster Mash,” it’s pretty tough to beat the original artist:</p>

<p>“Monster Mash” was a huge hit around Halloween when it was originally released, and it’s been a seasonal favorite ever since–so maybe it’s not out of the question for Bruce to give it another shot someday.</p>
<p>Let’s just hope he chooses a different arrangement.</p>
