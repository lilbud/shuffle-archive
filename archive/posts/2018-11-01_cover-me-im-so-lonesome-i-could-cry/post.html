<p>Hank Williams had a considerable influence on Bruce’s music, so it’s not surprising that Bruce has covered so many of his songs. And yet one of Williams’ best-known songs–“I’m So Lonesome I Could Cry” remains <em>officially</em> uncovered by Bruce, even through a wide array of artists from Johnny Cash to Keb Mo to Cowboy Junkies to Al Green has taken a swing at it.</p>

<p>Now, I’m not sure who makes the rules for what’s official and what isn’t, but Bruce did in fact soundcheck the song on at least three occasions back in 1988 on the Tunnel of Love Tour.</p>
<p>What a great addition “I’m So Lonesome I Could Cry” would have made to those Tunnel of Love setlists, but unfortunately it never made it from soundcheck to showtime.</p>
<p>We do have one surviving audio document of Bruce performing it, however, from his soundcheck at the Shoreline Amphitheater in Mountain View on May 3, 1988. It’s brief, incomplete, but clear and lovely–so take a listen to the only known recording of Bruce covering this American country classic from 1949.</p>
