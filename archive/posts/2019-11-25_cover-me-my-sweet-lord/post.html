<p>George Harrison passed away just a week after Thanksgiving in 2001, so when Bruce kicked off his first holiday show of the year a few days later in Asbury Park, before delving into seasonal favorites he started with a pair of tributes to the late, great musician.</p>
<p>First out of the gate was Harrison’s Beatles classic, “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/12/28/cover-me-something/">Something</a>.” The second song of the night was Harrison’s greatest hit: “My Sweet Lord,” which topped charts around the world in 1971. (It also generated a fair amount of controversy, thanks to a bit of unintentional copyright infringement, but that’s a story for another day and a different blog.)</p>

<p>Bruce’s one-time-only cover featured a gentle acoustic arrangement with backing vocals from Patti, Soozie, and Lisa Lowell.</p>
<p>Bruce concluded with a fond “Lord bless you, George!” before launching into a more traditional holiday set. To date, this was the only time Bruce is known to have performed “My Sweet Lord” in concert.</p>
