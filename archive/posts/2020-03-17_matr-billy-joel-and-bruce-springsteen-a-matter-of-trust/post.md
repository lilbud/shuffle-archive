It’s one of Billy Joel’s greatest hits, cracking the Top 10 (although just barely) in the summer of ’86.

It’s also one of Billy’s best videos, an homage to The Beatles’ classic rooftop concert, and the only video in which he can be seen playing the guitar. (Is that Ringo at 1:38 and Paul at 2:01? You be the judge.)

So when Billy and Bruce joined forces during the last days of the 2008 American presidential campaign to help put Barack Obama over the top, “A Matter of Trust” was a natural candidate for their joint set list.

It turned out to be a great choice–the song is perfectly suited for Bruce’s range and style, and their performance sounds natural and easy, like they’d always been performing it that way.

Still, despite four stage-sharing occasions since, that 2008 performance remains the only time that Bruce has ever performed “A Matter of Trust” to this day.
