Here&#8217;s the first known recording of Bruce performing &#8220;Not Fade Away&#8221; (clearly influenced by The Stones&#8217; version) in the autumn of 1971. It&#8217;s not the best recording, but hoo boy&#8230; that guitar solo!</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen: NOT FADE AWAY WITH A SNIPPET OF BO DIDDLEY&#039;S A GUNSLINGER\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YnaPNnZNTeQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t until the Darkness Tour that Bruce brought &#8220;Not Fade Away&#8221; to the E Street stage, as part of a primal, percussive medley that led seamlessly into &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/04/04/roll-of-the-dice-shes-the-one/\">She&#8217;s the One</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen Not Fade Away Passaic\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y8xv8JtPo3o?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>That medley (often featuring &#8220;Mona,&#8221; &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/03/16/cover-me-gloria/\">Gloria</a>,&#8221; and &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/07/01/roll-of-the-dice-preachers-daughter/\">Preacher&#8217;s Daughter</a>&#8221; as well) was a nightly highlight of the Darkness Tour, but once the tour ended, &#8220;Not Fade Away&#8221; kept a much lower profile.</p>\n<p>Still, the very fact that almost every rock and roll musician worth their salt can play &#8220;Not Fade Away&#8221; makes the song a likely set list candidate for impromptu guest appearances.
