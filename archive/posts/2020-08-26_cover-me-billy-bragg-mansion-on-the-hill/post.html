<p>It’s been a while since we’ve featured a cover from the wonderful 2003 Springsteen tribute compilation, <em>Light of Day. </em></p>
<p><i>Light of Day </i>features a host of names and voices that will be familiar to anyone who’s attended the Asbury Park music festival that goes by the same name, each covering a tune from the Springsteen songbook–some well-known, others obscure.</p>
<p>One of my favorite tracks is Billy Bragg’s Fats Domino-inspired arrangement of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/03/06/roll-of-the-dice-mansion-on-the-hill/">Mansion on the Hill.</a>”</p>

<p>“Mansion on the Hill” is a song steeped in nostalgia, and it’s a tough song to play uptempo without losing that. Bragg figured out a way to do it, though, rooting his band arrangement in the sound of popular music from the time Bruce writes about in the song.</p>
<p>It’s a brilliant concept, and Bragg and The Blokes execute it perfectly.</p>
