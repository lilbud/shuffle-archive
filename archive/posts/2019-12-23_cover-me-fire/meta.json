And as a guitarist, he was already well on his way to earning his &#8220;fastest in the east&#8221; reputation. Unsurprisingly, the band began seeking out material that allowed Bruce to show off his chops, and if you fancied yourself a guitar hero in 1967, there was one idol you couldn&#8217;t help but try and cover.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s probably why The Castiles&#8217; set list on September 16, 1967 featured not just one but two recent releases by The Jimi Hendrix Experience. I shared the latter one, &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/02/19/cover-me-purple-haze/\">Purple Haze</a>&#8221; last year; now here&#8217;s the song The Castiles used to open their show: &#8220;Fire.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"v-qXRi61aA-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='426' src='https://videopress.com/embed/qXRi61aA?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>It&#8217;s not quite as assured a performance at first as &#8220;Purple Haze&#8221; would be a few songs later (perhaps the young lads needed a few songs under their belt to feel fully comfortable), but by the instrumental break, Bruce was on fire.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s amazing to think he was only seventeen at the time.</p>\n<p>As for the Hendrix original, the funk and soul song was released on\u00a0<em>Are You Experienced</em> in 1967, but it would be a few years before &#8220;Fire&#8221; was released as a single&#8211;which means Bruce had probably spent a fair bit of time listening to the complete album in the summer of 1967. It sure showed.</p>\n<audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-15046-3\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Jimi-Hendrix-Let-Me-Light-Your-Fire.mp3?_=3\" /><a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Jimi-Hendrix-Let-Me-Light-Your-Fire.mp3\">http://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Jimi-Hendrix-Let-Me-Light-Your-Fire.mp3</a></audio>\n<p><strong>Fire</strong><br />\n<strong>First performed:</strong> September 16, 1967 (Freehold, NJ)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> September 16, 1967 (Freehold, NJ)</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>One time only: Seventeen-year-old Bruce Springsteen covers Jimi Hendrix&#8217;s &#8220;Fire&#8221; with his high school band, The Castiles.</p>\n", "protected": false}, "author": 1, "featured_media": 15173, "comment_status": "open", "ping_status": "open", "sticky": false, "template": "", "format": "standard", "meta": {"_monsterinsights_skip_tracking": false, "_monsterinsights_sitenote_active": false, "_monsterinsights_sitenote_note": "", "_monsterinsights_sitenote_category": 0, "jetpack_post_was_ever_published": false, "_jetpack_newsletter_access": "", "_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs": false, "_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id": 0, "_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content": false, "_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content": false, "footnotes": "", "jetpack_publicize_message": "", "jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled": true, "jetpack_social_post_already_shared": true, "jetpack_social_options": {"image_generator_settings": {"template": "highway", "default_image_id": 0, "font": "", "enabled": false}, "version": 2}}, "categories": [4], "tags": [257, 2208], "class_list": ["post-15046", "post", "type-post", "status-publish", "format-standard", "has-post-thumbnail", "hentry", "category-cover-me", "tag-fire", "tag-jimi-hendrix-experience"], "aioseo_notices": [], "jetpack_publicize_connections": [], "jetpack_featured_media_url": "https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/fire.jpg?fit=1772%2C1194&ssl=1", "jetpack_sharing_enabled": true, "jetpack_shortlink": "https://wp.me/p9w3Lk-3UG", "jetpack_likes_enabled": true, "jetpack-related-posts": [{"id": 7533, "url": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/02/19/cover-me-purple-haze/", "url_meta": {"origin": 15046, "position": 0}, "title": "Cover Me: Purple Haze", "author": "Ken", "date": "February 19, 2019", "format": false, "excerpt": "Less than three months after it exploded onto the American rock scene, Bruce's high school band opened their show with a passionate cover of Jimi Hendrix's \"Purple Haze.\" Listen to a 17-year-old Bruce Springsteen tear it up inside.", "rel": "", "context": "In &quot;Cover Me&quot;", "block_context": {"text": "Cover Me", "link": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/category/cover-me/"}, "img": {"alt_text": "", "src": "https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/PurpleHazeUK.jpg?fit=500%2C494&ssl=1&resize=350%2C200", "width": 350, "height": 200}, "classes": []}, {"id": 2234, "url": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/05/22/cover-me-san-franciscan-nights/", "url_meta": {"origin": 15046, "position": 1}, "title": "Cover Me: San Franciscan Nights", "author": "Ken", "date": "May 22, 2018", "format": false, "excerpt": "The Castiles perform a contemporaneous cover of Eric Burdon and The Animals' hit, \"San Franciscan Nights.\"", "rel": "", "context": "In &quot;Cover Me&quot;", "block_context": {"text": "Cover Me", "link": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/category/cover-me/"}, "img": {"alt_text": "", "src": "https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/eric-burdon-and-the-animals-san-franciscan-nights-mgm-3-e1526764132965.jpg?fit=600%2C600&ssl=1&resize=350%2C200", "width": 350, "height": 200, "srcset": "https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/eric-burdon-and-the-animals-san-franciscan-nights-mgm-3-e1526764132965.jpg?fit=600%2C600&ssl=1&resize=350%2C200 1x, https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/eric-burdon-and-the-animals-san-franciscan-nights-mgm-3-e1526764132965.jpg?fit=600%2C600&ssl=1&resize=525%2C300 1.5x"}, "classes": []}, {"id": 18300, "url": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/05/16/cover-me-eleanor-rigby/", "url_meta": {"origin": 15046, "position": 2}, "title": "Cover Me: Eleanor Rigby", "author": "Ken", "date": "May 16, 2020", "format": false, "excerpt": "It takes guts to cover The Beatles' orchestral \"Eleanor Rigby\" with just a four-person high school rock band, but Bruce Springsteen has never lacked in the guts department.
