It doesn’t happen often anymore, but when Bruce plays a show on Halloween Eve, you know he’s going to recognize the occasion. Perhaps a rare outing for “[Spirit in the Night](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/03/01/roll-of-the-dice-spirit-in-the-night/),” which opened his 1992 show, or “[A Night With the Jersey Devil](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/05/14/roll-of-the-dice-a-night-with-the-jersey-devil/)” and “[Monster Mash](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/10/29/cover-me-monster-mash/),” both of which made appearances twenty years to the day later.

But on the original River Tour in 1980, Bruce opened his show with a appropriately themed song that he’s never played before or since.

“Haunted House” was first released by blues artist Johnny Fuller in 1959. It branded itself as a novelty record with its demonic laugh bookends, but it was actually a great recording with some terrific guitar-plucking. It had the poor timing of being released a few months *after* Halloween, however, and it failed to chart.

Jumpin’ Gene Simmons had better luck with his cover in 1964. Released shortly *before* Halloween in a more muscular arrangement, it peaked at #11 on the Billboard Hot 100 just in time for the holiday.

It was Simmons’ version that inspired Bruce to cover it at his L.A. Sports Arena show in 1980, and we can tell from the faithful arrangement–right down to Clarence’s perfect spoken-word “Don’t be here when the morning comes!” pulled straight from Simmons’ recording.

A one-time-only cover, “Haunted House” was an unusual choice to open an E Street Band show, but then again Halloween is an unusual night.

Have a spooky holiday and eat lots of candy!
