Perhaps a rare outing for &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/03/01/roll-of-the-dice-spirit-in-the-night/\">Spirit in the Night</a>,&#8221; which opened his 1992 show, or &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/05/14/roll-of-the-dice-a-night-with-the-jersey-devil/\">A Night With the Jersey Devil</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/10/29/cover-me-monster-mash/\">Monster Mash</a>,&#8221; both of which made appearances twenty years to the day later.</p>\n<p>But on the original River Tour in 1980, Bruce opened his show with a appropriately themed song that he&#8217;s never played before or since.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Haunted House&#8221; was first released by blues artist Johnny Fuller in 1959. It branded itself as a novelty record with its demonic laugh bookends, but it was actually a great recording with some terrific guitar-plucking. It had the poor timing of being released a few months <em>after\u00a0</em>Halloween, however, and it failed to chart.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"1st RECORDING OF: Haunted House - Johnny Fuller (1958)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jM10AKk9YH8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Jumpin&#8217; Gene Simmons had better luck with his cover in 1964.
