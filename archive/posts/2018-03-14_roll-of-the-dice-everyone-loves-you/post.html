<p>In case you haven’t figure it out yet, I’m a completist. So when I established that the scope of this blog spans Bruce’s entire catalog of originals and covers, that definition is a bit, um, liberal at times.</p>
<p>Witness today’s dice roll: an unreleased, unfinished (heck, it’s barely started) tune called “Everyone Loves You” in the session notes from Bruce’s home demo recordings, back in early 1979.</p>

<p>This work-in-progress made escaped to the fan community many years ago. Many of Bruce’s discards eventually evolve into or cross-pollinate with other songs that make it to vinyl, but this isn’t one of them.</p>
<p>Best I can tell, it’s an unrequited love song, but it requires some seriously close listening and some imagination to discern that. Of the few lyrics in this brief clip, I can pick out:</p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;"><em>…and if you can’t be mine</em><br/>
<em>give me all that love</em><br/>
<em>and if you want me too</em><br/>
<em>well, everyone loves you</em></p>
<p>If you can make out anything more or different, please let me know.</p>
