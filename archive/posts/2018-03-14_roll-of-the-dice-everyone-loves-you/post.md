In case you haven’t figure it out yet, I’m a completist. So when I established that the scope of this blog spans Bruce’s entire catalog of originals and covers, that definition is a bit, um, liberal at times.

Witness today’s dice roll: an unreleased, unfinished (heck, it’s barely started) tune called “Everyone Loves You” in the session notes from Bruce’s home demo recordings, back in early 1979.

This work-in-progress made escaped to the fan community many years ago. Many of Bruce’s discards eventually evolve into or cross-pollinate with other songs that make it to vinyl, but this isn’t one of them.

Best I can tell, it’s an unrequited love song, but it requires some seriously close listening and some imagination to discern that. Of the few lyrics in this brief clip, I can pick out:

*…and if you can’t be mine*  
*give me all that love*  
*and if you want me too*  
*well, everyone loves you*

If you can make out anything more or different, please let me know.

**Everyone Loves You** (unfinished and unreleased)  
**Recorded**: 1979 (demo)  
**Performed:** Never
