If you only know “[All the Way Home](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/09/08/roll-of-the-dice-all-the-way-home/)” from the *Devils & Dust* album, then you don’t know its original arrangement and best performance.

From Southside Johnny’s 1991 *Better Days* LP, this is the definitive version of “All the Way Home.” The lyrics are a bit different, but it’s the melody and the band that transform this into powerful romantic ballad.

(Listen carefully–you’ll hear Bruce on backing vocals and keyboard.)
