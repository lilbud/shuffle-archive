<p>If you only know “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/09/08/roll-of-the-dice-all-the-way-home/">All the Way Home</a>” from the <em>Devils &amp; Dust</em> album, then you don’t know its original arrangement and best performance.</p>
<p>From Southside Johnny’s 1991 <em>Better Days</em> LP, this is the definitive version of “All the Way Home.” The lyrics are a bit different, but it’s the melody and the band that transform this into powerful romantic ballad.</p>
<p>(Listen carefully–you’ll hear Bruce on backing vocals and keyboard.)</p>
