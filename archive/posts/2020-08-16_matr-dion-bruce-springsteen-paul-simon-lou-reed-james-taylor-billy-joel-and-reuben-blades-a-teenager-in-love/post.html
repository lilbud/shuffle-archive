<p>On the evening of December 13, 1987, Paul Simon organized a benefit concert at Madison Square Garden in order to raise awareness and money to fight homelessness among New York City’s children.</p>
<p>The announced line-up was stellar on its own: Simon, of course, along with his Graceland tour mates Ladysmith Black Mambazo; James Taylor, Chaka Khan, Reuben Blades, Dion DiMucci, and Lou Reed were on the bill, too.</p>
<p>But it was the unadvertised guests during Dion’s set that sent the crowd through the roof: along with Paul Simon, Lou Reed, James Taylor, and Reuben Blades, Dion surprised the crowd by inviting Billy Joel and Bruce Springsteen to be his honorary Belmonts for the evening.</p>
<p>Together, the all-star ensemble performed Dion’s 1959 classic, “A Teenager in Love.” (Watch to the end to see Bruce get in one last doo-wop hook.)</p>

<p>“A Teenager in Love” peaked at #5 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1959. It was one of Dion’s greatest hits and is almost universally known and loved to this day.</p>
