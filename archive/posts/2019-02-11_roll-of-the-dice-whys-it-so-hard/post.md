***Updated 7/9/2020–**upon review, corrected to reflect Steve on vocals rather than Southside. (Thanks for the catch, Mike Saunders!)*

I almost feel guilty including “Why’s It So Hard” in the *Roll of the Dice* series.

Yes, it’s a Springsteen original–he wrote it in his Bruce Springsteen Band period, most likely in 1971.

And yes, we have a recording of it–a live performance by the Sundance Blues Band from January 21, 1972.

But although Bruce is present on the track, it’s actually Steve Van Zandt providing the lead vocals. And musically, the spotlight is clearly on Dave Sancious, who absolutely owns the performance both in terms of his presence in the sound mix and the ferocity of his performance.

Take a listen, and you’ll see what I mean:

But if “Why’s It So Hard” is musically mesmerizing, lyrically it’s rather forgettable.

This is a mutual breakup song, plain and simple, with spare lyrics that leave very little to analyze: a singer from out of town shacked up with his new girlfriend, and it didn’t work out so well. Bruce paints a clever metaphor, comparing the post-breakup town to a discarded, dried-out Christmas tree, but that’s about the extent of the songwriting craft on display.

*Take your last look, I’ll take mine*  
*Maybe I’ll see you around*  
*I know we both wonder what each other’s all about*  
*But ain’t it a shame that we’ll never find out*  
*Life goes on and everything remains the same*  
*in a little while babe, you look away from me*  
*but it don’t matter*  
*Just before I go babe, one thing I got to know:*

*Tell me mama, why is it so hard*  
*Tell me mama, why is it so hard*

*This here town of yours has brought me nothing but pain*  
*I thought love was sunshine, but it’s a midnight rain*

*Why can’t anybody stand the change? Oh, show me the reason*  
*Whole town looks like a Christmas tree baby, out of season*

*Well, I guess you got what you need, baby*  
*I can’t give you no more of mine*  
*I’m havin’ trouble movin’ on*  
*Oh I don’t wanna go…*

If “Why’s It So Hard” is notable for any other reason, it’s because it’s another early example of Bruce grappling with the right balance for a break-up song. (See “[She’s Leaving](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/02/03/roll-of-the-dice-shes-leaving/)” for a contemporaneous example with less anger and more self-pity.) I’d argue that Bruce would finally land on the right recipe a year later, but that’s an essay for another day.
