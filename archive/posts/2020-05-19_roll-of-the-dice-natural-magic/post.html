<p>Ah, the summer of 1971: a golden era for fans of the soul side of Bruce Springsteen.</p>
<p>I’m far too young to have caught The Bruce Springsteen Band live in concert (I was only three years old when they disbanded), but I seem to turn to those bootlegs whenever summer nears. Something about those warm, bluesy rock and soul arrangements feels appropriate for a lazy, sunny afternoon.</p>
<p>Today, we’ll take a listen to one of my favorite original songs from this period: “Natural Magic,” performed on at least three occasions but captured on tape only once–on July 29, 1971 at D’Scene in South Amboy, New Jersey.</p>

<p>“Natural Magic” may be an original Springsteen song, but it clearly owes a debt of influence to Van Morrison. We can clearly hear the similarities with “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/06/27/cover-me-crazy-love/">Crazy Love</a>,” released the year prior.</p>

<p>“Natural Magic” doesn’t tread any new lyrical ground either–mountain high/water wide pairings weren’t exactly original ideas by that time.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>I’d climb a mountain if you want me to</em><br/>
<em>I’d swim the ocean just to get to you</em><br/>
<em>I’d do most anything that you ask me to do</em><br/>
<em>Don’t you know now darling, my loving’s for you</em><br/>
<em>Oh but don’t take me for a fool</em><br/>
<em>‘Cause it’d be the wrong thing to do</em><br/>
<em>In the end it sure would be tragic</em><br/>
<em>Because my baby’s natural magic</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>I’d steal the moon from the midnight sky</em><br/>
<em>Sprinkle him with stardust and tie him in butterflies</em><br/>
<em>I’d buy for you a sailing ship and I’d set out on the sea</em><br/>
<em>All I ask of you, darling: you let me be free</em><br/>
<em>And if that is too much to do</em><br/>
<em>To keep my girl from singing the blues</em><br/>
<em>In the end it sure would be tragic</em><br/>
<em>Because my baby’s natural magic</em></p>
<p>And yet, despite wearing its influences on its sleeve, “Natural Magic” is sweet and charmingly earnest. Together with songs like “<a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/01/13/roll-of-the-dice-you-mean-so-much-to-me/">You Mean So Much to Me</a>” (played just two songs prior that night) and “<a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/02/03/roll-of-the-dice-shes-leaving/">She’s Leaving</a>,” “Natural Magic” represents the beginning of a soulfully romantic vein that Bruce would mine for many years to come.</p>
