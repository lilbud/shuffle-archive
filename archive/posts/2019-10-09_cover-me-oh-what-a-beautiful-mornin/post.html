<p>Okay, we all know that Bruce Springsteen is a John Steinbeck fan.</p>
<p>But did you know that Steinbeck’s wife was a Bruce Springsteen fan?</p>
<p>It’s true: the late Elaine Steinbeck was a self-professed tramp like us long before Bruce paid tribute to her husband with his <em><a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2023/06/03/album-companion-the-ghost-of-tom-joad/">The Ghost of Tom Joad</a> </em>album.  She was thrilled when Bruce appropriated Tom Joad for his album, and at the age of 81, she took her grandson backstage at one of Bruce’s concerts.</p>
<p>Presumably, Elaine charmed Bruce enough that a few years later, he joined a cast of notables including Gary Sinise, E. L. Doctorow, and Roddy McDowall to pay tribute to her on the occasion of the Bay Street Theater in Sag Harbor naming its stage after her. (Elaine was an accomplished theater stage manager.)</p>
<p>Bruce’s first choice of song that evening was a classic drawn directly from the theater: “Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin'” from the Broadway musical <em>Oklahoma!</em></p>

<p>I almost feel silly sharing the original 1943 cast album recording for comparison, because <em>of course</em> you know it. We all do–it’s one of the most well-known songs from one of the most well-known musicals.</p>

<p>In 1998, Bruce was still very much performing in his Tom Joad style, and it’s a little bit jarring to hear him sing such a sunny song in a style that would have been right at home on his 1995-1997 acoustic tour.</p>
<p>Bruce pulls it off with sincerity and aplomb; nevertheless, it’s likely to remain a genuine one-off.</p>
