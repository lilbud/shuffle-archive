Vinnie Roslin keeps that funky bass riff going for the full ten minutes, Vini Lopez plays with remarkable restraint, and Bruce&#8230; well, let&#8217;s just say he earns his &#8220;fastest-guitar-in-the-east&#8221; reputation on this one.</p>\n<p>Take a listen:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Steel Mill-Jeannie i want to thank you.1969 live wmv\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OlKWGXn06pU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>The band turns in such a confident, powerful performance that we almost don&#8217;t notice that Bruce only wrote twelve lines for the entire ten-minute song.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s okay, because like much of Bruce&#8217;s material from that period, the lyrics are more in service of the music rather than any particular message. &#8220;Jeannie, I Want to Thank You&#8221; places us in the aftermath of a break-up, and Bruce is definitely the dumped one.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Jeannie I want to thank you</em><br />\n<em>For the ride &#8217;cause it was fun</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;d like to go around another turn</em><br />\n<em>But that ride is done</em><br />\n<em>The game it has been won by you</em><br />\n<em>Whoa darling, darling, darling don&#8217;t go</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Sometimes I think I was such a fool</em><br />\n<em>For doing the things I done</em><br />\n<em>But the consequences are dearly felt</em><br />\n<em>As I stand alone</em><br />\n<em>A man without a home or you</em><br />\n<em>And darling, darling, darling come home</em></p>\n<p>We&#8217;re hard-pressed to determine how seriously Bruce took this relationship. Clearly he didn&#8217;t want it to end, and obviously he wants her back&#8211;but he also strikes a cavalier tone with both the lyrics and music, characterizing their relationship as a fun ride, and admitting regret for his actions only sometimes.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s probably best not to dwell on the song&#8217;s depth, however, any more than Bruce himself does. This song is all about the instrumental break, one that&#8217;s far longer than the song itself.</p>\n<p>But oh, that break&#8211;it&#8217;s one of my favorite Springsteen moments from the Steel Mill era.</p>\n<p><strong>Jeannie, I Want to Thank You<br />\nNever recorded</strong><br />\n<strong>Never released</strong><br />\n<strong>First performed:</strong> January 13, 1970 (San Francisco, CA)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> June 13, 1970 (Bricktown, NJ)</p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
