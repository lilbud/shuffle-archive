Each of today&#8217;s artists gifts us with a different spin on Bruce&#8217;s oft-covered classic.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s start off with singer-songwriter Stefanie Joyce&#8217;s country arrangement. &#8220;This song is so fun because it&#8217;s been covered by so many artists in so many drastically different ways,&#8221; Stefanie wrote on her YouTube page. &#8220;I&#8217;m partial to the Whitey Morgan version. We tried to do something a bit country, a bit bluegrass, and a whole lotta dark.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Stefanie enlisted Danya Olsen on fiddle and Nick Halsted on percussion and backing vocals for an intimate trio arrangement that serves the song admirably. If you&#8217;re interested in hearing Stefanie&#8217;s own music, check out her site <a href=\"https://stefaniejoycemusic.com/#:~:text=Steeped%20in%20the%20tradition%20of,redemption%2C%20and%20everything%20in%20between.\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Now let&#8217;s take a trip in time. Our next cover artists reimagine &#8220;I&#8217;m on Fire&#8221; in styles that were popular long before or well after Bruce&#8217;s 1985 single was climbing the charts.</p>\n<p>First up is <a href=\"https://vanilaswing.com/\">Vanila Swing, </a>a rockabilly/swing band from Athens, Greece. After a moody first verse, the band cuts loose with a 1950s-style rockabilly arrangement that&#8217;ll get you on the dance floor. It might lose the tension in Bruce&#8217;s original version but it certainly retains the heat.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"I&#039;m on fire- Vanila swing cover\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iRFG-K4ahLA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Moving forward a few decades, Philly-based Sharon Little and Tim Sonnefeld show us what Bruce&#8217;s song might have sounded like if he&#8217;d released it in the mid-nineties instead of the mid-eighties. Sonnefeld&#8217;s backing track is moody, broody, and intense&#8211;and Little&#8217;s vocals will blow you away, particularly when the song bursts open about halfway through.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"I&#039;m On Fire - Bruce Springsteen [Sharon Little Cover]\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/t3aoZZpAoAw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>If Sharon&#8217;s name and voice sound familiar, you might have seen her at Light of Day in 2017 or opening for Robert Plant, Alison Krauss and T Bone Burnett before that. Her songs have also been featured in several television show episodes, and you can check out all her original music <a href=\"https://sharonlittle.com/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>And as long as we&#8217;re in a moody mood, let&#8217;s check out French musician Halem&#8217;s stunning bluesy cover of &#8220;I&#8217;m on Fire&#8221; from his upcoming EP. This one is best listened to with the lights out!</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"I&#039;m On Fire - Halem (Bruce Springsteen Cover)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hPNnB7wVtkI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer;

is their most recent release, and while it may be the most familiar-sounding of today&#8217;s round-up, it&#8217;s a truly great performance that really captures the song&#8217;s steamy soul.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"I&#039;m On Fire - Bruce Springsteen (cover by The Evergreens)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7ZxORhHKrVM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer;
