Unlike Bruce, who sojourned for a while in Southern California, Joe remains steadfastly rooted to the Iron City.</p>\n<p>Might he have made it big(ger) if he&#8217;d moved somewhere with a more vibrant music industry? Who knows. But in the title track of his 2009 album <em>East Carson Street,\u00a0</em>Joe adamantly rejects the notion that one has to leave home to find satisfaction.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"758\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ijk8P5M8foo?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></div>\n<p>&#8220;East Carson Street&#8221; feels too personal to not be at least somewhat autobiographical, but Joe is too skilled a songwriter to narrow his song&#8217;s resonance. &#8220;East Carson Street&#8221; feels universal, a song for anyone lucky enough to already have a sense of community and belonging that no amount of fame and fortune could ever buy.</p>\n<p>Oh, and the Springsteen connection? Bruce plays guitar on the track. Don&#8217;t let that distract you, though&#8211;&#8220;East Carson Street&#8221; is one of Joe&#8217;s best 21st century songs no matter who&#8217;s playing on it.</p>\n<p><strong>East Carson
