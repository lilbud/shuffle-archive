<p>It feels weird to describe a murder ballad as beautiful, but I can’t help it: Carson and Skylar McKee’s sibling harmonies and acoustic/electric arrangement transform Bruce’s haunting 1982 <a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/04/16/roll-of-the-dice-nebraska/">title track</a> into something absolutely lovely.</p>

<p>Carson’s acoustic-electric guitar underpins their performance with a sinister bass line that never lets us forget that we’re listening to a serial killer’s tale. But dang, those harmonies and that delicate guitar interplay… I just want to listen to this over and over.</p>
<p>This isn’t Carson’s first foray into the Springsteen catalog, however. He released a cover of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/09/11/roll-of-the-dice-im-on-fire/">I’m on Fire</a>” a full year ago with his Other Favorites bandmate Josh Turner, and it’s equally wonderful. And because I have way too many “I’m on Fire” covers left to blog about, I’m serving up a rare double-shot today.</p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>
