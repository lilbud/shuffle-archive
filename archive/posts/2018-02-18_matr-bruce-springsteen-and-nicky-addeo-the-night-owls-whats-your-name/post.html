<p>On April 2, 2011, Nicky Addeo and the Night Owls played the Wonder Bar in Asbury Park.</p>
<p>Nicky Addeo isn’t a household name, but in 1963 he released a song called “Gloria” with The Darchaes, and Bruce was a big fan of it.</p>
<p>“When you wanted to make your move, you waited for Nicky Addeo to sing <a href="https://youtu.be/7TSwtof6LTQ">Gloria</a>,” Bruce explained that evening in Asbury Park. Bruce got a chance to play the song with Nicky that night, and he stayed on stage for several songs, including “What’s Your Name?”</p>

<p>“What’s Your Name” was released in 1962 by Don and Juan. It was their only hit, reaching #7 on the Billboard pop chart. The boys’ cover is pretty true to the original.</p>
