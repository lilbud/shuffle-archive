Released on their <em>Vitalogy\u00a0</em>album in 1994, the song was a smash hit for Pearl Jam despite never being issued as a single.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Pearl Jam - Better Man (Official Audio)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nDK-wsdEhNE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>It topped the Billboard Album Rock Tracks chart for eight weeks and stopped one spot shy of the top of the Modern Rock Track chart. It reached #13 in the Top 40 Mainstream chart and went on to amass accolade after accolade over the years.</p>\n<p>So when Eddie Vedder joined Bruce on stage in 2004 to perform it, &#8220;Better Man&#8221; already had a decade of fan-favorite status under its belt.</p>\n<p>However, it&#8217;s actually a much older song than most of Bruce&#8217;s fans likely realize. Written about his mother&#8217;s relationship with his stepfather while Vedder was in high school, &#8220;Better Man&#8221; dates back to 1980(ish). It&#8217;s a searing indictment of an abusive relationship and a scream of frustration over the fear of leaving it. (Vedder often dedicated the song to &#8220;the bastard that married my momma&#8221; after the couple finally divorced.)</p>\n<p>Eddie first recorded &#8220;Better Man&#8221; in 1988 with his pre-PJ band, Bad Radio.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bad Radio - Better Man (1st Studio Version - Demos 1988)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KQkhP4isUp4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>He performed it live with Bad Radio, too, so by the time he recorded it with Pearl Jam years later, &#8220;Better Man&#8221; was both time- and road-tested.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bad Radio - Better Man - San Diego (June 10, 1989) (Soundboard Audio)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aeD1fywAK5w?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>When Bruce and Eddie performed it together in 2004, &#8220;Better Man&#8221; was a quarter-century old. The setting was the final show of the Vote for Change Show, just weeks before the 2004 U.S. presidential election.</p>\n<p>At first blush, it might have seemed like pure fan service: two of rock&#8217;s greatest frontmen teaming up on one of Vedder&#8217;s signature songs. But a careful listen to the lyrics of &#8220;Better Man&#8221; reveals a deep (if unintentional) resonance to the evening&#8217;s theme. Embroiled in a costly, deadly war they didn&#8217;t want and suffering the erosion of their civil liberties, Americans had largely soured on the leadership of President Bush (his approval rating was 46% just prior to the election).</p>\n<p>And yet, for many, the fear of changing leaders at such a volatile time was reason enough to stay the course. <em>What if we can&#8217;t find a better man?</em> Senator John Kerry positioned himself as one, but voters ultimately decided not to take the chance.</p>\n<p>As a political cause, Vote For Change was a failed endeavor, but it produced some memorable moments along the way. Bruce and Eddie&#8217;s &#8220;Better Man&#8221; performance was chief among them.</p>\n<div id=\"v-IvxI47QM-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='536' src='https://videopress.com/embed/IvxI47QM?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>Who would have thought the E Street Band was so perfectly suited for a song so strongly identified with the harder, edgier Pearl Jam? Yet they were, right down to Clarence&#8217;s smoking sax solo, one of his best post-Reunion on-stage moments. Bruce brought his A game, too, especially on a guitar solo of epic length and power we rarely saw from Bruce at that point of his career.</p>\n<p>Bruce and Eddie would go on to perform together several more times over the years, but never again would they play one of Vedder&#8217;s own songs. Their one-time-only &#8220;Better Man&#8221; team-up remains one of the most exciting on-stage team-ups of Bruce&#8217;s career.</p>\n<p><strong>Better Man<br />\nFirst performed:</strong> October 13, 2004 (East Rutherford, NJ)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> October 13, 2004 (East Rutherford, NJ)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>One time only: Bruce and Eddie Vedder team up on one of Eddie&#8217;s oldest and most beloved songs.</p>\n", "protected": false}, "author": 1, "featured_media": 39222, "comment_status": "open", "ping_status": "open", "sticky": false, "template": "", "format": "standard", "meta": {"_monsterinsights_skip_tracking": false, "_monsterinsights_sitenote_active": false, "_monsterinsights_sitenote_note": "", "_monsterinsights_sitenote_category": 0, "jetpack_post_was_ever_published": false, "_jetpack_newsletter_access": "", "_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs": false, "_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id": 0, "_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content": false, "_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content": false, "footnotes": "", "jetpack_publicize_message": "", "jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled": true, "jetpack_social_post_already_shared": true, "jetpack_social_options": {"image_generator_settings": {"template": "highway", "default_image_id": 0, "font": "", "enabled": false}, "version": 2}}, "categories": [4, 5], "tags": [3548, 104, 1437, 1789], "class_list": ["post-39221", "post", "type-post", "status-publish", "format-standard", "has-post-thumbnail", "hentry", "category-cover-me", "category-meeting-across-the-river", "tag-betterman", "tag-eddie-vedder", "tag-pearl-jam", "tag-vote-for-change"], "aioseo_notices": [], "jetpack_publicize_connections": [], "jetpack_featured_media_url": "https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/betterman.webp?fit=3000%2C2383&ssl=1", "jetpack_sharing_enabled": true, "jetpack_shortlink": "https://wp.me/p9w3Lk-acB", "jetpack_likes_enabled": true, "jetpack-related-posts": [{"id": 242, "url": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/01/16/cover-me-eddie-vedder-one-step-up/", "url_meta": {"origin": 39221, "position": 0}, "title": "Cover Me, Eddie Vedder: One Step Up", "author": "Ken", "date": "January 16, 2018", "format": false, "excerpt": "A pre-Pearl Jam Eddie Vedder covers one of Bruce's loveliest songs.", "rel": "", "context": "In &quot;Cover Me&quot;", "block_context": {"text": "Cover Me", "link": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/category/cover-me/"}, "img": {"alt_text": "", "src": "https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/bad-radio.jpg?fit=480%2C360&ssl=1&resize=350%2C200", "width": 350, "height": 200}, "classes": []}, {"id": 29664, "url": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/09/19/cover-me-eddie-vedder-my-city-of-ruins/", "url_meta": {"origin": 39221, "position": 1}, "title": "Cover Me, Eddie Vedder: My City of Ruins", "author": "Ken", "date": "September 19, 2021", "format": false, "excerpt": "Eddie Vedder covered \"My City of Ruins\" last night in the town it was written for.
