Bruce and the band were still finishing up their soundcheck, and noticing the &#8220;paying customers,&#8221; Bruce decided to give them a special treat before heading backstage until showtime.</p>\n<p>Bruce&#8217;s selection was an obscure one: the sweet, romantic &#8220;For Your Love.&#8221; Not the Yardbirds&#8217; song, mind you, but the 1957 Ed Townsend version by the same name.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Ed Townsend  &quot;For Your Love&quot;\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9y1gfYcpXA4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;For Your Love&#8221; was Townsend&#8217;s first and last great hit, peaking at #13 on the Billboard Hot 100. But if you&#8217;re only going to have one big song, this is a great one to stand on. Townsend&#8217;s warm vocals and lush arrangement are evergreen; that sax solo and those soaring backing vocals make me swoon every time.</p>\n<p>Although &#8220;For Your Love&#8221; certainly fit the theme of Bruce&#8217;s Tunnel of Love Tour, I&#8217;m guessing most of the fans in the room didn&#8217;t recognize it. Thirty years after it charted, &#8220;For Your Love&#8221; was an obscure choice, but Bruce&#8217;s soundchecks were full of wild cards at the time&#8211;in part due to the presence of the Miami Horns (renamed The Horns of Love for that tour), who seemed to be up for anything Bruce could throw at them.</p>\n<p>Bruce threw a curve ball with &#8220;For Your Love,&#8221; though. Rather than follow a more faithful reading, Bruce steered the band toward a decidedly reggae arrangement. (He&#8217;d been experimenting with reggae arrangements since transforming &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/04/09/roll-of-the-dice-my-hometown/\">My Hometown</a>,&#8221; &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/09/21/roll-of-the-dice-born-in-the-u-s-a/\">Born in the U.S.A.</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/07/24/cover-me-roll-of-the-dice-jersey-girl/\">Jersey Girl</a>&#8221; the summer before.</p>\n<p>The Horns followed Bruce&#8217;s lead, and you can hear for yourself how it turned out.</p>\n<p>https://youtu.be/QcJwrQnC1u0</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not bad. It&#8217;s even fun, and the audience certainly seemed appreciative.</p>\n<p>But (in my opinion, at least) the passion of Townsend&#8217;s original is lost in Bruce&#8217;s version, and that&#8217;s too bad&#8211;it might have made for a breathtaking cover in the right arrangement.</p>\n<p><strong>For Your Love<br />\nFirst performed (soundcheck only):</strong> May 23, 1988 (New York City, NY)<br
