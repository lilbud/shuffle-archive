<p>Here’s indie-EDM band Hot Chip’s take on Bruce’s greatest hit (with a little bit of LCD Soundsystem mashed in).</p>
<p>(Warning: Don’t be surprised if this sneaks up on you around two minute mark–and if you’re not dancing by the three minute mark, you’re probably not playing it loud enough.)</p>
