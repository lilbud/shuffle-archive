<p>Just in case Bruce’s original video for “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/12/25/roll-of-the-dice-dancing-in-the-dark/">Dancing in the Dark</a>” isn’t eighties enough for you… well, sometimes its better to just let a clip speak for itself.</p>
<p>Here’s indie-EDM band Hot Chip’s take on Bruce’s greatest hit (with a little bit of LCD Soundsystem mashed in).</p>
<p>(Warning: Don’t be surprised if this sneaks up on you around two minute mark–and if you’re not dancing by the three minute mark, you’re probably not playing it loud enough.)</p>
