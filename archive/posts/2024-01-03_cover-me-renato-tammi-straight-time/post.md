Anyway, the quality winner from last year was Renato Tammi, whose cover of “” is so eerily haunting that you’d think it hailed from instead of if you didn’t know better.

I would have featured Renato’s cover long ago if the list of “Dancing in the Dark” covers on my to-blog list weren’t so darn long.

Fortunately, Renato just released another Springsteen cover, and this one’s both obscure enough and superb enough to warrant an immediate spotlight.

It’s not surprising that Renato’s familiar with the outer reaches of Bruce’s catalog–he’s been a Springsteen fan since he was nine years old, he’s part of an Italian tribute combo called The Spring Street Band, and he’s had the opportunity to play with not one but two E Streeters: Jake Clemons and Vini Lopez.

Renato’s latest cover is a deep cut from : Bruce’s haunting morality struggle, “.” It’s not as contemplative as Bruce’s original, but it’s a bit more sinister–there isn’t much room for doubt about whether the narrator in Renato’s version is going to keep to the straight and narrow. (I’m not familiar with the song Renato segues into at the end, though… anyone want to clue me in?)
