<p>When L.A.-based Precious Metal covered Bruce Springsteen’s “<a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/05/28/roll-of-the-dice-two-hearts/">Two Hearts</a>” on their self-titled 1990 album, The Boss himself raved about it.</p>
<p>Or so we’re told at least, by the band themselves.</p>
<p>When journalists ask the band about that particular album, it’s usually the infamous Donald Trump incident that they want to know about. But when the all-woman pop/metal band was interviewed by <a href="http://www.metalmaidens.com/pmetal.htm">Metal Maidens</a>, they got a chance to retell their Springsteen story:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px"><b><em>Whose idea was it to record the Bruce Springsteen cover “Two Hearts” on this album?</em></b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px"><em>Leslie Knauer: “That guy, Bruce Springsteen’s producer… I can’t remember his name!”</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px">[Blogger’s note: I’m pretty sure she means Chuck Plotkin, who is credited as a co-producer on the <em>Precious Metal</em> album.]
</p><p style="padding-left: 40px"><em>Mara Fox: “Oh my gosh, neither can I! He wanted to produce our album and was a friend of the record company owner or something. Then he fell ill and wasn’t able to complete the album. He took Leslie to party with Bruce one night.”</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px"><em>Leslie: “Oh, yeah! I told Bruce, I was surprised how short he was!”</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px"><em>Mara: “ha ha! I remember that!”</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px"><em>Leslie: He told me he loved our version. Bruce halted the release of a <a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/11/26/cover-me-bette-midler-pink-cadillac/">Bette Midler version</a> of “<a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/08/21/roll-of-the-dice-pink-cadillac/">Pink Cadillac</a>“, ’cause he hated it. Thank goodness he didn’t do that to us!”</em></p>
<p>Take a listen to their Springsteen-endorsed cover below–it’s a hard-driving, glammed up, power pop rendition of Bruce’s 1980 classic.</p>
