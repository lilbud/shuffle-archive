When L.A.-based Precious Metal covered Bruce Springsteen's "[Two Hearts](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/05/28/roll-of-the-dice-two-hearts/)" on their self-titled 1990 album, The Boss himself raved about it.

Or so we're told at least, by the band themselves.

When journalists ask the band about that particular album, it's usually the infamous Donald Trump incident that they want to know about. But when the all-woman pop/metal band was interviewed by [Metal Maidens](https://www.metalmaidens.com/pmetal.htm), they got a chance to retell their Springsteen story:

***Whose idea was it to record the Bruce Springsteen cover "Two Hearts" on this album?***

*Leslie Knauer: "That guy, Bruce Springsteen's producer... I can't remember his name!"*

[Blogger's note: I'm pretty sure she means Chuck Plotkin, who is credited as a co-producer on the *Precious Metal* album.]

*Mara Fox: "Oh my gosh, neither can I! He wanted to produce our album and was a friend of the record company owner or something. Then he fell ill and wasn't able to complete the album. He took Leslie to party with Bruce one night."*

*Leslie: "Oh, yeah! I told Bruce, I was surprised how short he was!"*

*Mara: "ha ha! I remember that!"*

*Leslie: He told me he loved our version. Bruce halted the release of a [Bette Midler version](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/11/26/cover-me-bette-midler-pink-cadillac/) of "[Pink Cadillac](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/08/21/roll-of-the-dice-pink-cadillac/)", 'cause he hated it. Thank goodness he didn't do that to us!"*

Take a listen to their Springsteen-endorsed cover below–it's a hard-driving, glammed up, power pop rendition of Bruce's 1980 classic.
