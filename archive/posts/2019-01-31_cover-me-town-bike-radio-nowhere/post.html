<p>C’mon, admit it: who among us hasn’t wondered what it would sound like if The Ramones and The Go-Gos teamed up to cover “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/08/01/roll-of-the-dice-radio-nowhere/">Radio Nowhere</a>?”</p>
<p>Well, wonder no longer. because this delightful cover by Liverpool band Town Bike is pretty much exactly that. And I love it so much!</p>

<p>Kudos to Town Bike for realizing that “Radio Nowhere” was always a punk rocker at heart.</p>
