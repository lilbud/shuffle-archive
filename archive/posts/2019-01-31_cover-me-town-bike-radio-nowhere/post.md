C’mon, admit it: who among us hasn’t wondered what it would sound like if The Ramones and The Go-Gos teamed up to cover “[Radio Nowhere](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/08/01/roll-of-the-dice-radio-nowhere/)?”

Well, wonder no longer. because this delightful cover by Liverpool band Town Bike is pretty much exactly that. And I love it so much!

Kudos to Town Bike for realizing that “Radio Nowhere” was always a punk rocker at heart.
