Bruce wrote and performed it during his Steel Mill era, a period in which his songs were typically light on lyrical substance and heavy on instrumental jams.</p>\n<p>Even by Steel Mill standards, though, &#8220;Oh Mama&#8221; was a bit of a mess.</p>\n<audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-38923-9\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/1971-01-23-T02-Oh-Mama-Why_.mp3?_=9\" /><a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/1971-01-23-T02-Oh-Mama-Why_.mp3\">https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/1971-01-23-T02-Oh-Mama-Why_.mp3</a></audio>\n<p>Lyrically, it sounds like something written by a\u00a0 kid in a high school band&#8211;and that&#8217;s not a slam since Bruce was probably only twenty when he wrote it. Musically, I find &#8220;Oh Mama&#8221; a tough listen. There are certainly songs that showcase the boys&#8217; instrumental chops and vocal skills, but this isn&#8217;t one of them.</p>\n<p>Bruce turns in a couple of fine guitar solos, Danny dominates in the mix on the organ, and Vini does his best to hold everyone together. But those vocals&#8230; ouch. Perhaps they couldn&#8217;t hear themselves in the mix (there&#8217;s some late banter suggesting as much); let&#8217;s extend the benefit of the doubt.</p>\n<p>And yet, &#8220;Oh Mama&#8221; is still historically significant, and if you paid close attention to the opening verse, you already know why:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>You get up every morning at the sound of the bell</em><br />\n<em>You stumble out the door just a-feeling like hell</em><br />\n<em>I make it into class about a quarter past eight</em><br />\n<em>I hear my teacher yakking at me &#8217;cause I&#8217;m ten minutes late</em><br />\n<em>So down at my desk next to my girlfriend Mary</em><br />\n<em>You were late for a date so I went out with Harry</em><br />\n<em>Honey don&#8217;t you know I had to stay in the class</em><br />\n<em>I never took my homework on that old dark road</em><br />\n<em>This car, it ran out of gas</em></p>\n<p>That opening couplet grabbed your attention, didn&#8217;t it? Yep, &#8220;Oh Mama&#8221; is basically an early version of &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/10/31/roll-of-the-dice-night/\">Night</a>&#8221; (there&#8217;s even a &#8220;boss man&#8221; reference later in the song), written by a kid whose frame of reference was still closer to that of a student than a blue-collar laborer.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Oh Mama&#8221; isn&#8217;t anywhere near as romantic as &#8220;Night,&#8221; though. It&#8217;s pretty much the polar opposite in fact: Bruce spends the whole song complaining about his daily drudge while his girl busts his chops.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I get up every morning at the sound of the bell</em><br />\n<em>Oh mama, oh mama, why</em><br />\n<em>Stumble out the door just a-feeling like hell</em><br />\n<em>Oh mama, oh mama, why</em><br />\n<em>I get into class about a quarter past eight</em><br />\n<em>Oh mama, oh mama, why</em><br />\n<em>I get my teacher yakking at me cause I&#8217;m ten minutes late</em><br />\n<em>Oh mama, oh mama, why</em><br />\n<em>Oh mama, oh mama, why</em><br />\n<em>Why do you treat me like this?</em><br />\n<em>Oh mama, oh mama, why</em><br />\n<em>Cause when I look in your eyes you know I just can&#8217;t resist</em><br />\n<em>You&#8217;re my hully gully, baby, I&#8217;m all a-twist</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Oh mama, mama, mama, mama</em><br />\n<em>Gave up on the school and I gotta get a job</em><br />\n<em>Oh mama, oh mama, why</em><br />\n<em>My teacher and papa screaming that I look like a slob</em><br />\n<em>Oh mama, oh mama, why</em><br />\n<em>My boss man won&#8217;t give me a moment of peace</em><br />\n<em>Oh mama, oh mama, why</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;m low class, pumpin&#8217; gas, monkey in grease</em><br />\n<em>Oh mama, oh mama, why</em><br />\n<em>Oh mama, oh mama, why</em><br />\n<em>Why do you treat me like this, I don&#8217;t know</em><br />\n<em>Cause when I look in your eyes you know I just can&#8217;t resist</em><br />\n<em>You&#8217;re my hully gully, baby, I&#8217;m all a-twist</em></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not a memorable entry in the Springsteen songbook, and yet it was clearly significant enough that its author still remembered it four years later when writing material for his breakthrough album.</p>\n<p>He saved the first couplet, aged the narrator a few years, changed the focus from the day&#8217;s toil to the night&#8217;s release, wrapped it all in a bright, brash arrangement bursting with romantic zeal&#8230; and ended up with a classic that remains a fan favorite to this day.</p>\n<p>No one&#8217;s going to put &#8220;Oh Mama&#8221; on heavy rotation, but it&#8217;s a peak into the origins of a much stronger song and a great example of Bruce&#8217;s songwriting instincts. A great line waits for its time.</p>\n<p><strong>Oh Mama<br />\nFirst performed:</strong> November 27, 1970 (Asbury Park, NJ)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> January 23, 1971 (Asbury Park, NJ)</p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
