I really tried to put some more space between “” covers, but then this one popped up on YouTube a week ago and suddenly I’m off the wagon.

And yes, I know that Mumford & Sons have been covering “I’m on Fire” for years, and yes I know that many of those performances were captured on video in pretty great quality.

But in my opinion, this one stands head and shoulders above the others:

The band absolutely the pacing and the temperature, keeping the song at a slowly building simmer until it explodes before closing on a quietly sinister note.

Honestly, I’m not a huge Mumford & Sons fan, but this particular performance of “I’m on Fire” has immediately become one of my favorites among a sea of covers of this particular song.
