<p>We lost a great one this week.</p>
<p>Bill Withers passed away on March 30, leaving us with a string of timeless hits that will remain firmly embedded in our personal and cultural soundtracks for decades to come.</p>
<p>None more so than “Lean on Me.” Withers’ evergreen ode to friendship resonates with each and every one of us. You know it from its opening notes, and you can sing it from memory.</p>

<p>At one point or another, you’ve sung “Lean on Me” with, to, or about a good friend. We all have.</p>
<p>It’s one of those rare songs that gets us through tough times and help us get others through them, too.</p>
<p>It was a hit when it was originally released, topping both the Billboard Hot 100 and Soul Singles charts; it’s stood the test of time, ranking #208 on <em>Rolling Stone’s</em> 500 Greatest Songs of All Time; and it will live forever as a favorite on karaoke night.</p>
<p>There have been several covers of “Lean on Me” over the years, and there will doubtlessly be countless more.</p>
<p>But the rule is: You gotta cover it with a friend. “Lean on Me” works much better as a duet than it does solo. And on the evening of June 9, 1989 at Nils Lofgren’s show at The Stone Pony in Asbury Park, Nils and Bruce Springsteen demonstrated that.</p>
<p>It was the only time Bruce has ever performed “Lean on Me” in public, and thankfully a fan was able to film and share it in terrific quality.</p>
<p>So let’s take a moment to watch, remember, and celebrate the life and work of Bill Withers. And then let’s call our best friends.</p>
