<p>Bruce recorded a solo acoustic version for <em>Greetings for Asbury Park, N.J.</em> (although it was obviously cut from the final album)…</p>

<p>…and he worked up a powerful, psychedelic full-band arrangement of it for The Bruce Springsteen Band in early 1972.</p>

<p>Obviously, “Cowboys of the Sea” is an <em>Important Song, </em>so when the dice turned this one up, I made sure to give each and every version a deep listen.</p>

<p>I gave Bruce’s lyrics extra-close inspection, and I mused and reflected on what themes, symbolism, and metaphor might be at work.</p>
<p>And after much consideration, I arrived at the conclusion that “Cowboys of the Sea” is about… undersea cowboys.</p>
<p>Seriously.</p>
<p>I mean, come on: we’re talking about a 21-year-old songwriter who grew up fascinated with westerns and now lived in a beach town. Undersea cowboys is <em>high concept</em>, folks!</p>
<p>Yes, there’s a concluding verse that touches on environmental and possibly class-conflict themes, but it arrives too late for me to consider it anything but an afterthought. This song is all about the undersea cowboys.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Well, they ride beneath the waves at twenty-thousand leagues</em><br/>
<em>On stallions stitched to seaweed strands, so smiling, so smiling</em><br/>
<em>They herd the fishes of the deep, they ride for you and me</em><br/>
<em>They ranch the rich and the sunken soil at the bottom of the sea</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>And in the dead of night, alive in sleep I hear them calling me</em><br/>
<em>Them deep sea desperadoes, them midnight maelstrom freaks, the cowboys of the sea</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>So on wings of sleep I pierce the deep and ride like a hurricane</em><br/>
<em>In midnight still I paid my bill, I turned my back on the land</em><br/>
<em>With the help of Old Paint, that seaweed nag, it’s just Jesse James and me</em><br/>
<em>We ride the depths and we rob the banks with the cowboys of the sea</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>With a seaman’s grip on navigation and some fired, hired hands</em><br/>
<em>Whoa, we set forth to confront the nation and lend a cowboy’s hand</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>We do the dolphin’s dance duet, my mermaid babe and me</em><br/>
<em>Then I ride off into the blue sunset at the bottom of the sea</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Whoa, and with the seaman’s grip on submarining and some aqualung outlaws</em><br/>
<em>Our guns are made of solid dreaming and bullets of the cause</em><br/>
<em>Whoa, and with hand held high to touch the sky a good Texas Ranger I’ll be</em><br/>
<em>But sometimes I feel like a lone stranger ‘midst the cowboys of the sea</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Oh, and man above he just can’t make love, he’s gotta rape his mother the sea</em><br/>
<em>Because of his greed we’re a vanishing breed, we cowboys of the sea</em><br/>
<em>With the cowboys of the sea</em></p>
<p>It’s easy to understand why Bruce was so taken with his song; it’s equally easy to understand why those around him did their best to distract him from it. The concept is clever, but the lyrics are clunky. (There a few neat internal rhymes, a device to which Bruce was quickly warming, but nothing as noteworthy or as artful as those he’d write shortly after.)</p>
<p>The song is stronger musically, but if the acoustic arrangement sounds familiar, that’s because it’s a prototype for what would eventually make the album as “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/02/20/roll-of-the-dice-lost-in-the-flood/">Lost in the Flood</a>.”</p>
<p>The full-band version is more noteworthy. It’s one of those Steel Mill holdover arrangements that feels ill-suited for The Bruce Springsteen Band (Sancious gets a workout, but not a challenge), and the unrivaled highlight of the track is Bruce’s’ blisteringly, jaw-droppingly fast mid-song guitar solo. It’s an instructive example for those who wonder how Bruce had earned his reputation as the fastest guitar-slinger on the Jersey Shore.</p>
<p>In the end, “Cowboys of the Sea” is little more than a footnote in Bruce’s recording history, but it’s a clever asterisk for a young songwriter honing his craft with what would prove to be a couple of his favorite themes.</p>
