<p>As official state songs go, Oklahoma’s got it pretty good.</p>
<p>My home state of Pennsylvania has a rather unremarkable anthem.</p>

<p>New York’s official song is memorable… but perhaps just a bit dated.</p>

<p>New Jersey doesn’t even <em>have</em> a state song. (How is that still possible?)</p>
<p>But Oklahoma has a great one:</p>

<p>Woody Guthrie wrote “Oklahoma Hills,” but it was his cousin Jack who made it famous when the lesser-known Guthrie recorded a Western swing version and topped the charts with it for six weeks in 1945.</p>
<p>More than a half-century later, Woody’s son performed “Oklahoma Hills” at a tribute concert for Woody, sponsored by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.</p>
<p>Bruce Springsteen and Joe Ely joined Arlo for the performance, with each singer taking lead vocals for a verse–a one-time-only team-up that was thankfully captured on video.</p>

<p>Jimmy LaFave was also there that night, but he didn’t take part in that particular song. Bruce rectified that almost a decade later, when he invited LaFave to join him on stage during the encore set of his solo acoustic show in Grand Prairie, Texas.</p>

<p>Bruce and Jimmy’s performance of “Oklahoma Hills” was a brighter and stronger one than the Hall of Fame performance a decade earlier, with the two singers’ guitars and voices blending nicely.</p>
<p>Other than one other performance in 2006 (where Bruce was one of about 20 guitar players on stage), these are Bruce’s only two known performances of “Oklahoma Hills.”</p>
<p><strong>Oklahoma Hills<br/>
First performed:</strong> September 29, 1996 (Cleveland, OH)<br/>
