<p>You’re either going to love this or hate it.</p>
<p>Me, I’m fascinated by it.</p>
<p>I’m new to Shovels &amp; Rope. I discovered them by accident when they opened up for The Avett Brothers and The Head and The Heart at the Gorge Amphitheater a couple of months back, and I dug their stripped-down, country/folk sound.</p>
<p>Imagine my surprise when I searched for their music and found this little gem, released as a 7″ vinyl one-off in 2013.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxNAz7rVLzU">Watch on Youtube: Johnny 99</a></p>
<p>We know from the opening bars that this is going to be an unusual cover–it’s piano-heavy, and both the vocals and instrumentals by husband-and-wife Michael Trent and Carrie Ann Hearst sound like they had pre-funked with Tanqueray and wine.</p>
<p>I’ve never been comfortable with the rockabilly arrangement that Bruce has favored for “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/07/20/roll-of-the-dice-johnny-99/">Johnny 99</a>” in recent years. I think I know what he was reaching for, but in concert he tends to overshoot the antihero’s bravado and end up almost in celebration territory.</p>
<p>Shovels &amp; Rope get it. They understand that Jonny’s defiance is a false, manic front, and their take captures the sense of gradually unraveling desperation that Bruce’s concert arrangement misses.</p>
<p>And that last verse… <em>that’s</em> how I always imagined Johnny 99 in that courtroom in the end.</p>
<p>A powerful, well-done cover.</p>
