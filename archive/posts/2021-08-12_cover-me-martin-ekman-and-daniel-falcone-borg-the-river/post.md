Swedish singer-songwriter Marin Ekman and his lifelong friend, bandmate, and multi-instrumentalist Daniel Falcone Borg have been been singing and performing together since they were quite young.

Their ease and comfort with each other shines through in this gorgeous cover of “[The River](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/03/04/roll-of-the-dice-the-river/).”

Ekman’s spare, quiet arrangement is appropriately poignant with lovely harmonies, and both singers show an obvious reverence for the source material.

By the dramatic pause that precedes the final chorus, I found myself holding my breath, and I was rapt through the final wistful note.

Bra gjort, gentlemen!
