<p>Swedish singer-songwriter Marin Ekman and his lifelong friend, bandmate, and multi-instrumentalist Daniel Falcone Borg have been been singing and performing together since they were quite young.</p>
<p>Their ease and comfort with each other shines through in this gorgeous cover of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/03/04/roll-of-the-dice-the-river/">The River</a>.”</p>

<p>Ekman’s spare, quiet arrangement is appropriately poignant with lovely harmonies, and both singers show an obvious reverence for the source material.</p>
<p>By the dramatic pause that precedes the final chorus, I found myself holding my breath, and I was rapt through the final wistful note.</p>
<p>Bra gjort, gentlemen!</p>
