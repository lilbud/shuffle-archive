Clarence Clemons may have turned in some more technically impressive solos in his time, but in &#8220;Drive All Night,&#8221; Clarence carries the emotional heft of the song and delivers one of the most ardent, powerful, true-blue love notes ever recorded.</p>\n<p>Gets me every dang time.</p>\n<p>It sneaks up on you&#8211;the song begins with Garry Tallent&#8217;s slow, methodical bassline and a simple five-note piano motif (played by Bruce). For the first minute, there&#8217;s no hint of what&#8217;s to come, as Bruce sets the scene:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>When I lost you honey, sometimes I think I lost my guts too</em><br />\n<em>And I wish God would send me a word, send me something I&#8217;m afraid to lose</em></p>\n<p>Lyrically, we&#8217;re in &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/11/10/roll-of-the-dice-back-in-your-arms/\">Back in Your Arms</a>&#8221; territory (that later song is essentially &#8220;Drive All Night&#8221; as performed by the Righteous Brothers) &#8212; Bruce done screwed up, and he can&#8217;t fix it.</p>\n<p>Right at the one-minute mark, the song lifts off from the earth, as Bruce&#8217;s vocals become higher-pitched and more strident:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Lying in the heat of the night like prisoners all our lives</em><br />\n<em>And I get shivers down my spine, girl, and all I wanna do is hold you tight</em></p>\n<p>And then that wife-infuriating chorus:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>I swear I&#8217;ll drive all night again just to buy you some shoes\u00a0and to taste your tender charms</em><br />\n<em>And I just wanna sleep tonight again in your arms</em></p>\n<p>(See? &#8220;Drive All Night&#8221; = &#8220;Back in Your Arms&#8221;)</p>\n<p>And then at the two-minute mark, Roy Bittan sprinkles organ and harpsichord like snow and stardust across the scene.</p>\n<p>Bruce surveys the scene and knows his odds are slim:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Tonight there&#8217;s fallen angels and they&#8217;re waiting for us down in the street</em><br />\n<em>And tonight there&#8217;s calling strangers, hear them crying in defeat</em></p>\n<p>The lovers are obviously in the same house, if not the same room. But there&#8217;s a distance he can&#8217;t close, and he&#8217;s not about to give up without a fight. Or begging.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Let them go, let them go, let them go do their dances of the dead</em><br />\n<em>Let &#8217;em go right ahead, girl</em><br />\n<em>You just dry your eyes</em><br />\n<em>And come on, come on, come on, come on&#8230; let&#8217;s go to bed</em></p>\n<p>That&#8217;s a perfect verse right there&#8211;music and lyrics perfectly attuned to each other, at once defiant and desperate, bravado and vulnerability.</p>\n<p>And then the chorus again, as Max momentarily summons Bruce&#8217;s determination at the top.</p>\n<p>and then&#8230;</p>\n<p>and then&#8230;</p>\n<p>That sax.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s majestic and soaring, tireless and resolute, aching and soothing&#8211;it encapsulates the entire song in a brief solo.</p>\n<p>Even Bruce acknowledges that Clarence is carrying the weight, as he echoes &#8220;I know, I know, I know&#8221; underneath Clarence.</p>\n<p>Fueled with passion and determination, Bruce isn&#8217;t backing down&#8211;he&#8217;s a veritable US postal carrier:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>You&#8217;ve got, you&#8217;ve got, you&#8217;ve got my, my love, girl, you&#8217;ve got my love, girl</em><br />\n<em>Through the wind, through the rain, the snow, the wind, the rain</em><br />\n<em>You&#8217;ve got, you&#8217;ve got my, my love, oh girl you&#8217;ve got my love</em><br />\n<em>You&#8217;ve got, you&#8217;ve got my love, oh girl you&#8217;ve got my love</em><br />\n<em>You&#8217;ve got, you&#8217;ve got my love, oh girl you&#8217;ve got my love</em><br />\n<em>You&#8217;ve got, you&#8217;ve got my love, oh girl you&#8217;ve got my love</em></p>\n<p>And if Bruce can hold a candle to Clarence&#8217;s solo at any point in the song, it&#8217;s in the culminating &#8220;Heeeeeaaaaaaaarrrrt and Soooooooooooouuuuul&#8221; refrain that rivals the wordless howl in &#8220;Jungleland&#8221; in its loaded power.</p>\n<p>As the song takes its time winding to a conclusion, Bruce never wavers in his conviction:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Through the wind</em><br />\n<em>Through the rain</em><br />\n<em>Through the snow</em></p>\n<p>He&#8217;ll drive all night.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Drive All Night&#8221; is easily in my top ten all-time favorite Springsteen songs. That list changes frequently, but I don&#8217;t think DAN ever left it. In concert, it&#8217;s performed only rarely (outside of the River full-album shows) and it only grows in power over time.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, for long-time fans, &#8220;Drive All Night&#8221; began in concert: the first time Bruce sang the lyrics was in an introduction to &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/08/12/roll-of-the-dice-wrecking-ball/\">Backstreets</a>&#8221; on New Years&#8217; Eve in 1977. That show is available on YouTube, but it omits the one-time-only introduction. Check it out below to hear the first-ever proto-&#8220;Drive All Night.&#8221;</p>\n<audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-827-2\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/204-Drive-All-Night-online-audio-converter.com_.mp3?_=2\" /><a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/204-Drive-All-Night-online-audio-converter.com_.mp3\">http://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/204-Drive-All-Night-online-audio-converter.com_.mp3</a></audio>\n<p>But many fans were first exposed to the lyrics in a mid-song performance art piece that characterized &#8220;Backstreets&#8221; from 1977 through 1978. The interlude came to be known as &#8220;Sad Eyes&#8221; and typically conveyed a tale of anger and betrayal, but at times during the Darkness tour, some familiar lines shone through:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"22.

Maybe he was, but not for &#8220;Drive All Night.&#8221; That song had already been recorded, but not released&#8211;so Bruce incorporated the powerful lines into his mid-set performance piece. (I&#8217;ve read accounts that maintain that Bruce wrote the song as a by-product of the &#8220;Sad Eyes&#8221; interlude, but studio session notes clearly show that isn&#8217;t the case.)</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s an early cut of the song, recorded in August 1977. It lacks the bassline and sax solo, and Bruce&#8217;s piano is more tentative than in the final version; as a result, it lacks the power and heft of the finished version.</p>\n<p>(The lyrics are also rough&#8211; &#8220;your jewelers&#8217; eye&#8221; is a bit clunky and would be dropped before the final recording.)</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen Drive All Night #2 alternate Version\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HERGdJyu35s?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Here&#8217;s an almost final version&#8211;&#8220;jeweler&#8217;s eye&#8221; is still in there, but otherwise, it&#8217;s very close to the final cut. In fact, the instrumental track is the same one used in the album version, and the sax solo is up-front and bright.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen Drive All Night #1 Original Version\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uFm3Y9-BYIs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>If you&#8217;re lucky enough to catch &#8220;Drive All Night&#8221; live in concert, it&#8217;s bound to be the highlight of the night. The song breathes and builds and bursts with emotion, especially on the recent River tour.</p>\n<p>I chased this song for years and finally landed it in <a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/08/23/where-the-band-was-st-louis-august-23-2008/\">St. Louis in 2008</a>&#8211;and then somehow managed to be present at four more shows (out of a total of only 11) where it was played between then and 2014. I&#8217;ve now heard it live a total of fourteen times, and it never loses its power of transport.</p>\n<p>Here are two of my favorite live performances:</p>\n<p>The first features just Bruce, Steve, and Clarence playing acoustically in 2005. Steve&#8217;s acoustic six-string laces the determined vocals with delicacy and fragility, and the effect is gorgeous&#8211;this may be my favorite arrangement of the song.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Drive All Night Bruce Springsteen, Little Steven, and &quot;BIG MAN&quot; Clarence Clemons 11/19/2005 FL\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nj0W84Y624c?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8230;but my all-time favorite performance is from the second night of three in Los Angeles in 2016. I don&#8217;t know what sparked it, but the band&#8217;s performance was transcendent (Jake does his uncle proud), and both Bruce and the crowd recognized it. Bruce stretched the song out even longer than usual to a full twelve minutes, building coda upon coda as the audience broke out their lighters and cellphones, lighting up the arena in a beautiful moment of community. You can see it happen shortly after the ten-minute mark.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Drive All Night - Bruce Springsteen - Los Angeles Sports Arena - 19th March 2016\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/c9g0jM7KDy4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>That final minute, with the band aglow and the audience rapt and Bruce refusing to end the song&#8211;that minute is one of my favorite minutes at a Springsteen show.</p>\n<p>Or as Bruce says as the final bars fade, &#8220;That&#8217;s nice.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Drive All Night<br />\nRecorded: </strong>1977 (music), 1980 (vocals)<strong><br />\nReleased:\u00a0</strong><em>The River</em> (1980)<strong><br />\nFirst performed: </strong>October 18, 1980 (St. Louis, MO)<strong><br />\nLast performed: </strong>January 27, 2017 (Perth, Australia)</p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
