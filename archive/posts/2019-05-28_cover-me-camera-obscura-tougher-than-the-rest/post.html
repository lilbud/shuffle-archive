<p>A fascinating thing happens when a heterosexual woman sings “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/08/08/roll-of-the-dice-tougher-than-the-rest/">Tougher Than the Rest</a>.”</p>
<p>When you swap the genders of the singer and the addressee, but you keep the rest of the lyrics intact, the song transforms.</p>
<p>In Bruce’s <a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/08/08/album-companion-tunnel-of-love/"><em>Tunnel of Love</em></a> original, the singer is a self-aware, world-weary man who realizes he isn’t every girl’s dream, but who pledges to be true and constant.</p>
<p>When Tracyanne Campbell sings it, though (or <a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/05/09/cover-me-shawn-colvin-tougher-than-the-rest/">Shawn Colvin</a>, or <a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/09/19/cover-me-everything-but-the-girl-tougher-than-the-rest/">Tracey Thorn</a>, or <a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/02/15/cover-me-martina-linn-tougher-than-the-rest/">Martina Linn</a>, who likewise bring new meaning to the song), she doesn’t <em>want</em> every girl’s dream boy. She wants something true, meaningful, and lasting. And just like that, the song changes, but it’s just as powerfully romantic.</p>

<p>It’s a beautiful cover by Traceyanne’s band Camera Obscura, and you can find it on the B-side of their 2009 single, “The Sweetest Thing.”</p>
