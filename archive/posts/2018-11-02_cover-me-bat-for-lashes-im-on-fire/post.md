Here’s a cover that should stop you in your tracks.

Bat For Lashes (Natasha Khan) completely co-opts “[I’m on Fire,](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/09/11/roll-of-the-dice-im-on-fire/)” preserving its sexual tension but completely transforming it into something more spiritual and more human than Bruce’s baser original.

Carried by an instrumental track that’s all piano, strings, and marxophone–and absolutely no percussion–Khan’s rendition of “I’m on Fire” is searingly yearning from start to finish.
