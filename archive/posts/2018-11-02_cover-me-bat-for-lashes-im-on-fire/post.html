<p>Bat For Lashes (Natasha Khan) completely co-opts “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/09/11/roll-of-the-dice-im-on-fire/">I’m on Fire,</a>” preserving its sexual tension but completely transforming it into something more spiritual and more human than Bruce’s baser original.</p>
<p>Carried by an instrumental track that’s all piano, strings, and marxophone–and absolutely no percussion–Khan’s rendition of “I’m on Fire” is searingly yearning from start to finish.</p>
