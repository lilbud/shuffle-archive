Let's get this out of the way first: the typo is Patti's, not mine. Every time I see "Loves Glory" without an apostrophe, on the album cover or anywhere else in print, it drives me nuts. But hey, she's the artist, so she can name her songs however she likes.

Okay, I feel better now. Onward:

Readers of this blog know that I hold Patti Scialfa in high esteem as an artist in her own right. Her three solo albums are wonderful, particularly her most recent one from 2007, *Play It as It Lays,* which I think is the superior release from the Springsteen/Scialfa household that year. And yes, *Magic* is a fantastic album, so that tells you just how much I think of *Play It as It Lays*.

And while I realize that some Springsteen fans don't particularly take to her vocal stylings, I wonder if they've listened to tracks like "Loves Glory."

Originally released on her debut *Rumble Doll* album (her second best, in my opinion), "Loves Glory" features what may be Patti's finest-ever vocal performance.

Beautiful, resolute, and unabashedly romantic, Patti takes flight just past the two-minute mark with soaring vocals that still give me goosebumps every time I listen.

And no, her husband appears nowhere on the track.

So why am I featuring it on a Bruce-focused blog? Because one time only, back in the winter of 1998, Bruce did in fact join Patti for a performance of "Loves Glory" at a benefit concert in Red Bank.

You won't hear his voice, but you can hear Bruce on backing guitar in the live recording below. But trust me, don't pay attention to Bruce on this one. He's superfluous here–this is Patti's star turn.

It's been more than a dozen years since Patti's last album; I think we're more than due for a new one.

And since Bruce doesn't seem to be quite ready to tour yet, is it too much to ask for a few solo Scialfa shows?
