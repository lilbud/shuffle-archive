<p>What do Bruce Springsteen and Tori Amos have in common?</p>
<p>Quite a bit, actually:</p>
<ul>
<li>They’re both singer/songwriters with vast catalogs that span decades.</li>
<li>They’re both known for their wildly unpredictable setlists and fervent fan bases.</li>
<li>They both have a encyclopedic appreciation of rock and are known for their inspired cover interpretations</li>
<li>They each have a great song entitled “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/02/27/roll-of-the-dice-drive-all-night/">Drive All Night</a>.”</li>
<li>They both have borderline obsessive fans who analyze virtually every lyric they ever wrote.</li>
</ul>
<p>And as it turns out, all of the above serve as context for explaining why this <em>Cover Me</em> installment is very different from the rest of this series.</p>
<p>Efrain and David, the hosts of the “Drive All Night: The Songs of Tori Amos” podcast, recently invited me to be a guest on their show during a two-hour(!) episode devoted entirely to Tori’s cover of Bruce’s “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/09/11/roll-of-the-dice-im-on-fire/">I’m on Fire</a>.”</p>

<p>You read that right: a two-hour podcast devoted to a Tori Amos cover of a Bruce Springsteen song. How could I pass that up?</p>
<p>Well, I couldn’t, of course. My conversation with Efraim is only one segment of wide-ranging episode, but I had a blast getting introduced to Tori Amos super-fandom!</p>
<p>So instead of my usual commentary here, If you’ve got 110 minutes or so, take a  listen to Efrain and David discovering and analyzing both Bruce’s and Tori’s versions of “I’m on Fire,” along with my comparative thoughts, and let me know what you think.</p>

<p>Efrain and David feel like kindred spirits to me: they’re deep into their mission to profile every song that Tori Amos has ever recorded, including the covers, and boy are they <em>thorough</em>. Each episode features a line-by-line analysis, notable covers, great live performances, and more. When they tackle Tori covering another artist, they invite a “superfan” (their word, not mine) of the original artist to provide comparative context and commentary.</p>
<p>Efrain and I had a great conversation; it was fascinating to talk to someone so interested to learn all about Bruce but who was a relatively blank Springsteen slate. For my part, I learned a lot about what Bruce and Tori fans have in common, discovered some great covers of “I’m on Fire” that I hadn’t known about, and heard some outstanding Tori Amos live performances of Bruce’s music that flat-out floored me (including a cover of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/09/29/roll-of-the-dice-growin-up/">Growin’ Up</a>” that’s never been released but which you can hear during the show).</p>
<p>So thanks again, Efrain and David, for a great conversation, for an introduction to the Toriverse, and for adding a handful of great covers to my “to-blog” list!</p>
