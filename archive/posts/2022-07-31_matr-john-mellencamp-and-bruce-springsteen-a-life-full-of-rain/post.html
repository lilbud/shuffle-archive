<blockquote><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">“Bruce has a wonderful way of having humility and tenacity, all at the same time. He can get his ideas across with humility and an ability to do what he wants to do. He’s run his own band longer than I have, so I don’t have to say, ‘Hey Bruce, how about…?’ He says, ‘How about if I try this?’ and ‘How about if I try that?’ and, he’s Bruce Springsteen — sure, try it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">— John Mellencamp, <em>Cleveland.com</em>, February 7, 2022</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Word got out quickly.</p>
<p>First, the two were spotted at a local diner in Mellencamp’s Bloomington, Indiana stomping grounds in April 2021.</p>
<p>A month later, Mellencamp revealed Springsteen’s involvement during a pre-Grammy gala and an interview with <em>Billboard</em>.</p>
<p>In June, Bruce confirmed their collaboration during his <em>From My Home to Yours </em>radio show and a call-in to E Street Radio the next day. He told host Jim Rotolo, “I worked on three songs on John’s album, and I spent some time in Indiana with him. I love John a lot and he’s a great songwriter, and we’ve actually become very close. And I’ve had a lot of fun with him. So I sang a little bit on his music… he’s got a terrific record that I think is coming out in the fall, I think… you know, I’m not exactly sure.”</p>
<p>It took a little longer than that, but Mellencamp finally released <em>Strictly a One-Eyed Jack</em> in January 2022, and as promised it featured three Springsteen appearances. As the first single and video (and featuring duet vocals from Bruce), “Wasted Days” got all the buzz. “Did You Say Such a Thing” featured Bruce on backing vocals; it received considerably less notice.</p>
<p>Bruce’s third album appearance went almost completely under the radar.</p>

<p>“He’s playing guitar on ‘(A) Life Full of Rain,’ Mellencamp told MyRadioLink.com, “He’s playin’ the lead. ‘Cause Bruce started out as a lead guitar player — he wasn’t so much the singer of the band as he was the guitar player. So he had that ability to play that type of guitar.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t the first time Mellencamp praised Bruce’s melodic talents. While most fans and critics focus on his lyrics, Mellencamp had this to say to Howard Stern in 2018:</p>

<p>“A Life Full of Rain” is a moody and contemplative closing track, featuring gruff solo vocals from Mellencamp and an emotive Springsteen guitar solo unlike anything we’ve heard from him on his own albums.</p>

<p>It’s not the kind of track one would expect from either John or Bruce (let alone together), but it’s one that sticks with you long after the first listen.</p>
