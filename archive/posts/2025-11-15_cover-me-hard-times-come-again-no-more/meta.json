You know his songs even if you didn&#8217;t know he wrote them: &#8220;Oh! Susanna,&#8221; &#8220;Camptown Races,&#8221; &#8220;Swanee River,&#8221; and of course his 1854 classic &#8220;Hard Times Come Again No More.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"&quot;Hard Times Come Again No More&quot; (1905) - Edison Quartet\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SRMN0V4uxY4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>What many don&#8217;t realize is just how young Foster was when he wrote those songs. He was only 28 when he wrote &#8220;Hard Times&#8221;; he was only 22 when he wrote &#8220;Oh! Susanna.&#8221; He was just as much a prodigy in his time as Bruce Springsteen is in ours, writing more than 200 songs in his short life. (Foster died at the age of 37.)</p>\n<p>His influence lives on through today. &#8220;Hard Times Come Again No More&#8221; has been covered in the studio by Bob Dylan, Emmylou Harris, Nanci Griffith, Johnny Cash, Mavis Staples, and many more. And on stage, the list is even longer.</p>\n<p>Bruce is one of many artists who have covered Foster in concert. During his Working on a Dream Tour in recession-era 2009, &#8220;Hard Times Come Again No More&#8221; was a nightly encore staple, a song of resilience and solidarity&#8211;two evergreen Springsteen themes. One memorable performance was captured on his <em>London Calling: Live in Hyde Park</em> concert film.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Hard Times (Come Again No More) (London Calling: Live In Hyde Park, 2009)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8nLDj-Vn3AQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Bruce changed very little of Foster&#8217;s lyrics (although he dropped a couple of verses), but that was a late-breaking decision. Backstage at Bruce&#8217;s first rehearsal show, <em>Los Angeles Times</em> reporter Geoff Boucher observed a notebook opened to\u00a0 a page with Foster&#8217;s original lyrics, with large chunks changed and modernized before Bruce changed his mind and decided to go with the original version.</p>\n<p>But if his lyrics are traditional, Bruce&#8217;s arrangement is a departure. He dials up the emotion in the pleading chorus, and with the help of his backing vocalists he transforms the song almost into gospel.</p>\n<p>Bruce and the E Street Band performed Foster&#8217;s song throughout the entire tour but not once since, even though it&#8217;s more relevant today than ever. Let&#8217;s hope it won&#8217;t be by the time Bruce gets back out on the road again next year.</p>\n<p><strong>Hard Times Come Again No More<br />\nFirst performed:</strong> March 23, 2009 (Asbury Park, NJ)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> November 20, 2009 (Baltimore, MD)</p>\n<p>(c) January 21, 2022</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>At the height of the Great Recession, Bruce heartened his audiences with a nightly encore of Stephen Foster&#8217;s 1854 classic.</p>\n", "protected": false}, "author": 1, "featured_media": 32443, "comment_status": "open", "ping_status": "open", "sticky": false, "template": "", "format": "standard", "meta": {"_monsterinsights_skip_tracking": false, "_monsterinsights_sitenote_active": false, "_monsterinsights_sitenote_note": "", "_monsterinsights_sitenote_category": 0, "jetpack_post_was_ever_published": false, "_jetpack_newsletter_access": "", "_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs": false, "_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id": 0, "_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content": false, "_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content": false, "footnotes": "", "jetpack_publicize_message": "", "jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled": true, "jetpack_social_post_already_shared": true, "jetpack_social_options": {"image_generator_settings": {"template": "highway", "default_image_id": 0, "font": "", "enabled": false}, "version": 2}}, "categories": [4, 3603], "tags": [3393, 3394], "class_list": ["post-32365", "post", "type-post", "status-publish", "format-standard", "has-post-thumbnail", "hentry", "category-cover-me", "category-encore", "tag-hard-times-come-again-no-more", "tag-stephen-foster"], "aioseo_notices": [], "jetpack_publicize_connections": [], "jetpack_featured_media_url": "https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/hardtimessmall.jpg?fit=2047%2C2048&ssl=1", "jetpack_sharing_enabled": true, "jetpack_shortlink": "https://wp.me/p9w3Lk-8q1", "jetpack_likes_enabled": true, "jetpack-related-posts": [{"id": 6282, "url": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/12/23/meeting-across-the-river-southside-johnny-and-bruce-springsteen-trapped-again/", "url_meta": {"origin": 32365, "position": 0}, "title": "MatR: Southside Johnny and Bruce Springsteen, Trapped Again", "author": "Ken", "date": "December 23, 2018", "format": false, "excerpt": "Bruce co-wrote \"Trapped Again\" with Southside Johnny and Steve Van Zandt, but he's only performed it live once.
