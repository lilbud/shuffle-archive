On January 31, 1998, Jersey met Jersey:

At a benefit concert for the memorial fund for a local police officer killed a few months prior, Bruce Springsteen and Jon Bon Jovi shared vocals on one of Bon Jovi's signature songs:

Although Bruce had shared the stage with Jon Bon Jovi several times as far back as 1980, this was the first time the two performed one of Bon Jovi's own songs together.

"Wanted Dead or Alive" was a fine choice for their first Bon Jovi-penned outing. Released more than a decade earlier as the third single of the band's megahit album *Slippery When Wet*, "Wanted" peaked at #7 and became one of Bon Jovi's signature songs.

With its western outlaw theme, it's easy to see why it appealed to Bruce, and why he so fully committed to it.

To date, however, this remains the only time Bruce has performed "Wanted Dead or Alive."
