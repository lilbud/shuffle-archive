That makes no sense taken either literally or metaphorically, and it&#8217;s always bugged me about this song.</p>\n<p>Sorry. Let&#8217;s continue.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I&#8217;ll be there to guide you when trouble walks beside you</em><br />\n<em>If you need me I&#8217;ll be there</em><br />\n<em>And when this dirty world has been cold to you</em><br />\n<em>I got two strong arms waitin&#8217; to hold you</em><br />\n<em>And when those mean days come along</em><br />\n<em>We&#8217;ll stand together and we&#8217;ll take &#8217;em on</em><br />\n<em>So if you need me just call my name</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>When you need me call my name</em><br />\n<em>&#8216;Cause without you my life just isn&#8217;t the same</em><br />\n<em>&#8216;Cause when this world kicked me around</em><br />\n<em>Baby you picked me up off the ground</em><br />\n<em>So if you need me I&#8217;ll be there</em></p>\n<p>I really want to find some substance to break down and analyze (I don&#8217;t feel like I&#8217;m doing my job otherwise), but what we hear is pretty much all we get.</p>\n<p>Even musically, Bruce made some questionable decisions. At the beginning, and underneath throughout, we hear a lovely, modest backing track that&#8217;s 100% Bruce, but when Bruce dusted off the track for his <em>Tracks </em>box set a decade after recording it, he felt the need to add drums. The song is not the better for it.</p>\n<p>When the time came to assemble the final album, Bruce wisely chose to keep &#8220;When You Need Me&#8221; off of it. Even the more straightforward love songs on\u00a0<em>Tunnel of Love</em> have some complexity to them&#8211;the pure poppiness of &#8220;When You Need Me&#8221; would have stood out by comparison.</p>\n<p>If it seems like I&#8217;m hating on &#8220;When You Need Me,&#8221; I&#8217;m not. It&#8217;s hard to take issue with a song this light and sweet, but that&#8217;s sort of the problem with it: it&#8217;s just okay. There&#8217;s nothing to particularly admire or especially hate, and as a result the song is essentially forgettable.</p>\n<p>Which is exactly how Bruce seems to have treated it: &#8220;When You Need Me&#8221; has never received a concert outing and probably won&#8217;t barring a fan&#8217;s sign request (which isn&#8217;t likely to happen, either). Very probably, &#8220;When You Need Me&#8221; will remain an inoffensive, largely forgotten outtake.</p>\n<p><strong>Update #1: </strong>Astute reader Yoli Clavero noted that while Bruce hasn&#8217;t performed &#8220;When You Need Me&#8221; in concert, he did rehearse it way back on March 30, 1993. Here&#8217;s that recording below. Gracias, Yoli!</p>\n<audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-15843-2\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/14-When-You-Need-Me.mp3?_=2\" /><a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/14-When-You-Need-Me.mp3\">http://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/14-When-You-Need-Me.mp3</a></audio>\n<p><strong>Update</strong> #2: I&#8217;m humbled today by how sharp my readers are&#8211;Magnus Lauglo noticed that in the last verse, the tense shifts to the present: &#8220;&#8217;cause without you my life just isn&#8217;t the same.&#8221; That implies that &#8220;When You Need Me&#8221; is more than just a sweet love song; it&#8217;s a song about the bond that persists even after a relationship ends. It deepens the song considerably, and I may have to upgrade my opinion of the song as a result.
