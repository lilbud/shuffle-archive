“A friend of mine bought me a ticket to see Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band at Murphy Center in Murfreesboro, Tennessee on the Born in the U.S.A. Tour. We went out there, and Bruce walked out that night and sang ‘Born in the U.S.A.’ right out of the box. Three hours and fifteen minutes later, I walked out into the Tennessee night, and I knew exactly what to do. I went home and wrote ‘Guitar Town.'” — *Steve Earle, December 4, 2016*

It was the evening of December 9, 1984, at an otherwise unremarkable show on the Born in the U.S.A. Tour.

But even a “standard” Springsteen show has the power to inspire great art and great artists, and Steve Earle credits that show at Middle Tennessee State University with opening his eyes to the power of rock and roll and sending him down a lifelong path from that moment on. (In truth, though, Earle had already been performing for a decade and recording for a couple of years as a country artist.)

Still, Earle did write “Guitar Town” shortly thereafter as the title song and lead single for his 1986 debut album, and it became a country rock hit, notching the number seven spot on the Billboard Country chart and earning Earle Grammy nominations in both the “Best Country Song” and “Best Male Country Vocalist” categories.

Twelve years after its release, Earle finally got a chance to perform “Guitar Town” with the man who inspired it. When Earle played at Tradewinds on the Jersey Shore, local boy Bruce Springsteen dropped by to catch the show.

Earle invited Bruce to join his band on stage for the encore set, and Bruce ended up staying through six songs, all on guitar and occasional backing vocals. Of course, one of those songs had to be “Guitar Town,” and you can hear him here on guitar.

That was the only time Bruce has ever performed “Guitar Town.” For more one-time-only Earle/Springsteen performances, check out the other songs they played that night .
