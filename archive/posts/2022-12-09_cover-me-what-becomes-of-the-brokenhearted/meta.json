More than a hit, in fact. In the years since it peaked at #7 on the Billboard Hot 100 (and #8 in the U.K.) this 1966 classic earned itself a place amongst Motown&#8217;s most beloved songs. That&#8217;s largely due to Jimmy Ruffin&#8217;s incredible vocal performance that rightfully made it his breakthrough (and sadly career best) single.</p>\n<p>It became such a favorite, in fact, that Motown re-released the single in the U.K. eight years later&#8211;and the re-release actually performed <em>better</em>, peaking at #4.</p>\n<p>(Fun fact: the unusually long instrumental introduction is due to the last-minute removal of the song&#8217;s original first verse, which was spoken by Ruffin rather than sung. You can listen to it below.)</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"What Becomes Of The Brokenhearted (Alternate Mix With Spoken Intro)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/c7gCblGuZgw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Many notable artists have found themselves unable to resist the temptation to cover this mournful standard, including Joan Osborne, Dave Stewart and Colin Blunstone, Robson &amp; Jerome, and Paul Young, who took his cover to #22 in 1991.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"What Becomes Of The Broken Hearted\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FGDJSTwU4U8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Bruce Springsteen is the latest cover artist to step up to the plate. Like the rest of <em>Only the Strong Survive,\u00a0</em>his version of &#8220;What Becomes of the Brokenhearted&#8221; is faithful to the original. Refreshingly, though, it features some subtle enhancements that differentiate it in a positive way.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - What Becomes of the Brokenhearted (Official Audio)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fo8H_m11awI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Bruce and producer/multi-instrumentalist Ron Aniello wisely recognize that no matter who performs it, this song is all about the vocals. Even so, Aniello expands and brightens the sound, emphasizing strings and chimes to give the song a hopeful note in a sea of dolefulness.</p>\n<p>It works, because while &#8220;What Becomes of the Brokenhearted&#8221; is certainly a lament, it&#8217;s also a pledge to keep going, to keep searching for someone&#8211;<em>anyone</em>&#8211;to love and be loved by. Bruce seems to recognize that too: he extends the outro and perseverates on the narrator&#8217;s determination to somehow find a way to love again. It&#8217;s a perfect moment, one perfectly suited for his innate ability to channel heartbreak and resilience simultaneously.</p>\n<p>On an album that&#8217;s all about his vocal performances, &#8220;What Becomes of the Brokenhearted&#8221; features one of Springsteen&#8217;s strongest.</p>\n<p><strong>What Becomes of the Broken Hearted<br />\nRecorded:</strong> 2021<br />\n<strong>Released:</strong>\u00a0<em>Only the Strong Survive\u00a0</em>(2022)<br />\n<strong>Never performed</strong></p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
