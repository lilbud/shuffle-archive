In their heightened emotional state, Regeney and Shayne were profoundly affected by the sight of the babies, who were gazing and smiling at each other angelically.</p>\n<p>War might have seemed imminent, but in that moment they saw hope for peace. Regeney thought the babies reminded him of little lambs, and a song was born.</p>\n<p>Regeney was a lapsed Catholic; his wife and songwriting partner Shayne was Jewish. Neither ever intended to write a Christmas song, even though Regeney intentionally coopted Christian imagery for his lyrics.</p>\n<p>Intended or not, &#8220;Do You Hear What I Hear&#8221; became an immensely popular holiday song, and arguably the most misunderstood.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Do You Hear What I Hear?

No doubt in part due to its timing, the listening public glommed onto the surface of &#8220;Do You Hear What I Hear&#8221; and missed the subtext.</p>\n<p>The lyricist who once swore he&#8217;d never write a Christmas song suddenly found himself responsible for one of the biggest hits of the holiday season. And when Bing Crosby released a cover of it during the one-year anniversary of the Cuban Missile Crisis, &#8220;Do You Hear What I Hear&#8221; was cemented as an eternal holiday hit.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bing Crosby - Do You Hear What I Hear?

Well, make that <a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/12/24/matr-sting-bruce-springsteen-and-friends-joy-to-the-world/\">one traditional carol</a> and one misinterpreted one:
