That means I&#8217;m falling further behind instead of catching up, so let&#8217;s not waste any more time before diving into today&#8217;s stellar selections.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s start with the highest-profile of the bunch: the Juno-winning, Canadian indie-pop band, Walk Off the Earth. With over four million YouTube subscribers and videos with as many as 190 million views, &#8220;high profile&#8221; is not an understatement.</p>\n<p>Their fresh new cover of &#8220;Dancing in the Dark&#8221; is (IMHO) the most infectious of today&#8217;s entrants,&nbsp; with an acoustic arrangement that accomplishes the impressive task of being almost as exciting as Bruce&#8217;s electric performances in concert. (Well, maybe not&nbsp;<em>almost</em>, but pretty darn fun nonetheless.)</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Dancing In The Dark - Walk off The Earth (Springsteen Cover)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dpyqgkIxLDk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;Dancing in the Dark&#8221; doesn&#8217;t always have to be exciting, though. At its core, it&#8217;s a song about loneliness and yearning for connection, a theme that Scotland-based Billy Reekie and Cara McBride dial directly into with their affecting duet set against a piano-led arrangement.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Dancing In The Dark Bruce Springsteen cover by Billy Reekie &amp; Cara Mcbride\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GMPM7h7_rPw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Billy and Cara may be sitting side-by-side in the video, but close your eyes and you&#8217;ll hear two lonely souls longing for each other. It&#8217;s a beautiful performance that highlights the versatility of Bruce&#8217;s songwriting.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s linger a little in Europe and check out Jack Jarryd&#8217;s cover from his recent appearance on the Dutch radio station Qmusic. Jack&#8217;s version of &#8220;Dancing in the Dark&#8221; is the most true-to-the-eighties of the bunch, while still managing to sound fresh and timely.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Jack Jarryd - Dancing In The Dark (Bruce Springsteen cover live at Qmusic)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dhZTwdc7Lg8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Jack isn&#8217;t the only Dutch artist in today&#8217;s round-up; he&#8217;s joined by The Starlings, who also made a recent in-studio appearance and likewise performed Bruce Springsteen&#8217;s greatest hit. Their version starts out similar to Billy and Cara&#8217;s&#8211;intimate and contemplative&#8211;but around the one-minute mark, the strings enter and infuse the band&#8217;s performance with beauty and tenderness. This is a very nice cover.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"The Starlings - Dancing In The Dark (Bruce Springsteen cover) | NPO Radio 2\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PQD5V-6KrLM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Let&#8217;s end with something a little different: a cool, jazzy arrangement by 48th Street Collective, who specialize in reinventing popular songs in a format you&#8217;d expect to hear in a smoky lounge rather than a concert arena. Their version of &#8220;Dancing in the Dark&#8221; may be the least faithful to the song&#8217;s theme and message, but it sure is fun.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe
