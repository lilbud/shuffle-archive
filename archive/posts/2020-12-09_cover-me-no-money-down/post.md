meta-description: You’ve heard snippets in River-era bootlegs, but if you haven’t heard the one and only recording of Bruce’s full cover of “No Money Down” from way back in 1974, you need to listen to this definitive version inside.

With its instantly recognizable (if not original) stop-time riff and sly, comical, almost spoken-word lyrics, “No Money Down,” Chuck Berry’s 1957 hit single (it peaked at #8 on Billboard’s R&B chart) was all but calling out for Bruce to cover it in concert.

And cover it he did, often and famously, during the River Tour–but only in part (it was never the full song, just select verses and lyrics, often tailored to local TV car dealer commercials).

Slow and sultry, Bruce’s 1980 homage kicked off his show’s second set, building suspense before breaking into the uptempo “.”

But while most fans know the playful 1980 versions (thanks to the official release of the Tempe 1980 concert from which the clip above hails), not many have heard the one recording we have of Bruce covering “No Money Down” in full–from more than six years earlier at The Bottom Line in New York City on the Wild and Innocent Tour, on July 13, 1974

This version is longer, bluesier, and captures Bruce in full street punk mode. The recording may not be as clear as the Tempe ’80 version, but the performance is a whole lot hotter, especially Bruce’s sizzling guitar solo.

Take a listen to Bruce’s cover of “No Money Down” below.
