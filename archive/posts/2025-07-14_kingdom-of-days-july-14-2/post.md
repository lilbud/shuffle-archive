[Watch on Youtube: Hard Rock Calling 2012 Bruce Springsteen - TV Advert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg3fySaCohI)

It starts with a surprise guest appearance by Bruce during John Fogerty's set:

[Watch on Youtube: Springsteen And Fogerty - Rockin' All Over The World - Hyde Park, London, Jul 14, 2012](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyQ6mN2EhWY)

...and things pick up during Bruce's set: Bruce and Roy open by themselves, playing "Thunder Road" like they did at Bruce's legendary Hammersmith Odeon show in 1975.

Guest appearances by Tom Morello and John Fogerty quickly follow, along with the tour premiere of the very rare "[Take 'Em as They Come](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/03/29/roll-of-the-dice-take-em-as-they-come/)."

But it's the encore surprise that garners worldwide headlines, when Bruce invites Sir Paul McCartney to join him on stage for "[I Saw Her Standing There](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/09/11/matr-bruce-springsteen-george-harrison-ringo-starr-mick-jagger-and-billy-joel-i-saw-her-standing-there/)" and "Twist and Shout."

Unfortunately, and mystifyingly, the festival staff pull the plug on Bruce, Paul, and the band when they sail past their 10:30pm curfew. Unable to close the show in his customary fashion, Bruce merely sings a brief "[Goodnight Irene](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/08/01/matr-pete-seeger-and-bruce-springsteen-goodnight-irene/)" and exits. (The broadcast clip above ends before the power cut, but you can watch the unedited footage below to see how it played out.)
