<p>Tucked away at the end of Side One of that album is a gorgeous duet with Mac McAnally called “Gulf Coast Highway,” that sounds for all the world like a Bruce Springsteen song.</p>

<p>In fact, with lyrics like these, “Gulf Coast Highway” would be right at home on <em>The Ghost of Tom Joad </em>(even though that album was still seven years in the future):</p>
<p><em>Gulf coast highway, he worked the rails</em><br/>
<em>He worked the rice fields with their cold dark wells</em><br/>
<em>He worked the oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico</em><br/>
<em>The only thing we’ve owned is this old house here by the road</em></p>
<p><em>…</em></p>
<p><em>Highway 90, the jobs are gone</em><br/>
<em>We kept our garden, we set the sun</em><br/>
<em>This is the only place on Earth blue bonnets grow</em><br/>
<em>And once a year they come and go</em><br/>
<em>At this old house here by the road</em></p>
<p>Bruce was apparently taken with the song, because not long after the song’s release, he soundchecked it at least once. The recording below is from a soundcheck sometime during his stand at Madison Square Garden in 1988. Take a listen–it’s a beautiful arrangement featuring Patti’s lovely backing vocals.</p>

<p>Too bad Bruce bluffs some of the vocals; this is one cover I’d love to have a true recording of.</p>
