It&#8217;s full of gorgeous, faithful vocal renditions of both classic and lesser-known R&amp;B songs.</p>\n<p>But despite its subtitle, I&#8217;d argue that it&#8217;s not so much a covers album as a vocals album, designed to highlight Springsteen as soul crooner rather than interpreter. Every song hews faithfully to its original arrangement. There&#8217;s no reason to listen to any of the tracks except to hear what the song sounds like with Bruce&#8217;s voice singing it.</p>\n<p>If we listen to &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/08/05/roll-of-the-dice-cover-me-trapped/\">Trapped</a>,&#8221; &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/07/24/cover-me-roll-of-the-dice-jersey-girl/\">Jersey Girl,</a>&#8221; or anything from the <a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/07/17/album-companion-we-shall-overcome/\">Seeger Sessions era</a>, by contrast, we glean a true appreciation for Bruce&#8217;s ability to reinvigorate a song that was already great to begin with.</p>\n<p>Which is why it&#8217;s so refreshing to hear Bruce&#8217;s rendition of Jesse Malin&#8217;s &#8220;She Don&#8217;t Love Me Now,&#8221;<br />\na return to form for Bruce and a fitting tribute to <a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/?s=jesse+malin\">an artist we&#8217;ve featured here many times before</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen/Jesse Malin - She Don&#039;t Love Me Now (Official Visualizer)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gLK-Z9QilVk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Bruce and Jesse have performed many of Malin&#8217;s songs on stage together over the years. Bruce even appears on the studio version of &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/08/17/matr-jesse-malin-and-bruce-springsteen-broken-radio/\">Broken Radio</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>So why did Bruce choose to cover a song the pair have never performed? I&#8217;m guessing it has something to do with the original track&#8217;s production. Recorded for Malin&#8217;s 2015 album, <em>New York Before the War</em>, &#8220;She Don&#8217;t Love Me Now&#8221; is clearly influenced by the classic Stax sound. Even without Jesse&#8217;s admission in recent interviews, we can hear it almost immediately in the backing horns, an unusual presence in a Jesse Malin song.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Jesse Malin - She Don&#039;t Love Me Now (Official Music Video)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6-5mB3gs8b8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Now if we listen to Jesse&#8217;s original and Bruce&#8217;s cover back-to-back, at first blush they might not sound that different. But they certainly&nbsp;<em>feel</em> different, don&#8217;t they?</p>\n<p>Jesse&#8217;s version is loose and laid back. He shambles his way through the song, planting a foot squarely on each downbeat like the inebriated lovelorn narrator we imagine.</p>\n<p>Bruce, on the other hand, struts his way through a slightly syncopated vocal performance, lending an element of funk to the proceedings and leaning into the &#8220;other fish in the sea&#8221; vibe of the song&#8217;s third verse. And oh, that sax solo that stretches across the song&#8217;s final minute&#8211;it&#8217;s one of my favorite Jake Clemons moments on record, and it emotionally anchors the song in a long-ago era.</p>\n<p>Both versions are splendid in their own way. Both belong in the collection of any fan of either artist devoted enough to be reading this blog.</p>\n<p>So go out and get the album it appears on:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://glassnote.ffm.to/prisonersofparadise\"><em>Silver Patron Saints: The Songs of Jesse Malin</em> </a>releases on September 20, 2024, and the proceeds go to Jesse&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.sweetrelief.org/jessemalinfund.html\">Sweet Relief</a> fund to help cover the costs of his recovery from a tragic and rare spinal stroke last year that left him paralyzed from the waist down&#8211;an exceptionally cruel blow for such a physical performer.</p>\n<p>Besides Springsteen, the album features covers by Bleachers, Counting Crows, Elvis Costello, Lucinda Williams, The Wallflowers, Low Cut Connie, Susanna Hoffs, Alejandro Escovedo and a host of other amazing artists&#8211;many of whom will be present when Jesse returns to the stage for the first time this December in New York City.</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t miss it.</p>\n<p><strong>She Don&#8217;t Love Me Now</strong><br />\n<strong>Recorded:</strong> 2024<br />\n<strong>Released:</strong>&nbsp;<em>Silver Patron Saints: The Songs of Jesse Malin</em> (2024)<br />\n<strong>Never performed</strong></p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>A return to form for Bruce as a cover artist and a fitting tribute for an artist we&#8217;ve featured here may times before. </p>\n", "protected": false}, "author": 1, "featured_media": 54353, "comment_status": "open", "ping_status": "open", "sticky": false, "template": "", "format": "standard", "meta": {"_monsterinsights_skip_tracking": false, "_monsterinsights_sitenote_active": false, "_monsterinsights_sitenote_note": "", "_monsterinsights_sitenote_category": 0, "jetpack_post_was_ever_published": false, "_jetpack_newsletter_access": "", "_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs": false, "_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id": 0, "_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content": false, "_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content": false, "footnotes": "", "jetpack_publicize_message": "", "jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled": true, "jetpack_social_post_already_shared": true, "jetpack_social_options": {"image_generator_settings": {"template": "highway", "default_image_id": 0, "font": "", "enabled": false}, "version": 2}}, "categories": [4], "tags": [370, 63, 3599, 3598], "class_list": ["post-54352", "post", "type-post", "status-publish", "format-standard", "has-post-thumbnail", "hentry", "category-cover-me", "tag-jake-clemons", "tag-jesse-malin", "tag-she-dont-love-me-now", "tag-silver-patron-saints"], "aioseo_notices": [], "jetpack_publicize_connections": [], "jetpack_featured_media_url": "https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/shedontlovemenow.jpg?fit=1280%2C720&ssl=1", "jetpack_sharing_enabled": true, "jetpack_shortlink": "https://wp.me/p9w3Lk-e8E", "jetpack_likes_enabled": true, "jetpack-related-posts": [{"id": 16921, "url": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/03/27/cover-me-billy-mann-two-hearts/", "url_meta": {"origin": 54352, "position": 0}, "title": "Cover Me, Billy Mann: Two Hearts", "author": "Ken", "date": "March 27, 2020", "format": false, "excerpt": "Released on an EP of outtakes from a Springsteen tribute album, Billy Mann's gorgeous cover of \"Two Hearts\" couldn't be more under-the-radar.
