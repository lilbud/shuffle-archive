<p>Because of course you’ve always wondered what a chiptuned Bruce Springsteen song sounds like. Right?</p>
<p>Actually, chiptune adaptations of Bruce’s catalog have been floating around the Internet for many years. But until now, every one I’ve come across is a novelty at best–certainly not worth a repeat listen.</p>
<p>Until now.</p>
<p>The 8-Bit Arcade team gets points for the sheer audaciousness of even <em>attempting</em> to adapt and cover such a lush and layered song as “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/03/28/roll-of-the-dice-western-stars/">Western Stars</a>.” But to actually pull it off so superbly? That is a super-impressive feat. They even nailed the pedal steel!</p>
<p>So without further ado, take a listen to the 8-Bit Arcade cover of “Western Stars,” and prepare to be impressed.</p>
