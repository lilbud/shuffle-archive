Because of course you've always wondered what a chiptuned Bruce Springsteen song sounds like. Right?

Actually, chiptune adaptations of Bruce's catalog have been floating around the Internet for many years. But until now, every one I've come across is a novelty at best–certainly not worth a repeat listen.

Until now.

The 8-Bit Arcade team gets points for the sheer audaciousness of even *attempting* to adapt and cover such a lush and layered song as "[Western Stars](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/03/28/roll-of-the-dice-western-stars/)." But to actually pull it off so superbly? That is a super-impressive feat. They even nailed the pedal steel!

So without further ado, take a listen to the 8-Bit Arcade cover of "Western Stars," and prepare to be impressed.
