He pointed around the arena, \u201cYou\u2019re looking good out there! In the back! Looking good up top!\u201d</p>\n<p>Then, \u201cC\u2019mon, C!\u201d During Clarence\u2019s solo, Bruce kept on with, \u201cShake it up there, waaay in the back,\u201d and I knew the dance was ours. I shouted, \u201cGo!!!\u201d and up we went!</p>\n<p>Bruce kicked into some \u201cold soul clapping\u201d and then laughed when he looked out and spotted Sharon, Rebecca, Anne, Bev, and me jumping around and dancing and waving.

I laughed and shrugged it off, but he went on to say you could see the band didn\u2019t know what was going on. Bruce probably didn\u2019t think a group of people could fit up there until he saw us dancing, so he spontaneously directed them to follow him. After that show, he occasionally brought the band out to that middle riser, so maybe my friend was right.</p>\n<p>Less than a week later, I was at the show in Auburn Hills and bumped into Max. We were chatting about his son, Jay, sitting in on drums, and I finally asked him how our dancing escapade looked from the stage. He said, \u201cThat was you?! Bruce loved it! He was talking about it after the show! The band loved it! It was great!\u201d</p>\n<p>I noticed security was guarding the middle riser during the show that night.</p>\n<p>Hilarious fun, indeed!</p>\n<div class=\"su-box su-box-style-default\" id=\"\"
