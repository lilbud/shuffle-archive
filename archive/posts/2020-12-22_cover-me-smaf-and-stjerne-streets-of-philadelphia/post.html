<p>I don’t know about any of that, but I do know that their recently released cover of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/06/30/roll-of-the-dice-streets-of-philadelphia/">Streets of Philadelphia</a>” (filmed in late 2019) is absolutely stunning.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-w-jcAkIRU">Watch on Youtube: Streets of Philadelphia (Cover) - Bruce Springsteen - SMAF-a-licious Session feat. Stjerne</a></p>
<p>That’s singer-songwriter Stjerne guesting on lead vocals. On her facebook page, she revealed that she sang this song for her grandmother, “a woman with a wonderful voice, as I was told. A woman with a fate that touched me a lot and triggers a strong feeling in me, even though I never met her.”</p>
<p>Stjerne’s vocals are filled with more longing than Bruce’s haunting original, and it’s every bit as powerful.</p>
