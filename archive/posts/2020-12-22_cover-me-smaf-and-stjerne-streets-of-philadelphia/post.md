SMAF is a German combo that describe their music as "a soundtrack Quentin Tarantino would dance to on acid at a soul music party," inspired by "spaghetti westerns, Motown, and reggae."

I don't know about any of that, but I do know that their recently released cover of "[Streets of Philadelphia](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/06/30/roll-of-the-dice-streets-of-philadelphia/)" (filmed in late 2019) is absolutely stunning.

That's singer-songwriter Stjerne guesting on lead vocals. On her facebook page, she revealed that she sang this song for her grandmother, "a woman with a wonderful voice, as I was told. A woman with a fate that touched me a lot and triggers a strong feeling in me, even though I never met her."

Stjerne's vocals are filled with more longing than Bruce's haunting original, and it's every bit as powerful.
