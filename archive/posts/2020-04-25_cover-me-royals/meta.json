Sounds like a song Bruce would write if he was a fifteen-year-old girl, doesn&#8217;t it?</p>\n<p>And then there are the lyrical changes. While Bruce subtly changed the lyrics throughout (mostly to make it first-person singular and add emphasis), he significantly changed the bridge and made the song very personal.</p>\n<p>Lorde&#8217;s original lyric is: &#8220;We&#8217;re bigger than we ever dreamed, and I&#8217;m in love with being queen.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Bruce sings:\u00a0&#8220;Long ago I was the next big thing; now I&#8217;m in love with being king.&#8221;</p>\n<p>More than anything else, that&#8217;s a giveaway that Bruce identified with Lorde and her conviction that one doesn&#8217;t need to sell out to sell
