meta-description: As much an anthem for Pittsburgh as anything Bruce ever wrote for New Jersey, “Pumping Iron” is a surefire setlist bet any time Joe Grushecky and Bruce play together.

In 1980, Joe Grushecky’s band, the Iron City Houserockers, were recording their second album, .

*Have a Good Time But Get Out Alive*

Steven Van Zandt produced and arranged five of the songs on that album (and played guitar on one), all while still working in the studio with the E Street Band on One night, Steve invited Joe to tag along and introduced him to Bruce. That, as they say, was the beginning of a long and beautiful friendship.

*The River.*

One of the songs that Steve did have a hand in but still ended up on the album was “Pumping Iron,” as much an anthem for Pittsburgh as anything Bruce ever wrote for New Jersey.

“Pumping Iron” couldn’t be more perfectly tailored for a Grushecky/Springsteen team-up, which is probably why they’ve performed it together almost two dozen times over the years (and probably more to come).

One the earliest of those performances was captured live on October 20, 1995, at Nick’s Fat City in Pittsburgh on the American Babylon Tour. It was officially released on Joe’s live album in 1999.

*Down the Road Apiece*

Take a listen to this superb recording of Joe Grushecky and The Houserockers (featuring Bruce Springsteen) performing “Pumping Iron.”

Bruce joined Joe and The Houserockers throughout their American Babylon Tour (otherwise known as the October Assault), and “Pumping Iron” featured prominently in the setlist.

Bruce and Joe would reprise it many times over the years that followed–although only in Pittsburgh or the Jersey Shore. Here are a couple performances from the Wonder Bar on July 18, 2015, and at Light of Day in January 2020. Both were fortunately captured from close-up.
