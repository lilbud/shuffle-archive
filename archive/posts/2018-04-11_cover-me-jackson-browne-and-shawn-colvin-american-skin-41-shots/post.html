<p>Jackson Browne and Shawn Colvin toured together a couple of years back. Both fans of Springsteen (Jackson and Bruce are longtime friends, and <a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/05/09/cover-me-shawn-colvin-tougher-than-the-rest/">Shawn recorded “Tougher Than the Rest”</a> for her 2015 covers album), it was pretty much a given for them to team up on a Bruce cover.</p>
<p>They chose “American Skin (41 Shots),” as timely then as it is now. Here’s a great performance of it from Golden Gate Park in October 2016.</p>
