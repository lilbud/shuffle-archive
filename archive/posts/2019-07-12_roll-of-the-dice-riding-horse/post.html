<p>(Side note: Good luck trying to find this song on youtube. Thanks to another well-known Springsteen who’s an equestrian star, searching for “Bruce Springsteen Riding Horse” does <em>not</em> yield desired results. So feel free to bookmark this for your repeat listening pleasure.)</p>
<p>So… yeah, this is basically just a short guy/tall girl song, and I’m <em>pretty</em> sure the horseback riding is euphemistic.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>I got a girl so tall and fair</em><br/>
<em>I need a stepladder to run my fingers through her hair</em><br/>
<em>I’m gonna kill the next guy who asks “how’s the weather up there?”</em><br/>
<em>Early on a Saturday night</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>She takes me on her riding horse</em><br/>
<em>I love the sound of her voice when she says “I love you so”</em><br/>
<em>Take me on your riding horse</em><br/>
<em>Come on baby, let’s giddy-up and go</em></p>
<p>See what I mean? And lest anyone accuse Bruce of subtlety, he erases that notion in the next verse:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Now Mister, I ain’t no hot-lovin’ clown</em><br/>
<em>There ain’t a man on the planet could cover all that ground</em><br/>
<em>Late at night she kisses me so sweet</em><br/>
<em>But I need a map to find my way from her lips to her feet</em></p>
<p>Yup, the chorus is a euphemism all right.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Baby take me on your riding horse</em><br/>
<em>I love the sound of your voice when you says I love you so</em><br/>
<em>Take me on your riding horse</em><br/>
<em>Come on baby lets giddy-up and go</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Take me for a pony ride</em><br/>
<em>I love your voice when you say “baby, it’s right”</em></p>
<p>For the life of me, I cannot fathom why Bruce left this off of <em>Nebraska</em>. Tight, polished lyrics, a great melody, and a relatively unplumbed theme. Go figure.</p>
<p>When the next tour comes, I think I know what my next sign request is gonna be.</p>
