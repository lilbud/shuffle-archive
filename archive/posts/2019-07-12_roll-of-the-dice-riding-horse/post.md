Let’s take a listen to a never-released outtake from Bruce Springsteen’s *Nebraska* sessions that’s especially, um, high concept.

(Side note: Good luck trying to find this song on youtube. Thanks to another well-known Springsteen who’s an equestrian star, searching for “Bruce Springsteen Riding Horse” does *not* yield desired results. So feel free to bookmark this for your repeat listening pleasure.)

So… yeah, this is basically just a short guy/tall girl song, and I’m *pretty* sure the horseback riding is euphemistic.

*I got a girl so tall and fair*  
*I need a stepladder to run my fingers through her hair*  
*I’m gonna kill the next guy who asks “how’s the weather up there?”*  
*Early on a Saturday night*

*She takes me on her riding horse*  
*I love the sound of her voice when she says “I love you so”*  
*Take me on your riding horse*  
*Come on baby, let’s giddy-up and go*

See what I mean? And lest anyone accuse Bruce of subtlety, he erases that notion in the next verse:

*Now Mister, I ain’t no hot-lovin’ clown*  
*There ain’t a man on the planet could cover all that ground*  
*Late at night she kisses me so sweet*  
*But I need a map to find my way from her lips to her feet*

Yup, the chorus is a euphemism all right.

*Baby take me on your riding horse*  
*I love the sound of your voice when you says I love you so*  
*Take me on your riding horse*  
*Come on baby lets giddy-up and go*

*Take me for a pony ride*  
*I love your voice when you say “baby, it’s right”*

For the life of me, I cannot fathom why Bruce left this off of *Nebraska*. Tight, polished lyrics, a great melody, and a relatively unplumbed theme. Go figure.

When the next tour comes, I think I know what my next sign request is gonna be.
