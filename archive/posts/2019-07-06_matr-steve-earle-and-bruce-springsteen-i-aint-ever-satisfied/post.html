<p>“I Ain’t Ever Satisfied” may never have the hit it deserved to be (it only peaked at #26 on the U.S. Mainstream Rock chart), but Earle’s fans still rank it as one of their favorites, and it’s still one of Earle’s most frequently performed songs.</p>

<p>With its defiant theme and wordless “Woh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh ” chorus, “I Ain’t Ever Satisfied” sounds tailor-made for a Springsteen cover or duet.</p>
<p>We got the latter when Bruce joined Steve Earle on stage during the encore set at Earle’s 1998 show at Tradewinds in Sea Bright, New Jersey.</p>
<p>Here’s that one-time only performance, from February 6, 1998. Bruce is on guitar the whole time, and you’ll hear his vocals kick in at around the halfway point.</p>
