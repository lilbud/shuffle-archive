When “A Fine Fine Boy” was released in 1963, it became Darlene Love’s ninth single to crack the Hot 100, but only the third under her own name. It never notched any higher than #53, but that was high enough to catch Bruce’s attention.

Bruce and Darlene have appeared together several times in the 21st century, but Bruce was covering her music even back in the *Born to Run* era. That’s not surprising, since Love was one of Phil Spector’s vocalists, and Bruce famously emulated Spector’s trademark “wall of sound” on his third album*.*

In the summer of 1976, almost a full year after the release of *Born to Run,* Bruce played a one-off of Darlene’s previous hit, “[He’s Sure the Boy I Love,](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/08/27/cover-me-shes-sure-the-girl-i-love/)” at the Monmouth Arts Center. A few months later in Philadelphia, he pulled out “A Fine Fine Boy,” swapped the gender of its titular character, and played it throughout his stands at the Spectrum and New York City’s Palladium.

With its rich arrangement, horn section with standout sax solo, and pre- and mid-song vamping, Bruce couldn’t have chosen a better cover to fit the E Street style. Hear for yourself: take a listen to Bruce, the E Street Band, and the Miami Horns playing a delightful cover of “A Fine Fine Girl” in Philadelphia on October 25, 1976.

Okay, so maybe Bruce couldn’t remember who sang the original on that night back in 1976, but he made it up for it years later. At the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame 25th Anniversary Concerts in 2009, Bruce and the E Street Band backed Darlene Love on that same 1963 hit they first covered almost 33 years to the day prior:

Darlene’s vocals are as rich and powerful as ever, and Bruce looks like he’s having the time of his life playing backup singer to one of the all-time greatest but unsung vocalists. And he probably was.
