He’s performed with Bruce twice before (including a wonderful <a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/06/18/kingdom-of-days-june-18/">“Wreck on the Highway” duet</a>), and Bruce hand-picked Harding to be his opening act–Bruce’s first in two decades–during his 1995 Berkeley gigs.</p>
<p>Harding has a new album out this year–brilliantly entitled <em>Greatest Other People’s Hits</em>— and it includes his wonderful cover of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/11/04/roll-of-the-dice-jackson-cage/">Jackson Cage,</a>” originally recorded and released in 1997 on the <em>One Step Up/Two Steps Back </em>tribute album. It’s also available as a bonus track on the reissue of his <em>Awake</em> album.</p>
<p>And yes, it’s worth three separate releases for a cover this good. I’ve always thought “Jackson Cage” works better as an acoustic ballad rather than an electric rocker, and Harding’s arrangement proves it: backed by guitar and a melancholy violin, Harding captures the sadness and the sense of being trapped that’s at the heart of the song without the anger of Bruce’s original version. The end result is a song that feels more resigned than frustrated, more tender than angry.</p>
<p>It’s a short list of covers that I like more than the original, but Harding’s version of “Jackson Cage” is certainly on it.</p>
