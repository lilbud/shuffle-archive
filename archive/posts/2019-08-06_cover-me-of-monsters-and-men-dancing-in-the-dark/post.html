<p>But then this one came along last week, and I am digging it too much not to share.</p>
<p>You almost certainly know Of Monsters and Men–they’ve been riding high on the alternative charts pretty much since “Little Talks,” their, um, monster debut single in 2012, and they’re about to embark on a stadium tour.</p>
<p>But who knew they counted Bruce among their influences? I didn’t, until they played this beautiful cover of “Dancing in the Dark” live at Sirius XM last month.</p>

<p>An absolutely terrific version.</p>
<p>If this makes their setlist, I might need to consider adding another concert to my autumn schedule.</p>
