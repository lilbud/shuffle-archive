I had this post originally scheduled for the end of the month, but it struck me this morning as better suited for today.

On the evening of December6 2001, Bruce kicked off his holiday concert by joining the South Community Choir of Asbury Park for an eight-minute gospel rave-up of “I’ve Got a Feeling (Everything’s Gonna Be Alright).”

It was such a spirit-lifter for a community still remembering how to celebrate so soon after a devastating tragedy that Bruce went on to perform it with them five more times over the next two years.

And while it’s been almost 17 years since he’s last performed it, today seems like a good day for a little reminder that while things sometimes take a little while to clarify, I’ve got a feeling everything’s gonna be alright.

**I’ve Got a Feeling (Everything’s Gonna Be Alright)  
First performed:** December 6, 2001 (Asbury Park, NJ)  
**Last performed:** December 8, 2003 (Asbury Park, NJ)
