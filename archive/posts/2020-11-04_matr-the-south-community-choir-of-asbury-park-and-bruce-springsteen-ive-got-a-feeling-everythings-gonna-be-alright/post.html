<p>I had this post originally scheduled for the end of the month, but it struck me this morning as better suited for today.</p>
<p>On the evening of December6 2001, Bruce kicked off his holiday concert by joining the South Community Choir of Asbury Park for an eight-minute gospel rave-up of “I’ve Got a Feeling (Everything’s Gonna Be Alright).”</p>

<p>It was such a spirit-lifter for a community still remembering how to celebrate so soon after a devastating tragedy that Bruce went on to perform it with them five more times over the next two years.</p>
<p>And while it’s been almost 17 years since he’s last performed it, today seems like a good day for a little reminder that while things sometimes take a little while to clarify, I’ve got a feeling everything’s gonna be alright.</p>
