<p>Roy Orbison’s “Leah” wasn’t intended to be a single; it was actually the B-side for his 1962 release, “Working for the Man.” But with that gorgeous, soaring melody and Orbison’s preternaturally high vocals, how could it not be?</p>
<p>“Leah” defied the odds and outperformed its A-side, peaking at #25 on the Billboard Hot 100. (“Working for the Man” made it only to #33.)</p>

<p>There may be no better showcase for Orbison’s amazing voice. But what’s perhaps even more amazing than Orbison’s original recording is his performance of it from <em>Black and White Night.</em> Recorded only a year before his death, Orbison was 51 at the time–twice the age he was when he recorded the original single. It’s nothing short of astounding how his voice held up through the years. I still get chills every time I hear him hit that first note.</p>
<p>There’s a Bruce connection, of course, although this performance stands as a must-watch regardless: Roy is backed on this night by an all-star band that includes (among others) Elvis Costello, Jackson Browne, Tom Waits,  k.d. lang, Bonnie Raitt, and Bruce Springsteen, looking on with rapt attention while he accompanies one of his musical heroes on guitar.
