(&#8220;Red Headed Woman&#8221; gets bragging rights for being performed earlier, however.)</p>\n<p>Why one song attracted prurient notice and the other didn&#8217;t, I can&#8217;t answer; why Bruce found himself compelled to write two songs featuring the act in short order&#8230; hey, the guy was a newlywed.</p>\n<p>In any event, &#8220;Cross My Heart&#8221; isn&#8217;t about cunnilingus any more than &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/05/21/roll-of-the-dice-reno/\">Reno</a>&#8221; is about butt stuff, but since the act is what attracts attention on first listen, I thought it best to address it before moving on to the main event.</p>\n<p>At any rate, Bruce drew upon more than just blue subject matter for his inspiration for this <em>Human Touch</em> deep cut&#8211;he also drew on the blues itself, borrowing his song&#8217;s title, theme, and so much of the lyrics from &#8220;Cross My Heart&#8221; by Sonny Boy Williamson II that he gave Williamson a co-writer&#8217;s credit.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Sonny Boy Williamson - Cross My Heart\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PNdfgx8Rqq4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Musically, the two songs couldn&#8217;t be more different. Williamson&#8217;s 1958 single is considered a blues classic with a stunning harmonica solo; Bruce&#8217;s song&#8230; well, compared to the other songs on <em>Human Touch</em> we can at least admire the restraint shown in the arrangement and production. (It still screams early nineties, though.)</p>\n<p>&#8220;Cross My Heart&#8221; is downright spare by\u00a0<em>Human Touch\u00a0</em>standards, with a total of four instruments: Bruce&#8217;s guitar, Roy&#8217;s keys, Randy Jackson on bass, and Toto&#8217;s Jeff Porcaro on drums. Bruce seems to be reaching for something steamy and sultry with this backing track, but he never quite gets there.\u00a0 Or maybe he overshoots, I can&#8217;t quite decide.</p>\n<p>Lyrically, though, Bruce hews pretty closely to Williamson&#8217;s line&#8211;both songs center around a protagonist desperately pleading to be forgiven for his indiscretions, promising faithfulness evermore. But whereas Williamson&#8217;s narrator seems a genuinely repentant and changed man (like the narrator of &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/11/10/roll-of-the-dice-back-in-your-arms/\">Back in Your Arms</a>&#8220;), Bruce&#8217;s protagonist seems to be a bit more self-aware.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>First time I crossed my heart I was begging baby please</em><br />\n<em>At your bedside down on my knees</em><br />\n<em>When I crossed my heart</em><br />\n<em>It&#8217;s when I crossed my heart</em><br />\n<em>I crossed my heart pretty baby over you</em></p>\n<p>The action begins with a couplet largely lifted from Williamson&#8217;s song and transformed into a devilishly clever visual double entendre. Clearly, our narrator has done something wrong and is begging his lover to take him back, but by placing his character&#8217;s act of supplication besides his lover&#8217;s bedside, Bruce suggests that his narrator&#8217;s apology is accompanied by an earthly act of contrition. In other words, he&#8217;s about to orally please his lover if only she&#8217;ll let him.</p>\n<p>Although likely employed as idiom, the narrator&#8217;s use of the sign of the cross to promise his faithfulness (from now on) is ironic given the morality tale that lies beneath &#8220;Cross My Heart.&#8221;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Second time I crossed my heart rain came in from the south</em><br />\n<em>I was lying there with something sweet and salty in my mouth</em><br />\n<em>When I crossed my heart</em><br />\n<em>It&#8217;s when I crossed my heart</em><br />\n<em>When I crossed my heart pretty darling over you</em></p>\n<p>Yeah, that means what you think it does. If the first verse was foreplay, the second is afterglow.</p>\n<p>Our narrator&#8217;s oral skills brought his lover to climax, with sweet and salty rain coming &#8220;from the south&#8221; into his mouth. Perhaps his first promise was meant to convince his lover, but this second heart-cross seems more like a promise to himself: <em>I&#8217;m not gonna screw this up again.</em></p>\n<p>Maybe.</p>\n<p>As is often the case, Bruce hides the moral of the song in the bridge&#8211;or in this case, two bridges. Here&#8217;s the first:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well you may think the world&#8217;s black and white</em><br />\n<em>And you&#8217;re dirty or you&#8217;re clean</em><br />\n<em><strong>Son</strong>, you better watch out you don&#8217;t slip</em><br />\n<em>Through them spaces in between</em></p>\n<p>Despite our narrator&#8217;s promises of fidelity, Bruce is suggesting that we are listening to someone who rationalizes his actions when he falls short. He&#8217;s <em>generally</em> good, <em>mostly </em>faithful. But the world isn&#8217;t binary, Bruce cautions, and you can find yourself going south in small increments.</p>\n<p>Significantly, the bridge is addressed not to the narrator&#8217;s lover but to the narrator himself. (Notice the &#8220;son&#8221; that&#8217;s almost under his breath.) That&#8217;s a subtle but significant detail. Combined with the sudden context switch, it suggests that we are listening to the narrator&#8217;s inner conscience talking, or perhaps even the voice of the omniscient songwriter.</p>\n<p>But before either we or our narrator can consider this further, Bruce brings us back to the heat of the moment.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Where the night gets sticky and the sky gets black</em><br />\n<em>Grabbed you baby and you grabbed me back</em><br />\n<em>And we crossed our heart</em></p>\n<p>There&#8217;s an extended instrumental break (accompanied by some vocal whooping) that implies our protagonist is getting busy and ignoring that pesky inner voice.\u00a0But then comes that second bridge&#8230;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well little boys, little girls</em><br />\n<em>Yeah they know their wrongs from their rights</em><br />\n<em>And once you cross your heart</em><br />\n<em>Well you ain&#8217;t ever supposed to lie</em></p>\n<p>That second couplet is another lift from Sonny Boy, and it&#8217;s a telling one. Our narrator may mean his promise in the moment, but he knows himself well enough to know he&#8217;s not apt to keep it forever. But he&#8217;s not going to ponder that now&#8211;he&#8217;s too content in this moment.</p>\n<p>Bruce brings it home in a final verse that lays his character&#8217;s motivation bare.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well life ain&#8217;t nothing but a cold hard ride</em><br />\n<em>I ain&#8217;t leaving &#8217;til I&#8217;m satisfied</em><br />\n<em>I cross my heart</em><br />\n<em>Yeah I cross my heart</em><br />\n<em>Well I cross my heart pretty darling over you</em></p>\n<p>There are at least a couple ways to read this, none of them charitable. When he says &#8220;I ain&#8217;t leaving &#8217;til I&#8217;m satisfied,&#8221; our narrator may be referring to his lover&#8217;s bedroom or to life in general, but either way his motivations are selfish ones. His pledge may be sincere, but its duration is suspect, and he knows it.</p>\n<p>This is a man who is easily swayed by temptation when his cold, hard ride offers an attractive detour. He lives in the moment&#8211;and for the moment, at least, he is content.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Of all the songs on\u00a0<em>Human Touch</em>, &#8220;Cross My Heart&#8221; is the song Bruce has played the least in concert. Even &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/03/01/roll-of-the-dice-cover-me-pony-boy/\">Pony Boy</a>&#8221; has had more outings.\u00a0Count yourself fortunate if you caught one of its only two performances (both in 1992), but doubly so if you caught the second instead of the first.</p>\n<p>Bruce debuted &#8220;Cross My Heart&#8221; at a homecoming show in East Rutherford on July 31, 1992, in an arrangement very close to the one on the album.</p>\n<div id=\"v-qHcQSaYj-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='568' src='https://videopress.com/embed/qHcQSaYj?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>Bruce&#8217;s second and final performance to date was the special one, however.

Bruce&#8217;s grey lyrics get a chance to breathe, and the song gains a depth (murky as it may be) that it never achieves on record.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Cross My Heart&#8221; is one of the stronger songs on\u00a0<em>Human Touch</em>, as well as its most overlooked, even by its author.
