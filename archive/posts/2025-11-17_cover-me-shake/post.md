Sam Cooke’s 1964 classic “Shake” has made many appearances in Bruce’s concerts over the years, but almost always as part of a medley. Other than a couple of bar performances, the only time he’s performed the entire song live in concert was at the tail end of the Wrecking Ball Tour in Kilkenny.

Cooke recorded “Shake” in his very last studio session in November 1964. Tragically, Cook passed away 25 days later, so he never got to see his song become a hit in early 1965.

Although arguably eclipsed over the years by its B-side, the powerful civil rights anthem “A Change Is Gonna Come,” “Shake” is still considered a landmark and influential southern soul classic, particularly due to Otis Redding’s cover shortly after Cooke’s death.

Redding’s version was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame’s , ensuring its legacy in rock and soul history.
