<p>Bruce was actually on stage for four songs that night, and “Photograph” was followed by a final encore of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/06/03/matr-ringo-starrs-all-starr-band-bruce-springsteen-and-john-candy-with-a-little-help-from-my-friends/">With a Little Help From My Friends</a>.” Bruce is on guitar only on this one, no vocals, but his contribution is easy to pick out.</p>

<p>Bruce did indeed have friends on stage that night: with the E Street Band on hiatus (not yet officially broken up), Nils and Clarence had joined up with Ringo, so it was a treat for fans to see Bruce reunite with them on stage at the Garden State Arts Center.</p>
<p>The original song, of course, was one of The Beatles’ rare singles with Ringo on lead vocals. Released in the spring of 1967 on <em>Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band</em>, the song also provided a hit single for Joe Cocker the following year.</p>
