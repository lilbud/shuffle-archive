> “You make your choices in life, and then it comes down to your heart and your resilience.” *–Patti Scialfa to Dennis Elsas, NPR, November 1, 2007*

Patti Scialfa’s third album is (in my opinion, at least) the best album to be released by *anyone* in 2007. And yes, I’m well aware that her competition included an album by her husband.

But not only is Patti at the pinnacle of her songwriting game in *Play It As It Lays,* she’s matched by the perfection of Ron Aniello’s production. This is an album that just *sounds* great (something I can’t bring myself to say about the O’Brien-produced Springsteen albums despite the strength of the songs they contain), with a core group of stellar musicians tackling some absolutely gorgeous material.

One of the best examples is the album’s title track itself. “Play It As It Lays” is a beautiful song about the reality of long-term love and partnership. The days aren’t always easy, we aren’t always at our best, and sometimes we completely let each other down. But some days are sublime, and if we trace the throughline from our beginning to our present, those good days are plentiful and persistent enough to keep us moving forward together.

Instrumentally as well, “Play It As It Lays” dazzles. Steve Jordan’s metronomic percussion sounds like the ticking of a clock, which is very much an underlying theme. And as if on cue, just as Patti makes her first dedication to taking each day with her partner as it comes, along comes Bruce on electric guitar.

Bruce makes his presence felt at just the right times: when Patti remembers laying in his arms for the first time, for example. And when Patti exits the bridge into the song’s final, confident third, Bruce buoys her voice with his B3 organ.

The way Patti and Ron deploy Bruce throughout the song is something very close to meta-commentary, and for those familiar with and appreciative of their long-term relationship, it enriches and imbues the song with real-life emotional capital.

To date, Bruce and Patti have never performed “Play It As It Lays” live, but they don’t need to–it’s perfect as is.
