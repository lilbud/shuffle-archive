<p>In November 2006, the Seeger Sessions Tour was in full swing. But on a night off in London, Bruce reminded us that he hadn’t forgotten how to rock.</p>
<p>Lucinda Williams was in town as well, and Bruce joined her on stage at her performance at Shepherds Bush Empire on November 10th for two songs. The first was a cover of Lil’ Son Jackson’s “<a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/12/04/meeting-across-the-river-lucinda-williams-and-bruce-springsteen-disgusted/">Disgusted</a>.”</p>
<p>The second, though, was Lucinda’s hard-rocking “Joy” from her 1998 breakthrough album. <em>Car Wheels on a Gravel Road</em>. And while Bruce was a backing guitarist for most of the almost thirteen-minute performance below, he gets a turn in the spotlight at around the 10:50 mark and reminds us that he’s not about to surrender his reputation as a mean rock guitarist any time soon.</p>

<p>Lucinda’s original studio version remains one of her greatest songs, a rebellious anthem for anyone who’s ever had their joy wrested from them. There isn’t much more to the lyrics than her “You took my joy; I want it back”–but if you’re looking to the lyrics to provide the song’s content, you’re listening to the wrong part.</p>
