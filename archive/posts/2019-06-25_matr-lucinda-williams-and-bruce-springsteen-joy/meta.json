The first was a cover of Lil&#8217; Son Jackson&#8217;s &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/12/04/meeting-across-the-river-lucinda-williams-and-bruce-springsteen-disgusted/\">Disgusted</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The second, though, was Lucinda&#8217;s hard-rocking &#8220;Joy&#8221; from her 1998 breakthrough album. <em>Car Wheels on a Gravel Road</em>. And while Bruce was a backing guitarist for most of the almost thirteen-minute performance below, he gets a turn in the spotlight at around the 10:50 mark and reminds us that he&#8217;s not about to surrender his reputation as a mean rock guitarist any time soon.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"&quot;Joy&quot; Lucinda Williams &amp; Bruce Springsteen - London &#039;06 (Complete)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pq02XzTGGIs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Lucinda&#8217;s original studio version remains one of her greatest songs, a rebellious anthem for anyone who&#8217;s ever had their joy wrested from them.
