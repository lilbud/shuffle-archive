In November 2006, the Seeger Sessions Tour was in full swing. But on a night off in London, Bruce reminded us that he hadn't forgotten how to rock.

Lucinda Williams was in town as well, and Bruce joined her on stage at her performance at Shepherds Bush Empire on November 10th for two songs. The first was a cover of Lil' Son Jackson's "[Disgusted](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/12/04/meeting-across-the-river-lucinda-williams-and-bruce-springsteen-disgusted/)."

The second, though, was Lucinda's hard-rocking "Joy" from her 1998 breakthrough album. *Car Wheels on a Gravel Road*. And while Bruce was a backing guitarist for most of the almost thirteen-minute performance below, he gets a turn in the spotlight at around the 10:50 mark and reminds us that he's not about to surrender his reputation as a mean rock guitarist any time soon.

Lucinda's original studio version remains one of her greatest songs, a rebellious anthem for anyone who's ever had their joy wrested from them. There isn't much more to the lyrics than her "You took my joy; I want it back"–but if you're looking to the lyrics to provide the song's content, you're listening to the wrong part.
