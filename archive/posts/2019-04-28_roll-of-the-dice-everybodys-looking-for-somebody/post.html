<p>Actually, it’s not at all clear to me that <em>anybody’s </em>looking for somebody.</p>
<p>This demo was recorded in Bruce’s home studio in Holmdel in late 1979. Fans have dubbed it “Everybody’s Looking for Somebody” (after what appears to be the refrain) or alternatively, “Blackwood” (after what appears to be a location mentioned in the song.</p>
<p>Here’s the thing, though: I’ve listened to this thing waaaay more times than a 45-second, half-bluffed demo warrants, and I’m pretty darn sure Bruce is <em>not</em> saying “everybody’s looking for somebody.”</p>
<p>Whatever everybody is looking for, it’s closer to “Blackwood” than “somebody,” but I don’t think it’s the name of a place, either.</p>
<p>To me, the first syllable in whatever everybody’s looking for sounds like “night,” which would be in keeping with Bruce’s at-the-time fascination with things that happen after dark. But I can’t be sure, and I can’t for the life of me figure out the other syllable.</p>
<p>So please give it a shot, and then you tell me. Take a listen below, and leave a comment if you think you know what Bruce is saying.</p>
