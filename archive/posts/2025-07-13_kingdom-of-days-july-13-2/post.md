***New for 2025:** New entry for 1975 and 1979*

**1974:** Bruce headlines two shows at the Bottom Line in New York City. By this time, recording sessions are underway for *Born to Run*, and Bruce has been writing prolifically. These shows feature work-in-progress versions of “Jungleland” and “Born to Run” and are fascinating to listen to.

**1975:** In a stroke of last-minute inspiration, Steven Van Zandt arranges a horn section for “[Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out.](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/11/19/roll-of-the-dice-tenth-avenue-freeze-out/)” Randy and Michael Brecker provide the wind-power, completing the song mere weeks before its official release.

**2005:** Bruce brings his Devils & Dust acoustic tour back to North America, kicking off with a show at Corel Center in Ottawa.
