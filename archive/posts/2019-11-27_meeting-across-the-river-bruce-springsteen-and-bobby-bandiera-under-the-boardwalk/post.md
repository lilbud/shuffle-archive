Can anything scream “summer at the Jersey shore” more than Bruce Springsteen singing “Under the Boardwalk?” I don’t think so.

Here’s the first time Bruce played the The Drifters’ 1964 classic, with Bobby Bandiera at The Stone Pony on June 24, 1989.

“Under the Boardwalk” is a sequel of sorts to “,” another gorgeous Drifters song that Bruce has covered a few times (but we’ll cover that another day). Here’s the original, but you almost certainly know it–the opening notes played on bass, gourd, and triangle are instantly recognizable.

Bruce covered “Under the Boardwalk” a few more times over the years. The last time was at a telethon for Hurricane Sandy relief–and it was a team-up as well, this time a bit more star-studded:
