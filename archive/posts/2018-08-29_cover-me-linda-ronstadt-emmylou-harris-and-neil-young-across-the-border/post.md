Recently, I shared a [beautiful cover](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/07/23/cover-me-willie-nelson-and-emmylou-harris-dry-lightning/) of “[Dry Lightning](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/10/16/roll-of-the-dice-dry-lightning/)” by Emmylou Harris and Willie Nelson, and almost immediately, a few friends and readers pointed me to another Emmylou duet/Bruce cover. And even though Emmylou has covered Bruce enough times to make for a mini-blog by itself, this particular track deserves more listens.

This cover of “[Across the Border](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/09/06/roll-of-the-dice-across-the-border/)” combines not just two but *three* great voices: Emmylou, Linda Ronstadt, and Neil Young (who hangs out on backing vocals but contributes a prominent harmonica).

From Linda and Emmylou’s 1999 album of duets, *Western Wall: The Tucson Sessions,* this is “Across the Border.”

It’s no wonder Bruce invited Emmylou to sing it with him at Giants Stadium in 2003.
