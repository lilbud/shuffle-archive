<p>Recently, I shared a <a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/07/23/cover-me-willie-nelson-and-emmylou-harris-dry-lightning/">beautiful cover</a> of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/10/16/roll-of-the-dice-dry-lightning/">Dry Lightning</a>” by Emmylou Harris and Willie Nelson, and almost immediately, a few friends and readers pointed me to another Emmylou duet/Bruce cover. And even though Emmylou has covered Bruce enough times to make for a mini-blog by itself, this particular track deserves more listens.</p>
<p>This cover of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/09/06/roll-of-the-dice-across-the-border/">Across the Border</a>” combines not just two but <em>three</em> great voices: Emmylou, Linda Ronstadt, and Neil Young (who hangs out on backing vocals but contributes a prominent harmonica).</p>
<p>From Linda and Emmylou’s 1999 album of duets, <em>Western Wall: The  Tucson Sessions, </em>this is “Across the Border.”</p>

<p>It’s no wonder Bruce invited Emmylou to sing it with him at Giants Stadium in 2003.</p>
