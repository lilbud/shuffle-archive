<p>In 1987, Little Steven released his third solo album, <em>Freedom–No Compromise. </em>Heavier in both content and production, the album continued the political journey he began in <em>Voice of America.</em></p>
<p><em>Freedom–No Compromise </em> also features Bruce prominently in a track called “Native American.”</p>
<p>Featuring a recurring Sioux war cry chant, “Ho Ka Hey Wah Nah” (“Let’s go now!”), “Native American” is a well-intentioned call to action for environmental protection. Steve and Bruce fully commit themselves to the song, and their sincerity <em>almost</em> carries the day.</p>
<p>Almost. Because for all its earnestness, “Native American” is lyrically and metrically awkward at times, and for me at least, that gets in the way of my appreciation of the song.</p>

<p>Despite Bruce’s participation, “Native American” was released only as a B-side (backing “Trail of Broken Treaties”) rather than as a featured single. The song never became a hit, despite getting some great exposure in Steve’s opening sets for U2 on the Joshua Tree stadium tour.</p>
<p>That didn’t stop Bruce from joining his friend and (then) ex-bandmate twice on-stage during the summer and fall of 1987, though.</p>
<p>Amazingly, both performances were captured on video. The first was at The Stone Pony in late August, where a hometown crowd gave them a raucous reception:</p>

<p>The second was at a bigger venue–The Ritz in New York City, birthplace of MTV:</p>

<p>Both performances were received generously by the audience, and come across much more naturally than on vinyl.</p>
<p>Still, Bruce hasn’t performed “Native American” with Steve in the 30+ years since.</p>
