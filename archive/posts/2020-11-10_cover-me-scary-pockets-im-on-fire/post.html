<p>It’s Double-Shot Tuesday on the Shuffle! Today, we bring you not one but <em>two</em> terrific covers of “I’m on Fire” courtesy of the fine folks at Scary Pockets.</p>
<p>Wait, wait! Don’t leave! I know we’ve spotlit a ton of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/09/11/roll-of-the-dice-im-on-fire/">I’m on Fire</a>” covers already, and truth be told the list of remaining ones could keep a blog going all by themselves.</p>
<p>But that just means the bar is high for what makes the cut to include, and both of these are well worth checking out.</p>
<p>We’ve featured the work of Scary Pockets before–they’re a Los Angeles-based covers band that funkifies classic songs with a rotating cast of guest vocalists. About a year ago, we took a look at their <a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/12/01/cover-me-scary-pockets-and-darren-criss-dancing-in-the-dark/">irresistible take</a> on “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/12/25/roll-of-the-dice-dancing-in-the-dark/">Dancing in the Dark</a>” with Darrin Criss.</p>
<p>Today, they’ve recruited <a href="https://www.rettmadison.com/">Rett Madison</a>, a new singer-songwriter on the music scene who’s already generating quite a bit of mainstream buzz in advance of her debut album. Together, Madison and Scary Pockets deliver a powerfully funky cover of “I’m on Fire” that’ll have you dancing by the one-minute mark.</p>

<p>But wait, there’s more!</p>
<p>Scary Pockets also has a sub-brand called Stories, featuring acoustic but no less inventive renditions of well-known songs. A few months back, we checked out<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/07/17/cover-me-stories-featuring-garrison-starr/"> their version</a> of Bruce’s “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/09/21/roll-of-the-dice-born-in-the-u-s-a/">Born in the U.S.A.</a>” featuring Garrison Starr.</p>
<p>That wasn’t the only time they acoustically tackled one of Bruce’s songs, though. Here’s prolific singer-songwriter <a href="https://www.georgekrikes.net/">George Krikes</a> (with three albums and five EPs under his belt between his band and solo efforts) and his moody, melodic cover of “I’m on Fire.”</p>
