Bruce and Joe Grushecky wrote this song together in 1997, although neither of them chose to record or perform it at the time.</p>\n<p>When Bruce and the E Street Band were wrapping up their Reunion Tour in June of 2000, Bruce start to premiere some brand new songs, telegraphing to fans that he wasn&#8217;t done releasing new music. First came &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/01/01/roll-of-the-dice-further-on-up-the-road/\">Further On (Up the Road)</a>&#8221; and &#8220;American Skin (41 Shots)&#8221; in Atlanta, and then at the very next show&#8211;the opening show of a ten-night closing stand at Madison Square Garden&#8211;Bruce opened the show with the debut of &#8220;Code of Silence.&#8221; (Bruce would debut one more Bruce/Joe collaboration before the tour was done.)</p>\n<div id=\"v-HOWgJ2Ki-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='426' src='https://videopress.com/embed/HOWgJ2Ki?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>The song was received by fans enthusiastically, and Bruce ended up playing it in eight shows of that final ten-night stand.</p>\n<p>Bruce brought it back for two outings on the Rising tour (one of them, unsurprisingly, in Pittsburgh, where he and Joe played the song together for the first time).\u00a0From there, &#8220;Code of Silence&#8221; has remained surprisingly obscure, showing up only at benefits or when playing or guest-starring with Grushecky.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Code of Silence&#8221; is so fierce, so strong, that you might not even realize for a few listens that there are surprisingly very few lyrics. The song is essentially a scream of frustration by a lover feeling increasingly disconnected from his partner, trying desperately to bridge the widening gulf and scale the growing wall&#8211;but ultimately, he&#8217;s just as complicit.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>There&#8217;s a code of silence that we don&#8217;t dare speak</em><br />\n<em>There&#8217;s a wall between us and a river so deep</em><br />\n<em>And we keep pretending that there&#8217;s nothing wrong</em><br />\n<em>Man, there&#8217;s a code of silence and it can&#8217;t go on</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Well, s the truth so elusive, so elusive you see</em><br />\n<em>That it ain&#8217;t enough, baby, to bridge the distance between you and me</em><br />\n<em>There&#8217;s a list of grievance a hundred miles long</em><br />\n<em>There&#8217;s a code of silence and it can&#8217;t go on</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Well you walk with your eyes open</em><br />\n<em>But your lips they remain sealed</em><br />\n<em>Beneath the promises we made are broken</em><br />\n<em>Someday the truth will be revealed</em><br />\n<em>Well I need to know now darlin&#8217;</em><br />\n<em>I need to know what&#8217;s going on</em><br />\n<em>So come on, come on, come on, come on</em><br />\n<em>Come on, come on, come on</em></p>\n<p>Nothing happens in &#8220;Code of Silence,&#8221; and nothing is resolved&#8211;the song is merely and powerfully a depiction of what it feels like to be caught and drowning in that &#8220;river so deep.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In 2006, after the song won a Grammy, Bruce and Joe finally released a studio version of &#8220;Code of Silence&#8221; &#8212; but it was on one of Joe&#8217;s albums rather than one of Bruce&#8217;s.</p>\n<p>The arrangement is identical, the vocals are clearer, and the song is just as ferocious as ever.
