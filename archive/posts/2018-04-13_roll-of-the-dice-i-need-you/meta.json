Some were released essentially as recorded on\u00a0<em>Nebraska;</em> others were electrified for\u00a0<em>Born in the U.S.A.</em>,\u00a0<em>Tracks,\u00a0</em>or other collections. And some never saw light of day at all.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I Need You&#8221; falls into that last camp. One of two work-in-progress songs based on a common melody (&#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/02/23/roll-of-the-dice-ruled-by-the-gun/\">Ruled by the Gun</a>&#8221; is the other), the existing bootleg take features lyrics that are complete enough to get a sense of what Bruce was aiming for:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>I don&#8217;t need no fancy car to drive me around</em><br />\n<em>I don&#8217;t need no pretty face cause that just gets me down</em><br />\n<em>I need you</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>I don&#8217;t need your money, baby to spend</em><br />\n<em>I don&#8217;t need your money, I don&#8217;t need your friends</em><br />\n<em>I need you</em></p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen I Need You #1\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EVyGE_UAdMs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>It&#8217;s pretty standard &#8220;that&#8217;s all right with me&#8221; romantic territory for Bruce, but there&#8217;s no real hook, which may be why he abandoned it. The only other trace of this song that we have is this backing vocal mock-up. If you can visualize them together, you might have something that could have worked on\u00a0<em>The River</em>, but we&#8217;ll probably never know. Bruce made more progress with &#8220;Ruled by the Gun,&#8221; but that&#8217;s an essay for another day.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Sprignsteen I Need You #2 background vocals\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VSV3vPoBdFM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><strong>I Need You</strong><br />\n<strong>Recorded:</strong> early 1982<br />\n<strong>Never released</strong><br />\n<strong>Never performed</strong></p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
