Some were released essentially as recorded on <em>Nebraska;</em> others were electrified for <em>Born in the U.S.A.</em>, <em>Tracks, </em>or other collections. And some never saw light of day at all.</p>
<p>“I Need You” falls into that last camp. One of two work-in-progress songs based on a common melody (“<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/02/23/roll-of-the-dice-ruled-by-the-gun/">Ruled by the Gun</a>” is the other), the existing bootleg take features lyrics that are complete enough to get a sense of what Bruce was aiming for:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I don’t need no fancy car to drive me around</em><br/>
<em>I don’t need no pretty face cause that just gets me down</em><br/>
<em>I need you</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I don’t need your money, baby to spend</em><br/>
<em>I don’t need your money, I don’t need your friends</em><br/>
<em>I need you</em></p>

<p>It’s pretty standard “that’s all right with me” romantic territory for Bruce, but there’s no real hook, which may be why he abandoned it. The only other trace of this song that we have is this backing vocal mock-up. If you can visualize them together, you might have something that could have worked on <em>The River</em>, but we’ll probably never know. Bruce made more progress with “Ruled by the Gun,” but that’s an essay for another day.</p>
