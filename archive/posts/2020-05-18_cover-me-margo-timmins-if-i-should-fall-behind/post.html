<p>The Cowboy Junkies are no strangers to covering Bruce’s music in their inimitably sad style. Their stark covers of “<a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/12/22/roll-of-the-dice-state-trooper/">State Trooper</a>” and “Thunder Road” are right up there among the best Springsteen covers out there.</p>
<p>But this one’s different.</p>
<p>Margo Timmins’ solo turn on “<a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/06/01/roll-of-the-dice-if-i-should-fall-behind/">If I Should Fall Behind</a>” is delicate, sweet, and so intimate you can hear the piano pedals.</p>

<p>Featuring Margo on lead vocals, Nick Craine on backgrounds (himself no stranger to Bruce’s music), and Witold Grabowiecki on piano, and Jeff Bird on bass, this darn-near perfect cover stems from Margo’s 2009 under-the-radar <em>Margo’s Corner </em>recordings.</p>
<p>It’s one of my favorite performances of one of Bruce’s best songs.</p>
