**1974:** Bruce and the E Street Band play their first of two nights at Philadelphia's Tower Theater in Upper Darby. Bruce opens with a beautiful "[Incident on 57th Street](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/12/14/roll-of-the-dice-incident-on-57th-street/)" played with only Roy and Suki accompanying. Other highlights include an early "Born to Run," the gorgeous "[Spanish Harlem](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/01/23/cover-me-spanish-harlem/)" and electric "[It's Hard to Be a Saint in the City](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/10/21/roll-of-the-dice-its-hard-to-be-a-saint-in-the-city/)," the latter of which features the first appearance of the police siren sound effect the band will use for the next few months (most notably during "Incident on 57th Street" at the famous 1975 Main Point show).
