<p>Thanks to Jason Luttrull for bringing this one to my attention!</p>
<p>I’m a big fan of Mojo Nixon’s cover of “<a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/11/11/roll-of-the-dice-the-big-payback/">The Big Payback</a>” from his first album with Skid Roper, and I’ve long wished he’d take a run at another song from Bruce’s catalog.</p>
<p>Little did I know he’d already done so back in 1997–sort of.</p>
<p>Turns out that while rehearsing for his <em>Sock Ray Blue</em> album in the studio, his rehearsal sessions included a rough cut of “<a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/05/20/roll-of-the-dice-badlands/">Badlands</a>,” The song never made it on the album, but it’s a bold, fresh (but still just as fierce) arrangement that deserves to be heard. Take a listen:</p>
