<p><strong>1969: </strong>Child plays a gig at the Student Prince in Asbury Park.</p>
<p><strong>1975: </strong>On Night Three of Bruce’s legendary stand at New York City’s Bottom Line, the early show is broadcast live on WNEW-FM, resulting in one of Bruce’s most widely bootlegged shows ever. Listen to that historic broadcast below.</p>

<p>There’s no audio from the late show, and that’s too bad: it features the last known performance of “New York City Serenade” for 24 years.</p>
<p><strong>1977: </strong>Bruce holds a recording session for his upcoming album at Atlantic Studios in New York City.</p>
<p><strong>1978: </strong>Bruce and the E Street Band deliver a scorching performance at Washington DC’s Capital Center (actually in Largo, Maryland)–and we know just how good it was because we can see for ourselves: this show is captured in stunning quality (for the time). Watch below to see the E Street Band at the height of their powers.</p>

<p><strong>2012: </strong>Night Two at Boston’s Fenway Park brings an embarrassment of riches, from an opening “Thunder Road” with just Bruce and Roy, to an almost completely audibled opening pack, to the first “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/04/02/cover-me-knock-on-wood/">Knock on Wood</a>” in 36 years, to the first “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/10/24/roll-of-the-dice-prove-it-all-night/">Prove It ’78</a>” in the U.S.A. since ’78, a guest-spot by Ken Casey, and so much more.
