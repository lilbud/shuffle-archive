Bruce hid it on the unimaginatively named <em>18 Tracks</em>, which most casual fans assume is just an abridged version of his larger\u00a0<em>Tracks\u00a0</em>box set but which actually contains three tracks unique to that disc. &#8220;Trouble River&#8221; is one of those three.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a taut little number that features a terrific extended guitar solo from Bruce that comprises a full third of the song&#8211;in fact it&#8217;s the standout feature of the track, which also features a three-man backing band of Roy Bittan, Jeff Pocaro, and Rany Jackson (yes, <em>that</em> Randy Jackson).</p>\n<p>Take a listen:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Trouble River (Studio Outtake - 1990)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0KstWZbn3Fw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>In typical Springsteen fashion, it&#8217;s easy to get caught up in the riff and the hook and miss the fact that lyrically, the song is about dread&#8211;creeping, paralyzing dread.</p>\n<p>But once you really listen to the lyrics, there&#8217;s no mistaking it&#8211;especially because there are only eight lines in the entire song. (I did say it was taut, didn&#8217;t I?)</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>There&#8217;s a river runs through this valley, cold and deep and black</em><br />\n<em>Coming like a tombstone shadow across my back</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Woke up last night shaking, shaking from a dream</em><br />\n<em>All I seen was smiling faces staring back at me</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Snakes crawling in the house, I&#8217;m stuck in muddy ground</em><br />\n<em>Tonight I&#8217;m gonna shed this skin &#8217;cause water&#8217;s rising and I&#8217;m going down to</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Trouble river, six foot high and rising</em><br />\n<em>Trouble river, I can&#8217;t keep from crying</em></p>\n<p>With a song this concise, Bruce doesn&#8217;t leave us a lot to dissect, but there are a few things worth noting:</p>\n<p>First, the notion of shedding one&#8217;s skin is a metaphor that Bruce would use again the following year in &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/03/18/roll-of-the-dice-living-proof/\">Living Proof</a>.&#8221; Although we must be careful not to assume that every song Bruce writes is autobiographical, much of the material that stems from his 1990-1991 songwriting is rooted in deeply personal experience. Given that he had recently relocated to the west coast, separated from his band and started a family, it may be a fair assumption that Bruce was very much focused on reinventing himself, renewing himself, like a snake shedding its skin.</p>\n<p>Next, it&#8217;s also hard to listen to this song with the benefit of hindsight and the context of Bruce&#8217;s depression disclosure and wonder if &#8220;Trouble River&#8221; was at least in part an exercise in expressing in song what he&#8217;d been grappling with in life. Dread and depression are not the same thing, to be sure, but the notion of having a dark shadow cast upon you, the feeling of being stuck and mired and gloomy while those around you are smiling, and those last words&#8211;&#8220;I can&#8217;t keep from crying&#8221;&#8211;those all sound as applicable to depression as to dread.</p>\n<p>Lastly, the &#8220;yeeeaaaaahhhhh-hoo!&#8221; Performance-wise, it&#8217;s all about the guitar solo and the yeah-hoo. If Bruce was indeed trying to exorcise some demons, he sure gave it his all vocally.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s some irony in that fact that Bruce plays with such gleeful abandon on a song so dark. He did that the one time he played it live, as well.</p>\n<p>On August 1, 1999, early in the U.S. leg of the Reunion Tour, Bruce broke out &#8220;Trouble River&#8221; for its one and only performance&#8211;ever&#8211;and probably puzzled most of his casual fans in the process. (Who would have thought &#8220;Trouble River&#8221; would be one of the first\u00a0<em>Human Touch-</em>era songs Bruce would play with the E Street Band?)</p>\n<p>The band seems a bit nonplussed, too. Watch the video below (and yes, it&#8217;s remarkable that we have a fan-shot video of the one and only time this song was played a full two decades ago), and you&#8217;ll see that while Bruce is having a good time, the band members don&#8217;t seem to be quite as into it.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Trouble River Bruce Springsteen 1999 NJ\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-TYKWXeXf9A?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Whatever the reason, the song didn&#8217;t seem to translate well to the E Street stage, and perhaps that&#8217;s why we haven&#8217;t seen it since. That&#8217;s too bad&#8211;while I certainly wouldn&#8217;t rank it amongst Bruce&#8217;s best work, the successful recent outings for the musically similar &#8220;Seven Angels&#8221; and &#8220;All or Nothin&#8217; at All&#8221; suggest that there&#8217;s a place for a song like &#8220;Trouble River&#8221; in Bruce&#8217;s sets.</p>\n<p><strong>Trouble River<br />\nRecorded:</strong> April 6, 1990<br />\n<strong>Released:</strong> <em>18 Tracks</em> (1999)<br />\n<strong>First performed:</strong> August 1, 1999 (East Rutherford, NJ)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> August 1, 1999 (East Rutherford, NJ)</p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
