It’s Double-Shot Tuesday on the Shuffle! Today, we bring you not one but terrific covers of “I’m on Fire” courtesy of the fine folks at Scary Pockets.

*two*

Wait, wait! Don’t leave! I know we’ve spotlit a ton of “” covers already, and truth be told the list of remaining ones could keep a blog going all by themselves.

But that just means the bar is high for what makes the cut to include, and both of these are well worth checking out.

We’ve featured the work of Scary Pockets before–they’re a Los Angeles-based covers band that funkifies classic songs with a rotating cast of guest vocalists. About a year ago, we took a look at their on “” with Darrin Criss.

Today, they’ve recruited , a new singer-songwriter on the music scene who’s already generating quite a bit of mainstream buzz in advance of her debut album. Together, Madison and Scary Pockets deliver a powerfully funky cover of “I’m on Fire” that’ll have you dancing by the one-minute mark.

But wait, there’s more!

Scary Pockets also has a sub-brand called Stories, featuring acoustic but no less inventive renditions of well-known songs. A few months back, we checked out of Bruce’s “” featuring Garrison Starr.

That wasn’t the only time they acoustically tackled one of Bruce’s songs, though. Here’s prolific singer-songwriter (with three albums and five EPs under his belt between his band and solo efforts) and his moody, melodic cover of “I’m on Fire.”
