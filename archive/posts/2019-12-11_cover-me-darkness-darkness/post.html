Even though the band released it as a single twice (once in 1969 and then again the following year), it took the second attempt for it to even crack the Top 100.</p>

<p>That didn’t stop Jesse Colin Young’s anti-war song from inspiring a host of covers over the years from Robert Plant, Ann and Nancy Wilson, Eric Burdon, Cowboy Junkies, and more.</p>
<p>It also influenced a very young Bruce Springsteen, who added the song to his set lists for several shows during his pre-label Bruce Springsteen Band era.</p>
<p>It’s not surprising that “Darkness, Darkness” resonated with Bruce. With lyrics describing the nighttime terrors of a soldier in Vietnam, the song must have hit close to home for Bruce, who had already lost a bandmate and a local hero to the war.</p>
<p>But it’s a little bit surprising that Bruce chose to arrange “Darkness, Darkness” as a twelve-minute instrumental jam rather than include its lyrics.</p>

<p>Why’d he do that? Beats me, but the Bruce Springsteen Band still manages to communicate the narrator’s dread and horror even without the lyrics.</p>
<p>Even then, they were that good.</p>
