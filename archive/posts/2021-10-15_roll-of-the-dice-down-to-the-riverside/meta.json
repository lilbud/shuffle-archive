But it&#8217;s worth a little backstory first.</p>\n<p>In the early days of 1972, Bruce Springsteen was thinking about his family.</p>\n<p>I mean, he was thinking about them a\u00a0<em>lot</em>.</p>\n<p>He&#8217;d just returned from an extended holiday visit to his parents&#8217; house in San Mateo. California, a visit that was supposed to have been permanent (he even earned his first driver&#8217;s license while he was there) but ended up lasting only about a month.</p>\n<p>He&#8217;d been driven west by heartbreak, leaving behind his band and a toxic romance. Looking to start over in a new place, he started by renewing his oldest relationships. Although his relations with his parents had been strained when he was a teen, Bruce was a mature 22 now. Whatever ice had formed over the years thawed during their reunion.</p>\n<p>Bruce may have successfully burnished his familial bonds, but he was far less successful finding a way to make living out west. Ultimately, he returned to where &#8220;I was who I was, a son of New Jersey, gunslinger, bar band king, small-town local hero, big fish in a little pond and breadwinner.&#8221;\u00a0As we saw a few days ago when we looked at &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/10/11/cover-me-confessin-the-blues/\">Confessin&#8217; the Blues</a>,&#8221; Bruce went back home in January, resumed his position as leader of the band named after him, and picked up where he left off.</p>\n<p>But something had changed.</p>\n<p>Bruce may have left his family behind geographically, but emotionally they were still very much with him.</p>\n<p>In those first few months following his return to New Jersey in 1972, he recorded &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/02/23/roll-of-the-dice-family-song/\">Family Song</a>,&#8221; a chronicle of his reunion with and newfound empathy for his parents.</p>\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t just his parents on his mind, though, because &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/12/27/roll-of-the-dice-randolph-street/\">Randolph Street</a>&#8221; also came out of this period. &#8220;Randolph Street&#8221; was a love letter to his grandparents and a tentative attempt to revisit his great loss when they passed away.</p>\n<p>But Bruce never directly faces death head-on in &#8220;Randolph Street.&#8221; His sixteen-year-old self is the narrator, in a detached state of shock on the day of his grandmother&#8217;s passing. We hear Bruce recollect his grandparents in loving detail, and we can hear the pain in his voice as he revisits their final days. But when it comes to his grandparents&#8217; deaths, his songwriting is delicate and circumspect.</p>\n<p>Maybe that&#8217;s because he saved it all up for a third song born in that period.</p>\n<p>Today we complete Bruce&#8217;s early trilogy by listening to &#8220;Down to the Riverside,&#8221; which has never before been publicly available in any form.</p>\n<p>Unlike &#8220;Family Song&#8221; and &#8220;Randolph Street,&#8221; Bruce doesn&#8217;t seem to have ever recorded &#8220;Down to the Riverside&#8221; in the studio. But he performed it with the Bruce Springsteen Band on February 25, 1972 during their Richmond residency, and that show was captured in stunning soundboard quality by Richmond&#8217;s Stillwater Studios.</p>\n<p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-attachment-id=\"30292\" data-permalink=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/10/15/roll-of-the-dice-down-to-the-riverside/setlist-2/#main\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/setlist.jpg?fit=562%2C566&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"562,566\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"setlist\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/setlist.jpg?fit=298%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/setlist.jpg?fit=562%2C566&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-30292\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/setlist.jpg?resize=758%2C764&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"758\" height=\"764\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/setlist.jpg?resize=298%2C300&amp;ssl=1 298w, https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/setlist.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/setlist.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/setlist.jpg?w=562&amp;ssl=1 562w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 758px) 100vw, 758px\" /></p>\n<p>The recording never escaped into the wild, however.\u00a0Instead, it was given to John Hammond, and it remained in his private collection until it was <a href=\"https://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2014/rock-roll-history-presley-to-punk-n09160/lot.136.html\">auctioned by Sotheby&#8217;s</a> to a private collector in June 2014.</p>\n<p>On the set list (handwritten, but not by Bruce) that accompanies the tape, the song is listed as &#8220;When Grandpa Died,&#8221; but the song title &#8220;Down to the Riverside&#8221; had surfaced a few years earlier in an auction of one of Bruce&#8217;s handwritten setlists from the Bruce Springsteen Band era.

He needn&#8217;t have worried.&#8221;</p>\n<p>True that.</p>\n<p>Okay, that&#8217;s enough backstory. It&#8217;s time for that rarest of pleasures: a first listen to a Bruce Springsteen song (even if that song is fifty years old).</p>\n<p>Now, I will admit that I am biased. If you are one of my regular readers, you know of my particular fondness for the Bruce Springsteen Band. They were basically a prototypical E Street Band; only Clarence and Danny had yet to join. The band&#8217;s sound was bluesy, jazzy, and (when the paycheck was\u00a0 big enough that they could afford a horn section) sometimes bright and brassy.</p>\n<p>Most of the Bruce Springsteen Band&#8217;s repertoire was uptempo. Much of it was lyrically light, even bordering on pop. &#8220;Down to the Riverside,&#8221; however, is a notable exception, a slow-motion retelling of Frederick Springsteen&#8217;s dying day, a contemplative reminiscence in a delta blues mold.</p>\n<p>The band plays with restraint from the ruminating, lost-in-thought introduction through most of the song, but that doesn&#8217;t mean the performance is anything less than powerful. We hear fine guitar interplay between Bruce and Steve throughout, and there&#8217;s an emotional undercurrent that simmers, simmers, simmers&#8230; until Bruce finally lets his grief wash over him via an emotional guitar solo and plaintive harp solo. And for a Mad Dog, Vini Lopez plays with remarkable sensitivity and empathy, matching Bruce&#8217;s shifting moods and building power throughout.</p>\n<p>As for the lyrics, they speak for themselves. Other than the title phrase, there&#8217;s not a trace of metaphor and none of the wordplay that would characterize most of his songwriting that year. The power of Bruce&#8217;s lyrics is in their plainness.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s time. If you have headphones, put them on so you can best experience the clarity and warmth of this half-century-old recording. Let&#8217;s take a listen to The Bruce Springsteen Band performing &#8220;Down to the Riverside.&#8221;</p>\n<!--[if lt IE 9]><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\">document.createElement('audio');</script><![endif]-->\n<audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-30275-1\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/06-Down-to-the-Riverside.mp3?_=1\" /><a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/06-Down-to-the-Riverside.mp3\">https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/06-Down-to-the-Riverside.mp3</a></audio>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve read\u00a0<em>Born to Run\u00a0</em>or heard Bruce speak of losing his grandparents, you already knew the story.
