<p>Surprisingly, though, they never played together on stage until 1992, when Bruce’s World Tour took him to Paris, where Elliott was now living. They only played one song that night (Elliot’s “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/08/24/matr-elliot-murphy-and-bruce-springsteen-rock-ballad/">Rock Ballad</a>“), but that was all it took to set a precedent, and from that point forward whenever Bruce was in Paris for a gig, you’d likely find Murphy on stage with him at some point during the show.</p>
<p>Murphy  joined Bruce on stage in Paris nine more times over the next 25 years, starting with an encore appearance during Bruce’s solo acoustic show on May 26, 1997.</p>
<p>Like they did five years earlier, they played one of Elliott’s songs–this time “Diamonds by the Yard,” the opening track of his 1976 album, <em>Night Lights</em>.</p>

<p>“Diamonds by the Yard” was Elliott’s first “epic” song; at nearly seven minutes, it’s practically Springsteenian in length and grandeur. It was a natural pick for them to play together that night in Paris.</p>

<p>With only two acoustic guitars between them, it wasn’t quite as majestic an arrangement as on the album, but it was a delightful surprise and lovely performance nonetheless and remains the only time Bruce has ever performed Elliott’s song.</p>
