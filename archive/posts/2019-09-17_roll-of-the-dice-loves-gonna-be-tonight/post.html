<p>For all of the incredible songs that came out of Bruce’s prolific songwriting for <em>The River</em>, there were a lot that never went anywhere–including a trifle called “Love’s Gonna Be Tonight.”</p>
<p>As far as we know, “Love’s Gonna Be Tonight” never made it passed the home demo stage, and even those recordings were little more than attempts by Bruce to get his Buddy Holly on.</p>
<p>There’s definitely an infectious “Peggy Sue” vibe to this one in both the melody and lyrics (the few that aren’t bluffed, that is). Take a listen and hear for yourself.</p>

<p>It would have been interesting to hear this one develop; I think it might have been right at home on <em>The River</em> alongside “<a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/05/28/roll-of-the-dice-two-hearts/">Two Hearts</a>,” especially in this second attempt, in which we can clearly hear Bruce envisioning what the song would sound like electrified:</p>

<p>But unfortunately, these two <em>very</em> rough and early takes are the only insight we have in to what could have grown into a terrific song if Bruce had only pursued it.</p>
