<p>I’m not the biggest Cher fan, and the whole “bar in the sky” thing is a bit over-the-top and more than a bit corny, but… I do like her vocal turn on “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/08/08/roll-of-the-dice-tougher-than-the-rest/">Tougher Than the Rest</a>” from her 1990 performance in Vegas.</p>
<p>Also: Darlene Love! She classes up any act.</p>
