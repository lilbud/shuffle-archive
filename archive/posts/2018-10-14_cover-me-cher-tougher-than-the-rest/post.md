I’m not the biggest Cher fan, and the whole “bar in the sky” thing is a bit over-the-top and more than a bit corny, but… I do like her vocal turn on “[Tougher Than the Rest](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/08/08/roll-of-the-dice-tougher-than-the-rest/)” from her 1990 performance in Vegas.

Also: Darlene Love! She classes up any act.
