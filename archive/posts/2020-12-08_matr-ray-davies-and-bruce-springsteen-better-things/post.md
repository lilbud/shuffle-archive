“Better Things” was something of a comeback single for The Kinks when they released it in 1981; it placed them back on the charts in the US and the UK after being absent for more than a decade. Never reaching past the #92 spot on the Hot 100, it still provided the venerable band a foothold they very much needed.

Their follow-up single “Destroyer” would notch slightly higher, but their next single “Come Dancing” would go all the way to #6, tying “Tired of Waiting for You” as their most successful single. “Better Things” made it all possible.

Almost thirty years later, Ray Davies joined Metallica on stage at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame 25th Anniversary Concerts, playing two of his classic Kinks songs with the legendary metal band. Davies enjoyed it so much, he started speculating on the spot about doing an album of similar collaborations. He mentioned it to Bruce (also performing at the event), who accepted on the spot.

And that’s how Ray Davies’ 2010 album came to kick off with “Better Things” as its leadoff track, a duet between Ray and Bruce.

To date, Bruce has never played “Better Things” in concert, but thankfully we have this terrific studio recording as a trade-off.
