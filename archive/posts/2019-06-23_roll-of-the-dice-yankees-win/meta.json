At Fenway, Bruce publicly proclaimed that he had broken the curse that had always kept the Red Sox at arm&#8217;s length from a world series title&#8211;and lo and behold, the following year, the Red Sox won their first, adding another entry to the\u00a0<em>Legends of Springsteen</em> annals.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>It&#8217;s the end of the last tour, E Street Band looking for a place to play</em><br />\n<em>We went to Yankee Stadium, but the boss man turned us away</em><br />\n<em>We went up north to Fenway and those kind folks let us in</em><br />\n<em>Oh, lord, Yankees lose</em></p>\n<p>But in the end, everyone knew that Bruce would bring it back around to acknowledge Torre&#8217;s contributions to baseball and to his community.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well, Joe, we wish you plenty of luck and good fortune, and</em><br />\n<em>We don&#8217;t know when we&#8217;ll be seeing the likes of you again</em><br />\n<em>You could teach a master class in class, and so, my good friend</em><br />\n<em>Thanks for all those thrills and chills and all those Yankee wins</em></p>\n<p>It was a touching way for Bruce to honor the man who&#8217;d brought him (and so many other Yankees fans) joy and pride.</p>\n<p><strong>Yankees Win</strong><br />\n<strong>Never recorded</strong><br />\n<strong>Never released</strong><br />\n<strong>First performed:</strong> November 7, 2007<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> November 7, 2007</p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
