Molly Healey is a multi-talented looping violinist, cellist, and guitarist, and she puts two of those talents (along with a terrific voice) to use on her cover of Bruce Springsteen’s “.”

I know that “Dancing in the Dark” covers are a dime a dozen these days, but trust me: you haven’t seen or heard one like Molly’s before.

Make sure you watch all the way through–the final three minutes are a stunning example of what Molly calls “rock-inspired orchestral looping.”
