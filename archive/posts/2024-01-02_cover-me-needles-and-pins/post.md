Written by Sonny Bono and Jack Nitzsche, “Needles and Pins” was first recorded in 1963 by Jackie DeShannon, who scored a minor hit with it, peaking at #84 in the U.S. (but taking it all the way to the top in Canada.)

But it was most likely The Searchers’ version the following year that brought the song to Bruce’s attention. Their cover was an international hit, reaching #13 in the U.S. but cracking the top ten in Germany, Sweden, and Norway and reaching the top spot in the U.K, Ireland, and South Africa.

Regardless of whose version captured Bruce’s imagination, he was definitely taken with the song. Over the course of the Born to Run Tour, Bruce soundchecked “Needles and Pins” three different times that we know of–in February, July, and December.

Given how rare it is for us to have a setlist (much less a recording) of a soundcheck from that era, it’s likely that Bruce rehearsed it regularly throughout 1975.

Why didn’t he actually play it during a show? I have no idea. But we’re fortunate to at least have one recording (albeit a muffled one) of Bruce playing this early rock classic. Take a listen to Bruce playing “Needles and Pins” at his soundcheck in Geneva, New York, on July 22, 1975.

here’s a clearer recording from a soundcheck earlier in the year: February 23rd at the Westbury Music Fair. Unfortunately, we only have thirty seconds of it, but it’s a nice listen anyway.
