Their cover was an international hit, reaching #13 in the U.S. but cracking the top ten in Germany, Sweden, and Norway and reaching the top spot in the U.K, Ireland, and South Africa.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"The Searchers &quot;Needles And Pins&quot; on The Ed Sullivan Show\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ugDXpdjmpgw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Regardless of whose version captured Bruce&#8217;s imagination, he was definitely taken with the song. Over the course of the Born to Run Tour, Bruce soundchecked &#8220;Needles and Pins&#8221; three different times that we know of&#8211;in February, July, and December.</p>\n<p>Given how rare it is for us to have a setlist (much less a recording) of a soundcheck from that era, it&#8217;s likely that Bruce rehearsed it regularly throughout 1975.</p>\n<p>Why didn&#8217;t he actually play it during a show? I have no idea. But we&#8217;re fortunate to at least have one recording (albeit a muffled one) of Bruce playing this early rock classic. Take a listen to Bruce playing &#8220;Needles and Pins&#8221; at his soundcheck in Geneva, New York, on July 22, 1975.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - &quot;Needles and Pins&quot; - Soundcheck in Geneva , 1975-07-22\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zaANhuBBSzc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> here&#8217;s a clearer recording from a soundcheck earlier in the year: February 23rd at the Westbury Music Fair.
