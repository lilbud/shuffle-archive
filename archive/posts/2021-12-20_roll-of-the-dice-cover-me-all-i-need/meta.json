With a classic R&amp;B backing track, passionate (albeit bluffed) vocals, and an arrangement right smack in the E Street sweet spot, &#8220;All I Need&#8221;\u00a0<em>needed</em> to be finished and released.</p>\n<p>And it was&#8230; sort of.</p>\n<p>By the end of the summer of 1981, Bruce would be in full <em>Nebraska </em>song-writing mode, but that didn&#8217;t stop him from recording &#8220;All I Need&#8221; with the E Street Band at the Hit Factory in New York City in early 1982.</p>\n<p>But a recording doesn&#8217;t guarantee a release, as Springsteen fans well know. Bruce had moved on to a new, sparer sound for his next album release, and more mature, less retro songs for his next band album after that.</p>\n<p>So Bruce took &#8220;All I Need&#8221; and six other original songs in the same vein and donated them to Gary U.S. Bonds for Bonds&#8217; next album,\u00a0<em>On the Line</em>.</p>\n<p>Bruce and Steve Van Zandt had produced Bonds&#8217; &#8220;comeback&#8221; album, <em>Dedication</em>, in 1981, and they reprised their co-producer roles for\u00a0<em>On the Line\u00a0</em>as well. Between the two albums, Bruce donated an amazingly generous <em>ten</em> songs to Bonds, a number of which could have been hits for Bruce (including, of course, &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/09/06/rotd-matr-cover-me-gary-u-s-bonds-bruce-springsteen-the-e-street-band-this-little-girl/\">This Little Girl</a>&#8221; which Bonds scored with in 1981).</p>\n<p>But of all the songs Bruce gave away for\u00a0<em>On the Line</em> that cried out for an official Springsteen release, &#8220;All I Need&#8221; ranks near the top. Such a recording almost certainly exists, and it very probably uses the exact same E Street Band backing track that Bonds recorded his vocals over.\u00a0 Let&#8217;s take a listen:</p>\n<div id=\"v-HbdN8Y0e-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='426' src='https://videopress.com/embed/HbdN8Y0e?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>Bruce still sticks pretty close to that &#8220;It&#8217;s Gonna Work Out Fine&#8221; melody, but it&#8217;s lusher now, more romantic and soulful, with a coda at least inspired by if not lifted from &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/04/10/roll-of-the-dice-darkness-on-the-edge-of-town/\">Darkness on the Edge of Town</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The lyrics speak for themselves&#8211;not much is required in the way of analysis. This is a pure R&amp;B pop song., with Bruce&#8217;s narrator finding all the validation he needs in the love of his girl.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Some men need riches and lots of money to spend</em><br />\n<em>Some men need power to hold over other men</em><br />\n<em>But not me, baby, girl you can believe</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;m telling you my darling</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>You&#8217;re all I need in this world, girl</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Some men need fine clothes, big diamond rings</em><br />\n<em>To feel like somebody some men need expensive things</em><br />\n<em>But I feel like somebody, girl, every time you look at me</em><br />\n<em>I don&#8217;t need nothing to remind me that</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>You&#8217;re all I need in this world, girl</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>And it&#8217;s hard to keep holding on</em><br />\n<em>When you put your arms around me, I feel strong</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Some men need a fine home on a far hillside</em><br />\n<em>Some men need a big car to show off as they ride</em><br />\n<em>Some men need a pretty woman just to walk by their side</em><br />\n<em>And some men need to see the fear in another man&#8217;s eyes</em><br />\n<em>But all I need baby, is all I can see</em><br />\n<em>When you wrap your loving arms around me</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>You&#8217;re all I need in this world, girl</em></p>\n<p>&#8220;All I Need&#8221; is such confection perfection that we&#8217;ll set aside its irony: a protagonist who pooh-poohs men who require external validation for internal confidence and security, but who ultimately owns up to the very same thing.
