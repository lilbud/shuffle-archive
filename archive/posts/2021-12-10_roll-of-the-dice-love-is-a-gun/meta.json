Bruce often writes his music before his lyrics, and this appears to be one of those times. &#8220;Love Is a Gun&#8221; is a complete musical piece, but good luck trying to make out any intelligible lyrics until you get to the end&#8230;. and even then, he&#8217;s mostly bluffing.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen Love is a Gun #2\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bdq3UbGrrog?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>I&#8217;m not even sure Bruce is singing\u00a0<em>love is a gun,\u00a0</em>to be honest.
