<p>On May 3, 2009, the music world paid tribute to Pete Seeger on the occasion of his 90th birthday.</p>
<p>Bruce Springsteen performed that night, as did John Mellencamp, Tom Morello, Michael Franti, Emmylou Harris, Dave Matthews, Joan Baez, and many more.</p>
<p>Pete performed at his own party, too. At the end of the night he joined Bruce, Patti, and an all-star ensemble (including Pete’s grandson Tao) for a rousing rendition of Pete’s “Well May the World Go.”</p>
<p>Bruce and Patti stayed respectfully in the background, but they were clearly excited to be part of the festivities.</p>

<p>“Well May the World Go” was a great choice to cap an evening celebrating the life of Pete Seeger. Written by Pete in 1973 (adapted from the 18th century song “Weel May the Keel Row”), the song is a wish for peace, health, joy, and love for the world long after the singer is gone from it.</p>

<p>Pete spent his life doing his best to ensure that well the world may go, and he’d go on to do so for almost another five years after his 90th birthday concert.</p>
<p>Pete passed from this earth in early 2014, but his music and his benediction live on.</p>
