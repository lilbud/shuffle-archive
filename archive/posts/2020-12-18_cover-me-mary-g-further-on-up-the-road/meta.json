In the process, they often lose the connection to the original that led the first cover artist to re-arrange it to begin with.</p>\n<p>But there are some covers that are so definitive and so distinctive that they deservedly spawn covers of their own.</p>\n<p>Johnny Cash&#8217;s superb version of Bruce&#8217;s &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/01/01/roll-of-the-dice-further-on-up-the-road/\">Further On (Up the Road)</a>&#8221; is one such cover.
