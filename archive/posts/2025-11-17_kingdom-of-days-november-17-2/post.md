**1973:** Bruce and the E Street Band headline two shows at the Roxy Theater in Roxborough, the latter of which features the first known recording of Bruce covering “[634-5789 (Soulsville, U.S.A.](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/08/14/cover-me-634-5789-soulsville-u-s-a/)“)

**1978:** Bruce and the boys play a Darkness show at the Munn Ice Arena at Michigan State University in East Lansing, and at least one reviewer is not impressed. Watch rare video from this show below, but note that the footage was recorded silently–the dubbed audio is from a different show.

**1987:** Bruce and director Meiert Avis film the video for “[Tunnel of Love](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/06/15/roll-of-the-dice-tunnel-of-love/)” in and around Asbury Park. You’ve seen the final result, no doubt, but have you seen this original rough cut? It features a lot more footage of Bruce.

**1990:** Bruce plays the second of his remarkable pair of acoustic shows to benefit the Christic Institute. Tonight sees the world debuts of “[The Wish](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/06/23/roll-of-the-dice-the-wish/),” and “[Soul Driver.](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2023/01/22/roll-of-the-dice-soul-driver/)” The arrangement of “[Real World](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/07/25/roll-of-the-dice-real-world/)” played these two nights is far superior (IMO) to the version that will be released two years down the road, and when Bruce resurrects the song in 2005, he will return to this arrangement.

**1992:** Just like in the old days, several minutes after Bruce leaves the stage following his World Tour 1992 show in Chapel Hill, he stuns remaining fans (and the band and crew) by returning to the stage to play an extra encore of “[Working on the Highway](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/01/11/roll-of-the-dice-working-on-the-highway/),” muttering “All I was gonna do is sit in the hotel room anyway…”
