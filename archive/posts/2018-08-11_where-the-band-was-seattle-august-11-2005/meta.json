It had been three years since I&#8217;d seen a show in the Seattle area, and I was used to travelling and meeting new people in the interim. So it was kind of a novelty to go to a show joined by a bunch of friends and co-workers&#8211;I even convinced my wife to join me for this one, which is a pretty rare thing.</p>\n<p>Portland&#8217;s setlist was romantic and eclectic, and I suspected that Seattle might turn out to be a very different show. I was right: Seattle was no less surprising, and still filled with rarities (including five songs I&#8217;d never heard live before), but the mood was more serious&#8211;this was Bruce in cinematic mode, with liberal dips into\u00a0<em>Nebraska\u00a0</em>and <a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2023/06/03/album-companion-the-ghost-of-tom-joad/\"><em>The Ghost of Tom Joad</em></a>-style storytelling.</p>\n<p>Bruce had been on a streak, opening shows with a tour debut&#8211;heck, sometimes even a world debut&#8211;each night, but he broke pattern in Seattle, opening with a song he&#8217;d played before (&#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/03/18/roll-of-the-dice-living-proof/\">Living Proof</a>&#8220;) but in a very different arrangement&#8211;on pump organ instead of guitar. Either way, it was a first for me, and I savored the moment, knowing that another night of unpredictable, personal firsts was in store.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Living Proof - Seattle - 8/11/05\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DOr0YpxkVtI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>The next two songs were predictable&#8211;Bruce always followed the wild card opener with a haunting bullet mic arrangement of &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/02/27/roll-of-the-dice-reason-to-believe/\">Reason to Believe</a>&#8221; and his new album&#8217;s title track, &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/03/02/roll-of-the-dice-devils-dust/\">Devils &amp; Dust</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Reason To Believe - Seattle - 8/11/05\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tFIBClwkUz0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Devils And Dust - Seattle - 8/11/05\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mw6wYYX50yo?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8230;but what followed next was a genuine surprise: a Tom Joad throwback and a personal first: &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/03/23/roll-of-the-dice-highway-29/\">Highway 29</a>,&#8221; one of my favorite songs from that album.
