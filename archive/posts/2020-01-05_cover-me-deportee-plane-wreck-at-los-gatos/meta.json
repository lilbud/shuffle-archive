The rest of the passengers and crew died when the plane crashed and exploded near Las Gatos Creek.</p>\n<p>Plane crashes were hardly unheard of, but what made this particular crash so infuriatingly memorable was the way the deceased Mexican passengers\u00a0 were identified in the media only as &#8220;deportees.&#8221; (The crew and guard were identified by name, however.) The unidentified victims were buried in Fresno, in a mass grave marked only as &#8220;Mexican Nationals.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Later that year, Woody Guthrie wrote a poem about the event, called &#8220;Plane Wreck at Los Gatos.&#8221;</p>\n<p class=\"LyricText\" style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>The crops are all in and the peaches are rott&#8217;ning,</em><br />\n<em>The oranges piled in their creosote dumps;</em><br />\n<em>They&#8217;re flying &#8217;em back to the Mexican border</em><br />\n<em>To pay all their money to wade back again</em></p>\n<p class=\"LyricText\" style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Goodbye to my Juan, goodbye, Rosalita,</em><br />\n<em>Adios mis amigos, Jesus y Maria;</em><br />\n<em>You won&#8217;t have your names when you ride the big airplane,</em><br />\n<em>All they will call you will be &#8220;deportees&#8221;</em></p>\n<p class=\"LyricText\" style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>My father&#8217;s own father, he waded that river,</em><br />\n<em>They took all the money he made in his life;</em><br />\n<em>My brothers and sisters come working the fruit trees,</em><br />\n<em>And they rode the truck till they took down and died.</em></p>\n<p class=\"LyricText\" style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Some of us are illegal, and some are not wanted,</em><br />\n<em>Our work contract&#8217;s out and we have to move on;</em><br />\n<em>Six hundred miles to that Mexican border,</em><br />\n<em>They chase us like outlaws, like rustlers, like thieves.</em></p>\n<p class=\"LyricText\" style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>We died in your hills, we died in your deserts,</em><br />\n<em>We died in your valleys and died on your plains.</em><br />\n<em>We died &#8216;neath your trees and we died in your bushes,</em><br />\n<em>Both sides of the river, we died just the same.</em></p>\n<p class=\"LyricText\" style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>The sky plane caught fire over Los Gatos Canyon,</em><br />\n<em>A fireball of lightning, and shook all our hills,</em><br />\n<em>Who are all these friends, all scattered like dry leaves?</em><br />\n<em>The radio says, &#8220;They are just deportees&#8221;</em></p>\n<p class=\"LyricText\" style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Is this the best way we can grow our big orchards?</em><br />\n<em>Is this the best way we can grow our good fruit?</em><br />\n<em>To fall like dry leaves to rot on my topsoil</em><br />\n<em>And be called by no name except &#8220;deportees&#8221;?</em></p>\n<p>&#8230;and a decade later, college student Martin Hoffman set it to music, and the song known as &#8220;Deportee (Plane Wreck at Los Gatos)&#8221; was born.
