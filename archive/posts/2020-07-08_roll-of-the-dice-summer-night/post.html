<p>Here’s another one for the completists, because good luck trying to make out most of what Bruce is singing in this Nebraska-era home demo.</p>

<p>There’s a narrator singing to his love interest, but all we learn about her is that she’s got long white legs, wears a cotton dress, and has eyes that moonlight shines through. Not a bad start, and it’s a lovely melody, but this appears to be a musical dead end.</p>
<p>“Summer Night” is clearly an ode to, well, summer, but at least based on this recording (which is the only record we have) it doesn’t sound like Bruce ever made it past the stage-setting.</p>
