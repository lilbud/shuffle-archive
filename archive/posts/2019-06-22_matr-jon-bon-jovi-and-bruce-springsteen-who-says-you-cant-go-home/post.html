<p>I’m not a big Bon Jovi fan, but I do love their song, “Who Says You Can’t Go Home,” from their 2005 <em>Have a Nice Day</em> album. That’s probably because it sounds just like a Bruce Springsteen song.</p>
<p>Seriously, just listen to the lyrics and tell me that Jon wasn’t channeling Bruce when he wrote it:</p>

<p>So I was pretty psyched when Jon asked Bruce to join him when he played “Who Says You Can’t Go Home” at the <em>12-12-12</em> benefit concert for the victims of Hurricane Sandy.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the song fit Bruce like a glove. Watch and see–it’s a fantastic performance:</p>

<p>As it turns out, “Who Says You Can’t Go Home” was made for a duet. In fact, Jon Bon Jovi recorded and filmed <em>two </em>versions of it for the same album. You’ve seen the first at the top of this post; here’s the second, in a country arrangement with Jennifer Nettles:</p>

<p>I gotta say: Bruce turned in a great performance, but the best “Who Says You Can’t Go Home” duet award has to go to Jon and Jennifer.</p>
