That&#8217;s because Lewis&#8217; marriage to his thirteen-year-old wife became public just before the film and single debuted.</p>\n<p>Ironically underscoring the theme of the film (the seamy and sordid corruption of American youth), Lewis become the subject of boycotts and blacklists, the target of parents across the country, and a radio pariah. &#8220;High School Confidential&#8221; quickly plateaued and plummeted off the charts as the news of Lewis&#8217; personal drama spread.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the record managed to find its way into the hands of over a million buyers and inspired some notable covers over the years.</p>\n<p>Bruce Springsteen was one of those cover artists, first playing it with the E Street Band on the Darkness Tour in the summer of 1978.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - HIGH SCHOOL CONFIDENTIAL 1978 (audio)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3zdiL_zBG20?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;High School Confidential&#8221; made several appearances throughout the summer and fall of 1978, but only a few cameos since.\u00a0One of those cameos anchored one of the stranger show openers in Bruce&#8217;s career.</p>\n<p>On Halloween eve in 1984, Bruce opened the show in an open coffin, playing the role of Frankenstein&#8217;s monster.
