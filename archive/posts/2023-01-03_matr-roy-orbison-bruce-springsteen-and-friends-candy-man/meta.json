He told me that in New Orleans all the prostitutes called their pimps their &#8216;Candy Man.&#8217; I finally agreed to write the title with him, and it&#8217;s still a hit all these years later!&#8221;</p>\n<p>(Not even five days into the new year, and I&#8217;ve already ruined two of your favorite childhood songs. You&#8217;re welcome.)</p>\n<p>Peaking at #25, &#8220;Candy Man&#8221; was a relatively minor hit for an iconic singer with nine Top 10 hits to his credit, but it&#8217;s nevertheless a great song that stands the test of time.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also a ton of fun to play&#8211;something we can tell by watching Roy and the all-star band he assembled for his <em>Black &amp; White Night</em> concert in 1987&#8211;a band that includes Tom Waits, Elvis Costello (getting a nice harmonica spotlight moment), and k.d. lang, Bonnie Raitt and Jennifer Warnes vamping it up as backing vocalists.</p>\n<p>Oh, and Bruce Springsteen of course. Bruce stays in the background on rhythm guitar, but if you keep your eyes open, you&#8217;ll spot him several times during the performance having the time of his life.</p>\n<div
