There are of Bruce Springsteen’s “” floating around out there that I had to put a temporary moratorium on featuring them on this blog to avoid accidentally creating its own sub-blog.

[so many covers](http://estreetshuffle.com/?s=i%27m+on+fire)[I’m on Fire](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/09/11/roll-of-the-dice-im-on-fire/)

But here’s a version that warrants lifting the ban.

I don’t know much about the Alexander Schmidt Band, and the band itself isn’t very helpful in that regard. (Their YouTube “about page reads simply “…just music.”)

But their bluegrass-esque arrangement is wonderful, their harmonies are ethereal, and they turn in a beautiful version of Bruce’s too-often-covered original that deserves to be heard.

So take a listen and enjoy.
