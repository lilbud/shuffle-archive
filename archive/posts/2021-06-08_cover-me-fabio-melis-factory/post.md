You guys, I’m starting to panic.

When the organizers of this year’s [*Cover Me* contest](https://www.noiespringsteen.com/contest/) asked me to join their jury, I leapt at the opportunity.

*How hard can it be,* I thought to myself. I mean, how many artists are gonna be able to not only cover Bruce’s music really well but also reinterpret, reimagine, or reinvent his songs to bring something fresh and new to the table?

It turns out the answer to that question is: A LOT.

The contest received 56 entries this year–fifty-six! I’ve only seen about a dozen of them so far, and they’re all *so good*.

Take this one from Fabio Melis, for example. I’m in love with his one-man-band translation of “[Factory](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/10/31/roll-of-the-dice-factory/).” Not only is this the best rock arrangement of the song that I can recall hearing, Fabio somehow managed to capture the classic E Street Band sound while presenting the song in a way the E Street Band has never attempted. Seriously impressive.

So you can understand why a creeping panic is starting to set in.

If the rest of the contest entries are as strong as the ones I’ve featured here these past few months, selecting the best among them is going to be an excruciatingly tough task.
