<p>“Shenandoah” is one of the purest folk songs on <em><a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/07/17/album-companion-we-shall-overcome/">We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions</a>—</em>in the sense that it’s almost impossible to definitively trace its origin and evolution. It’s generally believed to have originated as a sea shanty, but in true folk fashion it’s likely that it was altered and adapted by sailors and seamen over the years to the point where the song’s geography makes no sense.</p>
<p>Consensus dictates that “Shenandoah” originated with American and Canadian fur traders in the nineteenth century, but it had spread worldwide in popularity by the mid-1800s. The earliest known version was recorded in 1906 by Charles Rosher, and it can be heard (along with several other early incantations) in the video below, which also features a lot more historical background on the song.</p>

<p>“Shenandoah” evolved and mutated so much over the years because it’s a stunningly beautiful song that lends itself to interpretation and creative arrangements. It’s inspired countless covers, including my all-time favorite released last year by Paula Cole.</p>

<p>Bruce’s version for <em>We Shall Overcome </em>is bucolic and delicate, almost gossamer at times. More than any other track except for the title one, “Shenandoah” reflects a respect and reverence for the source material that commands a listener’s rapt attention for a track that’s uncharacteristically stately.</p>

<p>Bruce’s album arrangement of “Shenandoah” seems too fragile to translate to the concert stage, which is probably why he avoided it for almost the entire Seeger Sessions Tour. But at one of the very last shows, the song made its first and only appearance to date.</p>

<p>Bruce’s live arrangement starts slowly. Accompanied only by his acoustic guitar at first (almost a capella at times), the song builds in beauty and power towards its climax. “Shenandoah” found an immediately receptive audience who listened intently and appreciatively, but the audience reaction wasn’t enough to prompt an encore performance the following nights.</p>
<p>“Shenandoah” works best in its original incarnation, Bruce seemed to realize, and it’s likely that’s the only way we’ll hear it performed from now on–as a proud entry in the deep canon of covers of this American folk classic.</p>
