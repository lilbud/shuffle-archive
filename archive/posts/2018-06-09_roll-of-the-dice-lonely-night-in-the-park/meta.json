We didn&#8217;t have to wait long to find out: shortly after the station debuted in 2005, this well-documented but never-heard (by me, at least!) song entered the rotation with absolutely no fanfare. To call me surprised is to put it mildly.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d long wondered what this song sounded like. I knew it was an outtake from the\u00a0<em>Born to Run</em> sessions, and while there aren&#8217;t many of them, the few that exist are genuine gems, lush and romantic songs like &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/03/27/roll-of-the-dice-linda-let-me-be-the-one/\">Linda, Let Me Be the One</a>&#8221; and &#8220;&#8221;So Young and in Love.&#8221; So once I realized what I was listening to and got over my dumbfoundedness, I paid close attention, and&#8230;</p>\n<p>Well, let&#8217;s just say there&#8217;s a lot going on here.</p>\n<p>Maybe too much, in fact:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Lonely Night In The Park\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CzlPd_PZVCM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>First, that introduction&#8211;it sounds like it&#8217;s lifted straight from John Mellencamp&#8217;s &#8220;I Need a Lover.&#8221; (Although that song was released three years after &#8220;Lonely Night in the Park&#8221; was recorded, so it&#8217;s either coincidence or a lift from rather than by Bruce.)</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"John Mellencamp - I Need A Lover (full version)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uGPP2PbayJc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Then the lyrics kick in, and the scene is set at a topless bar:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Johnny got an angel dancing topless at night down in Toyland</em></p>\n<p>And then comes one of the strangest vocals (not the lyrics, just his delivery of them) that I&#8217;ve ever heard Bruce sing:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Where the blondies and the supergirls offer a sad look and soft hands</em></p>\n<p>That&#8217;s just weird. And strangely addictive. It&#8217;s my favorite part of the song, and I have no idea why.</p>\n<p>Anyway, after that the song settles into a pretty catchy BTR-era hook:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>And if you&#8217;re looking for someone to steal your heart</em><br />\n<em>Someone tough enough to take it</em><br />\n<em>Someone to keep it or to tear it apart</em><br />\n<em>Someone to love you, someone to fake it</em></p>\n<p>Okay, now we&#8217;re cooking! Here comes the chorus, though:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Lonely night in the park</em><br />\n<em>Oh lonely night in the park</em><br />\n<em>Oh lonely lonely lonely lonely night</em><br />\n<em>Lonely lonely lonely lonely night in the park</em></p>\n<p>Okay, that&#8217;s a pretty silly and pointless chorus. And yet I haven&#8217;t been able to get that &#8220;lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely night&#8221; to stop looping in my head all morning, so, yeah.</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s next? Ooh, there&#8217;s a mini-bridge on the piano, and it sounds maddeningly familiar. Where have I heard\u00a0<em>that</em> before?</p>\n<p>Oh yeah, here:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Day After Day (Remastered 2010)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-IiWtFY-vGE?start=46&#038;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>That song came out four years prior, so who knows if that was intentional not?</p>\n<p>Anyway, back to the strip club:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Well there&#8217;s some dudes at the door giving talk</em><br />\n<em>There&#8217;s a lady at the bar, that&#8217;s right</em></p>\n<p>That must be funny, because Bruce laughs here.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Slip off your stool and you step through the rubble</em><br />\n<em>This is your chance, you&#8217;re going to take it</em><br />\n<em>If she can dance, you can make it</em></p>\n<p>Wow, that sounds familiar too! Remember this classic?</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Chuck Berry - Little Queenie\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/s2a2Nrw_6G0?start=29&#038;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Knowing Bruce&#8217;s fondness for that song and its setlist appearances that year, I&#8217;m definitely chalking that up as a deliberate homage.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>She takes off her shoes and runs down the beach</em><br />\n<em>Oh she&#8217;s as soft as the night</em><br />\n<em>You fall and she crawls within your reach</em><br />\n<em>Let her drag you down on the sand</em><br />\n<em>And try to make it all right, ohhh</em></p>\n<p>&#8230;and then we&#8217;re back to the &#8220;lonely lonely&#8221; chorus again, but I thought we were at the beach? Now we&#8217;re back in the park? (There are notes indicating this song was at one point called &#8220;Lonely Night at the Beach,&#8221; so it&#8217;s possible Bruce never fully reconciled the change of setting. Or perhaps this is just a work in progress.)</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve got a bridge now, and it&#8217;s a mouthful:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>And the boardwalk is so quiet at three in the morning</em><br />\n<em>The lonely wind breathes life into a Ferris wheel</em><br />\n<em>Somehow tonight this street seems so boring</em><br />\n<em>Raped and ravaged, with no secrets to reveal</em><br />\n<em>Ohhh watch yourself now!</em></p>\n<p>That melody change is abrupt, isn&#8217;t it? And the lyrics don&#8217;t really fit the meter, although Bruce does his level best to force it. And that &#8220;raped and ravaged&#8221; line kind of comes out of nowhere&#8211;it&#8217;s a jarring metaphor against such a serene backdrop, and what&#8217;s the deal with Bruce&#8217;s vocals again? If the bridge went one line longer, at the rate Bruce&#8217;s voice was dropping he&#8217;d be Barry White.</p>\n<p>Hey, the &#8220;I Need a Lover&#8221; riff is back now!</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Well the bars close down and the lonesome armies they run for cover</em><br />\n<em>The lost boys and their pick ups, man they hate each other</em></p>\n<p>Huh. I guess that vocal delivery in the first verse was deliberate, &#8217;cause it&#8217;s back.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Ah and you&#8217;re drinking &#8216;neath the pier with Kid Blue</em><br />\n<em>And Kid gets sick and throws up on your shoes</em></p>\n<p>Bruce is really painting quite a picture with this song, isn&#8217;t he? Take us home, Bruce!</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>And you&#8217;re thinking of making it home</em><br />\n<em>Oh but your mom can&#8217;t see you like this all alone</em><br />\n<em>Yeah you&#8217;re walking down the street and no one knows your name</em><br />\n<em>Standing on the corner looking for the light to change</em><br />\n<em>Sitting on the picket, light by light, line by line</em><br />\n<em>They got nothing left but time</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Lonely night in the park</em><br />\n<em>Lonely night in the park</em><br />\n<em>Lonely night in the park</em><br />\n<em>Lonely lonely night</em></p>\n<p>And then out of the blue:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Hey little stranger, whatcha doing tonight?</em></p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know where <em>that</em> came from, but I like it!</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Lonely lonely lonely lonely night</em><br />\n<em>Lonely lonely lonely lonely night</em><br />\n<em>Lonely lonely lonely lonely night</em><br />\n<em>Lonely lonely lonely lonely night</em><br />\n<em>Lonely lonely lonely lonely night</em><br />\n<em>Lonely lonely lonely lonely night</em><br />\n<em>Lonely lonely lonely lonely night</em><br />\n<em>Lonely lonely lonely lonely night</em></p>\n<p>Whenever I write one of these posts, I listen to the song 4 or 5 times in a row first to properly immerse myself in it. So now, I&#8217;m walking around my house singing &#8220;lonely lonely lonely lonely night&#8221; over and over punctuated by an occasional &#8220;Hey little stranger, whatcha doing tonight?&#8221;</p>\n<p>I think it&#8217;s stuck.</p>\n<p>Seriously: this song is an absolute mess, but I love it. I can&#8217;t explain why such a mishmash appeals to me so much.
