(Early versions circulate with a different outro or coda.)</p>\n<p>And lyrically, a late verse sounds <em>very</em> similar to &#8220;Wings for Wheels,&#8221; which was <em>definitely</em> an early version of &#8220;Thunder Road:&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>From &#8220;Walking in the Street..&#8221;</strong></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Oh baby, I can&#8217;t lay the stars at your feet,<br />\nOh but I think we could take it all , just you and me<br />\nOh come on and see there&#8217;s a lot of room for you baby in this front seat.</em></p>\n<p><strong>&#8230;to &#8220;Wings for Wheels&#8230;&#8221;</strong></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Maybe I can&#8217;t lay the stars at your feet,<br />\nBut I got this old car and she&#8217;s pretty tough to beat</em><br />\n<em>There&#8217;s plenty of room in my front seat</em><br />\n<em>If you think you can make it, climb in.</em></p>\n<p><strong>to &#8220;Thunder Road.&#8221;</strong></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well, I ain&#8217;t no hero, that&#8217;s understood.<br />\n</em><em>All the redemption I can offer, girl, is beneath this dirty hood<br />\n</em><em>With a chance to make it good some how&#8230; hey, what else can we do now?</em></p>\n<p>But thematically, &#8220;Walking in the Street&#8221; (sometimes called &#8220;Lovers in the Cold&#8221;) is a very different song from &#8220;Thunder Road.&#8221; The latter is a classic expression of desperation, yearning, and escape. The former is a fatalistic tale of Billy and Cherry, who seem reconciled to their lot.</p>\n<p>Billy carries a gun and walks Lexington Avenue, &#8220;casing the promised land.&#8221; A getaway driver &#8220;waits outside the store. He pulls away just as Billy runs out the door. Oh, and Billy won&#8217;t run any more, no no no&#8230;&#8221;</p>\n<p>They sound more like the lovers in &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/06/04/roll-of-the-dice-atlantic-city/\">Atlantic City</a>&#8221; or &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/08/04/roll-of-the-dice-meeting-across-the-river/\">Meeting Across the River</a>&#8221; than in &#8220;Thunder Road.&#8221; (And having written that, I now wonder whether the story in &#8220;Walking in the Street&#8221; migrated to &#8220;Meeting Across the River&#8221; when the melody left town for &#8220;Thunder Road.&#8221;)</p>\n<p>The chorus pairs a soaring melody with gorgeous but grounded imagery:</p>\n<p><em>Tonight we&#8217;re lovers in the cold, running past the graveyards in the snow<br />\nWalking in the street with nowhere to go.</em></p>\n<p>&#8230;and even though there&#8217;s a hint of hope in the line &#8220;I think we could take it all, just you and me,&#8221; the song returns and ends on the chorus, and it&#8217;s clear that Billy and Cherry won&#8217;t ever be pulling out of there to win.</p>\n<p>So give a listen to this never-released, never-performed classic, lost somewhere with Billy and Cherry, forever walking in the street with nowhere to go.</p>\n<p><strong>Walking in the Street<br />\nRecorded:</strong> August-September 1974<br />\n<strong>Never released</strong><br />\n<strong>Never performed</strong></p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
