<p>Bruce’s connection with Alejandro Escovedo goes back much farther than most fans realize. The two singer-songwriters didn’t meet until 2008, and Escovedo’s first solo album was only in 1992.</p>
<p>But on an early spring day on the Tunnel of Love Tour in 1988, Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band covered a song by Rank and File, one of Alejandro’s earliest bands.</p>
<p>“Lucky Day” wasn’t written by Escovedo (he co-wrote only one song on the album), but his guitar and vocals are present throughout the track and the rest of the band’s 1983 debut album, <em>Sundown.</em></p>

<p>Neither the album nor the band ever made it big, but they garnered some serious critical buzz and caught Bruce’s attention.</p>
<p>The original track is dreamy and summer-ish, and in their fleeting rehearsal take, Bruce and the band did their best to honor it with an arrangement that positively shimmers.</p>

<p>In those pre-prompter days, Bruce didn’t have lyrics on demand, so much of what we hear is bluffed. Still, the track had obviously made an impression on him.</p>
<p>Bruce has never played “Lucky Day” in concert, and as far as we know he never even soundchecked it again. But years later, he would form a friendship with one of the artists on the track that would lead to several on-stage and on-disc collaborations.</p>
