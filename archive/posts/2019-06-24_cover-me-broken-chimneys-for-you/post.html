<html lang="en"><head><meta charset="utf-8"/><title>Cover Me, Broken Chimneys: For You</title></head><body><p>The Broken Chimneys is the brainchild/pseudonym of Adam Selzer, a Chicagoland renaissance man (author, musician, public speaker, podcaster and local tour guide) who records under the Broken Chimneys banner to avoid confusion with the <em>other</em> multi-talented Adam Selzer (a musician, writer, photographer and producer in Portland, Oregon).</p>
<p>Selzer (the Chicago one) is also a Springsteen fan, and in 2010 he covered Bruce’s early classic, “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/01/08/roll-of-the-dice-for-you/">For You.</a>” More in keeping with Bruce’s solo piano performances than the original full-band arrangement, Selzer’s version is warm, atmospheric and sounds like an electronic simulation of a chamber ensemble. (It works a lot better than that description sounds.)</p>
<p>Give it a listen below.</p>
