The Broken Chimneys is the brainchild/pseudonym of Adam Selzer, a Chicagoland renaissance man (author, musician, public speaker, podcaster and local tour guide) who records under the Broken Chimneys banner to avoid confusion with the *other* multi-talented Adam Selzer (a musician, writer, photographer and producer in Portland, Oregon).

Selzer (the Chicago one) is also a Springsteen fan, and in 2010 he covered Bruce’s early classic, “[For You.](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/01/08/roll-of-the-dice-for-you/)” More in keeping with Bruce’s solo piano performances than the original full-band arrangement, Selzer’s version is warm, atmospheric and sounds like an electronic simulation of a chamber ensemble. (It works a lot better than that description sounds.)

Give it a listen below.
