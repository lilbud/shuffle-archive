He first performed it way back on the River Tour, debuting it in Paris on the evening of April 19, 1981.</p>\n<div id=\"v-RRqPEpjz-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='426' src='https://videopress.com/embed/RRqPEpjz?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>Following that first performance, Bruce absorbed the song into &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/12/27/cover-me-detroit-medley/\">Detroit Medley</a>,&#8221; where it became a standard nightly encore throughout the remainder of the River Tour.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Sweet Soul Music&#8221; resurfaced a few times (still as part of &#8220;Detroit Medley&#8221;) during the Born in the U.S.A. Tour and then returned with a vengeance in 1988 on the Tunnel of Love Express Tour, where it eventually spun out of &#8220;Detroit Medley&#8221; into a slot of its own.</p>\n<p>With its instantly recognizable opening horn riff, lyrics that pay tribute to several of Bruce&#8217;s musical heroes and influences, and a chorus made for singing along, it&#8217;s easy to see why Bruce gravitated to it and why fans ate it up in its nightly encore appearances.</p>\n<p>But while most long-time fans recognize &#8220;Sweet Soul Music&#8221; within the first few notes, not all are aware of the song&#8217;s lineage. You&#8217;re probably familiar with Arthur Conley&#8217;s original 1967 hit (co-written with Otis Redding, which is a bit narcissistic given that the lyrics of the song also pay tribute to Redding), which peaked at #2 on both the U.S. Hot 100 and R&amp;B charts (and #7 in the U.K. Singles chart).</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Arthur Conley ~ Sweet Soul Music  (1967)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/grE0lwTsSPg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>But the foundation for &#8220;Sweet Soul Music&#8221; had been laid long before. On Sam Cooke&#8217;s last album, released shortly after he passed away in late 1964, there&#8217;s a song called &#8220;Yeah, Man&#8221; that bears some similarity to Arthur Conley&#8217;s song.</p>\n<p>How similar? Well, take a listen and decide for yourself:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Sam Cooke - Yeah Man\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HdkvVlzj5DU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Oh and that famous opening riff? It goes back a few years farther. Listen to the first thirty seconds of the score to\u00a0<em>The Magnificent Seven:</em></p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"The Magnificent Seven Theme\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8XDB7GMnbUQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Given that its lyrics consist entirely of tributes to other artists, it probably should surprise us that the song&#8217;s melody was lifted as well. Conley and Redding eventually gave Cooke co-songwriting credit (after Cooke&#8217;s business partner inevitably sued), so today almost everyone has received their due.</p>\n<p>But Bruce made sure of it: When &#8220;Sweet Soul Music&#8221; returned on the Tunnel of Love Tour, Bruce had updated the lyrics. Instead of name-checking Lou Rawls, Sam and Dave, Wilson Pickett, and Otis Redding, and James Brown, the first luminary Bruce saluted was Sam Cooke. And perhaps in a nod to Redding&#8217;s self-congratulatory reference, the rest of the song shone the spotlight on Clarence, Bruce himself, and the audience:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Sweet Soul Music\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DsfZpMugrNk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>When Bruce put the E Street Band on hiatus after the Tunnel of Love Tour, &#8220;Sweet Soul Music&#8221; went into hibernation, too. It would be two full decades before we&#8217;d see it again (unless you were lucky enough to attend Bruce&#8217;s private benefit show at The Stone Pony in 2004, where he played it next).</p>\n<p>For most of us, our next opportunity to see Bruce perform &#8220;Sweet Soul Music&#8221; live was at Bruce&#8217;s now-legendary Working on a Dream show at Madison Square Garden, on November 8, 2009. Most of us rightly remember that show as the first time Bruce ever performed <em>The River</em> start to finish. But an old favorite made its long-awaited return (with original lyrics and then some) in the encores as well:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Seven Nights to Rock - Sweet Soul Music - 2009/11/08 - MSG NYC\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2d3NR0UEMlY?start=337&#038;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Alas, unlike the full album performance of <em>The River</em>, &#8220;Sweet Soul Music&#8221; was destined to remain a one-off. Since that night, it&#8217;s surfaced only twice&#8211;the first was at a tribute concert to the late Clarence Clemons at the Wonder Bar in 2011, where &#8220;Sweet Soul Music&#8221; was one of several songs Bruce played with J.T. Bowen &amp; The Sensational Soul Cruisers. (The song starts at about the 2:30 mark below.)</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen/JT Bowen/Sensational Soul Cruisers ~ Three Songs! ~ Video by Rose A Montana\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3X9ZAFkAcos?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8230;and the most recent outing was in Kilkenny on the Working on a Dream Tour, where Bruce played the song by request, the crowd helping the band with the riff:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen 2013-07-27 Kilkenny - Sweet Soul Music\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sMLYEWucWm8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>We likely haven&#8217;t heard the last of &#8220;Sweet Soul Music.&#8221; With another E Street Band tour on the horizon, odds are good for at least one more outing for this fan and artist favorite.</p>\n<p><strong>Sweet Soul Music<br />\nFirst played:</strong> April 19, 1981 (Paris, France)<br />\n<strong>Last played:</strong> July 27, 2013 (Kilkenny, Ireland)</p>\n<p>(c) November 1, 2019</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>Whether spotlighting his heroes or his bandmates, &#8220;Sweet Soul Music&#8221; is a reliable crowd-pleaser whenever Bruce breaks it out.</p>\n", "protected": false}, "author": 1, "featured_media": 14039, "comment_status": "open", "ping_status": "open", "sticky": false, "template": "", "format": "standard", "meta": {"_monsterinsights_skip_tracking": false, "_monsterinsights_sitenote_active": false, "_monsterinsights_sitenote_note": "", "_monsterinsights_sitenote_category": 0, "jetpack_post_was_ever_published": false, "_jetpack_newsletter_access": "", "_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs": false, "_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id": 0, "_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content": false, "_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content": false, "footnotes": "", "jetpack_publicize_message": "", "jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled": true, "jetpack_social_post_already_shared": true, "jetpack_social_options": {"image_generator_settings": {"template": "highway", "default_image_id": 0, "font": "", "enabled": false}, "version": 2}}, "categories": [4, 3603], "tags": [2522, 703, 743, 2523], "class_list": ["post-13916", "post", "type-post", "status-publish", "format-standard", "has-post-thumbnail", "hentry", "category-cover-me", "category-encore", "tag-arthur-conley", "tag-sam-cooke", "tag-sweet-soul-music", "tag-yeah-man"], "aioseo_notices": [], "jetpack_publicize_connections": [], "jetpack_featured_media_url": "https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/arthur-conley-sweet-soul-music-atlantic-11.jpg?fit=996%2C1008&ssl=1", "jetpack_sharing_enabled": true, "jetpack_shortlink": "https://wp.me/p9w3Lk-3Cs", "jetpack_likes_enabled": true, "jetpack-related-posts": [{"id": 12293, "url": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/1976/01/02/cover-me-detroit-medley/", "url_meta": {"origin": 13916, "position": 0}, "title": "Detroit Medley", "author": "Ken", "date": "January 2, 1976", "format": false, "excerpt": "Bruce Springsteen's \"Detroit Medley\" is a glorious mash-up, homage, and rock and roll history lesson.
