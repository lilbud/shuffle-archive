On one level, this cover has no business working as well as it does.

"[Darkness on the Edge of Town](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/04/10/roll-of-the-dice-darkness-on-the-edge-of-town/)" is an angry song–anger born out of frustration.

But if we listen to Bruce's lyrics carefully, we realize that while Bruce sings "Darkness" in a tone of determination and defiance, at its core it's a song of addiction and defeat.

Midwest band The Winter Blanket gets it. Their cover taps into the isolation and resignation of the point-of-view character and reinvents the song as one of quiet contemplation and acceptance of one's lot in life.

The result is a delicate, introspective recasting of one of Bruce's most well-known songs, by a band that clearly understands and honors Bruce's songwriting.
