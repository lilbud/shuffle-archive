<blockquote><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">“I don’t even remember writing it or recording it. It was like, ‘When did I do that?'” – <em>Bruce Springsteen, Rolling Stone, December 10, 1998</em></span></p></blockquote>
<p>How talented a songwriter is Bruce Springsteen?</p>
<p>So talented that he can write and record a killer pop song and later have zero recollection of ever having done so.</p>

<p>That <em>Rolling Stone </em>quote wasn’t a joke: Bruce admitted to Mark Hagen in the January 1999 issue of <em>Mojo</em>, “I didn’t even know that ‘Give the Girl a Kiss’ existed… wow, that’s pretty, that’s fun.”</p>
<p>And to Patrick Humphries in <em>Record Collector</em> a month later: “‘Give the Girl a Kiss’, the party thing from Darkness… I didn’t know that existed.”</p>
<p>So it’s a little hard to definitively pin down the inspiration for the song, when the songwriter himself can only answer: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
<p>Still, it seems highly likely that “Give the Girl a Kiss” was inspired at least in part by “Give Him a Great Big Kiss,” which The Shangri-Las took to #18 in 1964.</p>

<p>Although the songs are different in style, the similar titles and choruses (“Tell her that you love her, tell her that you need her” vs. “Tell him that I love him, tell him that I care”) are a pretty unmistakable hat tip.</p>
<p>Musically and stylistically though, “Give the Girl a Kiss” owes more to contemporary Springsteen originals like “So Young and in Love,” “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/12/12/roll-of-the-dice-paradise-by-the-c/">Paradise by the C,</a>” and and “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/06/27/roll-of-the-dice-action-in-the-streets/">Action in the Streets</a>” (which are all basically the same song anyway).</p>

<p>But oh, those lyrics: pure pop perfection.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Well now I ain’t looking for excitement</em><br/>
<em>Baby that’s just a fact</em><br/>
<em>If you want to get to her heart</em><br/>
<em>You better let her know just where you’re at</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Well I say</em><br/>
<em>It ain’t written in the sky above</em><br/>
<em>Well no fortune-teller told me this</em><br/>
<em>You gotta tell her that you love her</em><br/>
<em>Tell her that you need her</em><br/>
<em>And give the girl a great big kiss</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Now if you’re such a fool you think</em><br/>
<em>It don’t matter, baby, what you say</em><br/>
<em>Maybe you better tell her how you’re feeling</em><br/>
<em>It ain’t gonna happen any other way</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>‘Cause darling it ain’t written in the sky above</em><br/>
<em>Well don’t you tell her who told me this</em><br/>
<em>You gotta tell her that you need her</em><br/>
<em>Tell her that you love her</em><br/>
<em>And give the girl a great big kiss</em><br/>
<em>Yeah you better give the girl a great big kiss</em></p>
<p>The romantic pep talk is a recipe that never fails. It’s a girl group staple (and we know Bruce loves his girl groups), not only for The Shangri-Las but also notably for The Exciters.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2sH6h0ViDg">Watch on Youtube: The Exciters - Tell Him</a></p>
<p>(That song would go on to have special significance for Bruce after he was struck by a red-headed woman performing it in a club one night, but that would be a few years up the road.)</p>
<p>Billy Joel would try his hand at a similar confection a few years later as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0pM5dm--yQ">Watch on Youtube: Billy Joel - Tell Her About It (Official Video)</a></p>
<p>But Bruce distilled the recipe down to its one essential ingredient: the kiss. And in combining those almost-exasperated lyrics with an ultra-carefree, swinging melody, he conjures a protagonist that comes off as encouraging rather than frustrated.</p>
<p>That is, until the bridge gives away the game:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Now baby all I wanna do</em><br/>
<em>Is darling make sweet love to you</em></p>
<p>Aha! So the narrator isn’t giving a pep talk to someone else–he’s talking to himself. Suddenly, “Give the Girl a Kiss” becomes a song of courage, and that makes it all the more endearing.</p>
<p>And speaking of endearing: can we just appreciate how much fun the E Street Band is having here? From Danny’s star turn to Bruce’s “Bosstime!” solo to the overdubbed Horns of Love, “Give the Girl a Kiss” features the E Street Band at their most winning.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Now I don’t know what the meaning is</em><br/>
<em>Why you wanna hide the things you feel and say</em><br/>
<em>But baby it’s just a natural fact</em><br/>
<em>Love was never meant to be that way</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>And darlin’ it ain’t written in the sky above</em><br/>
<em>Well no fortune-teller told me this</em><br/>
<em>You gotta tell her that you need her</em><br/>
<em>Tell her that you love her</em><br/>
<em>And give the girl a great big kiss</em></p>
<p>Did I mention that they recorded this song during the dour <a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/07/05/album-companion-darkness-on-the-edge-of-town/"><em>Darkness on the Edge of Town </em></a>sessions (except for the horns, which were added a couple of decades later)? Bruce may not remember “Give the Girl a Kiss” specifically, but he remembers using songs like it to relieve the band after long series of takes tackling darker material.</p>
<p>But the best part of “Give the Girl a Kiss” is still to come:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Give the girl a great big, great big, great big</em><br/>
<em>Give the girl a great big kiss</em></p>
<p>That killer coda: The Big Man bounces his basso “give the girl a great big, great big, great big” while the Boss soars above him. It’s one of my favorite E Street moments on record. And you can tell Bruce feels the magic, because that coda ends up accounting for 25% of the entire song.</p>
<p>But as fun as “Give the Girl a Kiss” is on record, it’s even more fun live–in part because it’s such a natural singalong, in part because of its irresistible hook, but mostly because it brings out the ham in Bruce.</p>
<p>Once “Give the Girl a Kiss” was officially released on <em>Tracks, </em>Bruce wasted little time debuting it live. At the second of two warm-up shows for the Reunion Tour (which doubled in the early days as the Tracks Tour), Bruce called it a “silly” song and  introduced it with a disclaimer: “We cut this for <em>Darkness on the Edge of Town</em>, and you’re about to see why we didn’t use it.”</p>
<p>If he meant it didn’t fit with the album’s theme, well, duh. But if Bruce doubted “Give the Girl a Kiss” as a piece of power pop, he needn’t have worried. Watch this delightful debut build to a hilariously comical (and obviously pre-planned) climax:</p>

<p>With a debut like that, why did “Give the Girl a Kiss” disappear for a decade after only two outings on the Reunion Tour? I have no idea–perhaps Bruce simply forgot about it again. We didn’t hear it again until Bruce’s 2009 show in Hershey, and even then it was only in response to a venue-appropriate sign request.</p>
<p>But Bruce’s best “Give the Girl a Kiss” was his last one, this time on the Wrecking Ball Tour. In granting a fan’s request, Bruce added the two essential ingredients missing from the song’s other live outings: brass and spontaneity.</p>
<p>Watch this wonderful performance from Charlottesville in 2012, featuring a loose Bruce at his funniest, and get your signs ready for the next tour–because we need to hear “Give the Girl a Kiss” again soon.</p>
