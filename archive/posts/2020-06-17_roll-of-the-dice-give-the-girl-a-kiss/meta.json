It&#8217;s a girl group staple (and we know Bruce loves his girl groups), not only for The Shangri-Las but also notably for The Exciters.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"The Exciters - Tell Him\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/G2sH6h0ViDg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>(That song would go on to have special significance for Bruce after he was struck by a red-headed woman performing it in a club one night, but that would be a few years up the road.)</p>\n<p>Billy Joel would try his hand at a similar confection a few years later as well.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Billy Joel - Tell Her About It (Official Video)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/p0pM5dm--yQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>But Bruce distilled the recipe down to its one essential ingredient: the kiss. And in combining those almost-exasperated lyrics with an ultra-carefree, swinging melody, he conjures a protagonist that comes off as encouraging rather than frustrated.</p>\n<p>That is, until the bridge gives away the game:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Now baby all I wanna do</em><br />\n<em>Is darling make sweet love to you</em></p>\n<p>Aha! So the narrator isn&#8217;t giving a pep talk to someone else&#8211;he&#8217;s talking to himself. Suddenly, &#8220;Give the Girl a Kiss&#8221; becomes a song of courage, and that makes it all the more endearing.</p>\n<p>And speaking of endearing: can we just appreciate how much fun the E Street Band is having here? From Danny&#8217;s star turn to Bruce&#8217;s &#8220;Bosstime!&#8221; solo to the overdubbed Horns of Love, &#8220;Give the Girl a Kiss&#8221; features the E Street Band at their most winning.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Now I don&#8217;t know what the meaning is</em><br />\n<em>Why you wanna hide the things you feel and say</em><br />\n<em>But baby it&#8217;s just a natural fact</em><br />\n<em>Love was never meant to be that way</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>And darlin&#8217; it ain&#8217;t written in the sky above</em><br />\n<em>Well no fortune-teller told me this</em><br />\n<em>You gotta tell her that you need her</em><br />\n<em>Tell her that you love her</em><br />\n<em>And give the girl a great big kiss</em></p>\n<p>Did I mention that they recorded this song during the dour <a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/07/05/album-companion-darkness-on-the-edge-of-town/\"><em>Darkness on the Edge of Town\u00a0</em></a>sessions (except for the horns, which were added a couple of decades later)? Bruce may not remember &#8220;Give the Girl a Kiss&#8221; specifically, but he remembers using songs like it to relieve the band after long series of takes tackling darker material.</p>\n<p>But the best part of &#8220;Give the Girl a Kiss&#8221; is still to come:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Give the girl a great big, great big, great big</em><br />\n<em>Give the girl a great big kiss</em></p>\n<p>That killer coda: The Big Man bounces his basso &#8220;give the girl a great big, great big, great big&#8221; while the Boss soars above him. It&#8217;s one of my favorite E Street moments on record. And you can tell Bruce feels the magic, because that coda ends up accounting for 25% of the entire song.</p>\n<p>But as fun as &#8220;Give the Girl a Kiss&#8221; is on record, it&#8217;s even more fun live&#8211;in part because it&#8217;s such a natural singalong, in part because of its irresistible hook, but mostly because it brings out the ham in Bruce.</p>\n<p>Once &#8220;Give the Girl a Kiss&#8221; was officially released on\u00a0<em>Tracks,\u00a0</em>Bruce wasted little time debuting it live. At the second of two warm-up shows for the Reunion Tour (which doubled in the early days as the Tracks Tour), Bruce called it a &#8220;silly&#8221; song and\u00a0 introduced it with a disclaimer: &#8220;We cut this for <em>Darkness on the Edge of Town</em>, and you&#8217;re about to see why we didn&#8217;t use it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If he meant it didn&#8217;t fit with the album&#8217;s theme, well, duh. But if Bruce doubted &#8220;Give the Girl a Kiss&#8221; as a piece of power pop, he needn&#8217;t have worried. Watch this delightful debut build to a hilariously comical (and obviously pre-planned) climax:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Give The Girl A Kiss Bruce Springsteen (NJ 1999)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DJbzwgaln84?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>With a debut like that, why did &#8220;Give the Girl a Kiss&#8221; disappear for a decade after only two outings on the Reunion Tour? I have no idea&#8211;perhaps Bruce simply forgot about it again.\u00a0We didn&#8217;t hear it again until Bruce&#8217;s 2009 show in Hershey, and even then it was only in response to a venue-appropriate sign request.</p>\n<p>But Bruce&#8217;s best &#8220;Give the Girl a Kiss&#8221; was his last one, this time on the Wrecking Ball Tour. In granting a fan&#8217;s request, Bruce added the two essential ingredients missing from the song&#8217;s other live outings: brass and spontaneity.</p>\n<p>Watch this wonderful performance from Charlottesville in 2012, featuring a loose Bruce at his funniest, and get your signs ready for the next tour&#8211;because we need to hear &#8220;Give the Girl a Kiss&#8221; again soon.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Give The Girl A Kiss (ALL) - Charlottesville-10/23/12\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YN6n0O00DMQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>(As of this writing, lovestreet.com is still available.)</p>\n<p><strong>Give the Girl a Kiss<br />\nRecorded:</strong> November 10, 1977 (brass recorded in 1998)<br />\n<strong>Released:\u00a0</strong><em>Tracks\u00a0</em>(1998)<br />\n<strong>First performed:</strong> March 19, 1999 (Asbury Park, NJ)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> October 23, 2012 (Charlottesville, VA)</p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
