<p>The operative word is <em>almost</em>, though, because while the music is acoustic, Delilia Paz’s vocals are still as fierce and passionate as ever. I wouldn’t have expected it, but it turns out Bruce’s “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/01/05/roll-of-the-dice-land-of-hope-and-dreams/">Land of Hope and Dreams</a>” is a perfect song for them to cover.</p>

<p>Released on January 20, 2021 (a date that is almost certainly not coincidental), the band’s cover of Bruce’s hymn to America brims with optimism and momentary relief. But just like for the rest of us, the respite is sure to be temporary.</p>
<p>The Last Internationale is sure to take up their protest banner again soon.</p>
