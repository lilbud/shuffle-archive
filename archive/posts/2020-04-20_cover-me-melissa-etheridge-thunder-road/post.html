<p>Every single day for the past month, Melissa Etheridge has been gifting us with mini-concerts on Facebook Live. Last week, on Day 28, her set included a gorgeous, heartfelt solo piano cover of “Thunder Road” that should be required viewing for any Springsteen fan.</p>
<p>There’s a little bit of storytime to get through first, along with some technical difficulties, so don’t panic when the lights go out–just keep watching.</p>

<p>Wasn’t that fantastic? But about that 1995 story Melissa tells at the top of the video… the performance she speaks of is an even greater one, and it’s one of my all-time favorite duets.</p>
<p>You’ve probably already seen it; millions of people have on YouTube alone. But it’s so good that it warrants frequent repeat viewing, so here’s that MTV Unplugged performance of “Thunder Road” by Melissa and Bruce–and yes, you can see Bruce react when Melissa is a beat late on her final line.</p>

<p>Oh, and that news alert I promised? It turns out Melissa was serious about doing an all-Springsteen mini-concert, and it’s coming this week.</p>
<p>She hasn’t said which day (other than not today), so tune in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MelissaEtheridge/?__tn__=%2CdK-R-R&amp;eid=ARCq6auZ8fWQDHOY0jwqBC35G9CadNy4k4YmPFHsPsxM1Ord-unAsx6AqJBUL568J04y81r0_DCbvyZF&amp;fref=mentions">here</a> each day at 3pm Pacific Daylight Time, or just check daily at <a href="https://www.melissaetheridge.com/splash">Melissa’s website</a> to watch the show on-demand after it’s over.</p>
<p>And in the meantime: stay inside, stay safe, and stay healthy.</p>
