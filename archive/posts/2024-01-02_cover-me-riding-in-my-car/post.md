meta-description: Bruce has covered Woody Guthrie’s social and political folk songs time and again, but it was only a matter of time before Bruce discovered Guthrie’s children’s songs, too. “Riding in My Car” must have proved irresistible–which is exactly the descriptor for Bruce’s cover version.

Bruce Springsteen his covered the work of Woody Guthrie time and again.

Bruce has covered folk classics like “” and “” in concert, and he’s released a studio recording of “.”

But as soon as Bruce became a parent, we knew it was only a matter of time before Guthrie’s children’s songs showed up in Bruce’s set list, too. And really: was there ever any doubt that Woody’s “Riding in My Car” (also known as “Car Song”) would be the one that grabbed Bruce’s attention?

Like Bruce would remark when he debuted it at a 1996 Guthrie tribute concert, “Automobiles: that’s my business. Mr. Guthrie, no disrespect but that’s business.”

Believe it or not, Bruce’s cover of “Riding in My Car” has been officially released–you can find it on , which documents that 1996 tribute concert.

For fans of Woody and Bruce, that’s great news, because we’re highly unlikely to hear Bruce cover it in concert again.
