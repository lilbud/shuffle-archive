King in 1960 and written by Jerry Lieber and Phil Spector, covered live by Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band on October 19, 1974 (and only three other times ever).</p>
<p>This is one of my favorite covers, with Bruce’s vocals soaring above Danny’s keyboard, Roy’s piano, and Suki Lahav’s violin.</p>

<p>The original is beautiful as well–one of many Ben E. King songs Bruce would cover over the years.</p>
