And on a gorgeous 75-degree evening without even a trace of humidity (in July!), it was a pretty sure bet that this was going to be a marathon of a show (it ended up being one of the longest ever, just 8 minutes shy of 4 hours, and that was <em>after</em> two and a half hours of opening acts that included Counting Crows). But in my wildest dreams, I wouldn&#8217;t have expected or predicted the opening number.</span></p>\n<div class=\"text_exposed_show\">\n<p>&#8220;New York City Serenade&#8221; is one of my absolute all-time favorite songs&#8211;although my top five vary from time to time, NYC Serenade is never absent from it. I&#8217;d long ago resigned myself to never hearing it performed live, because Bruce had only performed it a handful of times (you could literally count them on your fingers) in the last 40 years. It&#8217;s one of his earliest songs, ambitiously orchestral with evocative, cinematic, stream-of-conscious lyrics, and not at all what most people would think of as a Bruce Springsteen song. It was the song that was destined to be my unicorn. And then:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - New York City Serenade - Roma 2016 - multicam mix\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/R-1v8w69IWo?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>It took a minute to understand what was happening when activity started on the stage. From my vantage point in the pit, I&#8217;d already noticed the additional music stands, so I figured Bruce had invited some special guests, potentially the string section he&#8217;d used a few years prior on his last visit to Rome. But i was still a little surprised when musicians started to appear and take their positions, and they weren&#8217;t E Street Band members. And they carried violins and violas. It turns out they were indeed the Rome Symphony Orchestra, and when Bruce and the band followed them on-stage, it was clear something unexpected and amazing was about to happen.</p>\n<p>Yes, I was well aware that Bruce had played &#8220;New York City Serenade&#8221; with this string section the last time he was in Rome, but I figured that ship had sailed. I was sure that was a one-time-only occurrence, and I&#8217;d missed it. Surely this would be a gorgeous, magical take on another Springsteen classic&#8211;perhaps &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/12/14/roll-of-the-dice-incident-on-57th-street/\">Incident on 57th Street</a>?&#8221;</p>\n<p>But then Roy played the first notes of the extended intro from this rare opus, and you could hear the collective gasp of tens of thousands (seriously, listen to the video).</p>\n<p>For the next twelve minutes, I was completely rapt. And when the strings kicked in&#8230; I&#8217;m pretty sure it was the first time I wept openly at a concert, and did so for the rest of the song.</p>\n<p>There were other highlights during the evening, to be sure. But this was the biggest of the biggest. (And yes, we were all waving paper hearts for Bruce&#8211;fans coordinated and distributed them, and Bruce was noticeably moved by them from the moment he walked out on stage.)</p>\n<p>When the band ripped into &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/05/20/roll-of-the-dice-badlands/\">Badlands</a>&#8221; after bidding goodbye to the strings, I was jolted back to reality&#8211;i&#8217;d almost forgotten there was an entire show still to come! Three songs in, Bruce took his first request of the evening: a couldn&#8217;t-be-more-appropriate &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/01/02/cover-me-summertime-blues/\">Summertime Blues</a>,&#8221; and both the band and the crowd were off to the races:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Summer Time Blues\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Gp1O7VJEaE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>A healthy River eight-pack followed, interrupted only by a pair of sign requests to jolt the crowd with spontaneity: &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/03/26/cover-me-boom-boom/\">Boom Boom</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/12/27/cover-me-detroit-medley/\">Detroit Medley.</a>&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Boom Boom\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2HpoJRElaJ4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>But if there were highlights to rival the opener in power, one would have to be Bruce&#8217;s gorgeous solo acoustic performance of &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/10/17/roll-of-the-dice-the-ghost-of-tom-joad/\">The Ghost of Tom Joad</a>,&#8221; dedicated to Italian social workers.
