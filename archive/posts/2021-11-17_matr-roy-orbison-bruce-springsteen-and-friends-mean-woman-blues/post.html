<p>It takes guts to cover an Elvis Presley song and think you can one-up The King, but that’s exactly what Roy Orbison did when he covered “Mean Woman Blues,” which Elvis took to #11 in 1957 in the soundtrack for his film <em>Loving You.</em></p>

<p>Orbison’s 1963 cover version doesn’t just one-up the original, it stomps all over it.</p>
<p>There are delights at every turn, from the sly Ray Charles hat-tip introduction to the “Wipeout” cover-within-a-cover, that ferocious guitar solo to the delightful “Sha-la-la” backing vocals, Roy’s unearthly falsetto, and of course: that purr. And those final twenty seconds… play it loud!</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, Orbison’s version outperformed Presley’s on the charts as well, peaking all the way at #5 on the Billboard Hot 100.</p>
<p>“Mean Woman Blues” is one of Roy’s hardest-rocking singles, a song that sounds like it’s as fun to perform as it is to hear. It sure looked that way, at least, on September 30, 1987, when Orbison assembled an all-star backing band for his <em>Black and White Night </em>concert event. “Mean Woman Blues” was on the set list that night, and Bruce Springsteen was in the backing band.</p>
<p>Bruce shared vocals and took a prominent role in a few songs during the show, but for “Mean Woman Blues” he stayed in the background on rhythm guitar. Watch him closely, because it’s a joy to do so: I’m not sure I’ve ever seen Bruce happier on stage than he looked that night.</p>

<p>That was a one-time-only performance of “Mean Woman Blues,” but it was only one of a set list full of classics they played that night. Check out more <em>Black and White Night </em>performances <a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/tag/black-and-white-night/">here</a>.</p>
