<p>How about turning it into a steamy duet with a fellow Bruce?</p>
<p>On the evenings of December 7 and 8 during Bruce’s 2001 holiday show stand in Asbury Park, one of the far-and-away highlights of those loose, festive shows was the “You Sexy Thing” duet between Bruces Springsteen and Hornsby. And if their vocal performances weren’t hot enough, add Hornsby’s star turn on the accordion and a spot-on sax solo from The Big Man, and you’ve got the recipe for a showstopper.</p>
