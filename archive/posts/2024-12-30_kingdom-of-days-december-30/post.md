**1975:** Bruce and most of the band drop by WMMR-FM in Philadelphia for a stint as guest DJs with Ed Sciaky. That evening, the boys play a gig at the Tower Theater, where they tour premiere “[Mountain of Love](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/09/21/cover-me-mountain-of-love/).” Steve is gone by that point, though–he takes ill early in the set and has to skip the remainder.

**1977:** It’s the world premiere of “Because the Night,” played for the very first time at CBGB in New York City–by *both* Bruce and Patti Smith. Patti’s recording of the song is in the can but still months away from release; when Bruce drops by her show tonight, Patti decides to premiere it, and Bruce lends his guitar and backing vocals. Perhaps Bruce might have joined Patti and her band on another song or two if not for the fire inspectors who prematurely halt the show.
