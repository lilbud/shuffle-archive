Robert Gordon and Link Wray were the first to record and release Bruce Springsteen's "[Fire](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/08/05/roll-of-the-dice-fire/)." Bruce gave Gordon the song after seeing him perform with Wray; they released it in 1978, years before Bruce's version debuted on *Live 1975-1985*, and decades before the Bruce's studio version surfaced on *The Promise.*

This recording from a BBC studio session very well be the definitive take on the song–just listen to Link Wray go to town on it.

Bonus: Here's the original 1978 recording (with Bruce Springsteen on piano) for comparison.
