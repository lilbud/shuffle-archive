<p>Robert Gordon and Link Wray were the first to record and release Bruce Springsteen’s “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/08/05/roll-of-the-dice-fire/">Fire</a>.” Bruce gave Gordon the song after seeing him perform with Wray; they released it in 1978, years before Bruce’s version debuted on <em>Live 1975-1985</em>, and decades before the Bruce’s studio version surfaced on <em>The Promise.</em></p>
<p>This recording from a BBC studio session very well be the definitive take on the song–just listen to Link Wray go to town on it.</p>
