Technically, that makes Bonds&#8217; recording a cover.</p>\n<p>But in an open secret that Bruce finally confirmed earlier this year on his\u00a0<em>From My Home to Yours</em> radio show, Bruce not only wrote those tracks for Bonds, he performs on them, too.</p>\n<p>In fact, the entire E Street Band performs on them&#8211;Bruce and the band recorded the backing track together in the studio, and Gary overdubbed his lead vocals.</p>\n<p>So perhaps it&#8217;s most accurate to credit it to Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band, featuring Gary U.S. Bonds on lead vocals.</p>\n<p>No matter how you classify it, &#8220;Hold On (To What You Got)&#8221; is a terrific pop song on an album full of them. It&#8217;s not much of an exaggeration to call\u00a0<em>On the Line</em> a secret Springsteen album, with a half-dozen original River-era pop songs written and performed by Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band (plus a cover of &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/05/08/roll-of-the-dice-rendezvous/\">Rendezvous</a>&#8221; as well). Every Springsteen fan should own it.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Hold On (To What You Got)&#8221; kicks off the album in fine power pop fashion, and it screams E Street from Max&#8217;s opening barrel roll through that glorious bridge to a coda we can imagine Bruce milking for minutes in concert.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Hold On (To What You Got)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FVOKveLJJp0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>It&#8217;s such a killer backing track, in fact, that it nearly overshadows Bruce&#8217;s lyrics. It&#8217;s tempting to dismiss Bruce&#8217;s pure pop songs as lesser compositions, but there&#8217;s some serious songwriting artistry on display here.</p>\n<p>One of the secrets to writing a great pop song is making it easy to understand but ambiguous enough so it can&#8217;t be pinned down to a specific context, and Bruce threads that needle expertly here.</p>\n<p>Is this an on-the-rocks love song, sung by a suitor who refuses to give up fighting for his girl? Is it a cautionary tale, a &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/05/28/roll-of-the-dice-two-hearts/\">Two Hearts</a>&#8220;-style pep talk sung from one friend to another?\u00a0 Or is it a &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/05/20/roll-of-the-dice-badlands/\">Badlands</a>&#8220;-esque self-motivational anthem?</p>\n<p>You tell me:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I work hard, baby, night and day</em><br />\n<em>The things I had, somebody took away</em><br />\n<em>They took away everything I had earned</em><br />\n<em>But there&#8217;s one lesson that I have learned</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>You&#8217;ve got to hold on, little girl, to what you&#8217;ve got</em><br />\n<em>You&#8217;ve got to hold on, little girl, to what you&#8217;ve got</em><br />\n<em>You&#8217;ve got to hold on, little girl, to what you&#8217;ve got</em><br />\n<em>You&#8217;ve got to hold on, little girl, to what you&#8217;ve got</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I&#8217;ve been pushed and I&#8217;ve been knocked down</em><br />\n<em>But I picked myself right back up off the ground</em><br />\n<em>And baby there&#8217;s one thing that I have found</em><br />\n<em>Fighting&#8217;s the only way, so stand your ground</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>And fight to hold on, little girl, to what you&#8217;ve got</em><br />\n<em>You&#8217;ve got to hold on, little girl, to what you&#8217;ve got</em><br />\n<em>You&#8217;ve got to hold on, little girl, to what you&#8217;ve got</em><br />\n<em>You&#8217;ve got to hold on, little girl, to what you&#8217;ve got</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I&#8217;ve been used, I&#8217;ve been abused</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;ve had, baby, my regrets</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;ve been lost, I paid the cost</em><br />\n<em>But there&#8217;s one thing I ain&#8217;t gonna forget</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I&#8217;ve heard some hard lines, I&#8217;ve seen some crying times</em><br />\n<em>Bad luck and trouble, they been friends of mine</em><br />\n<em>Got to stand straight and stare right at your fate</em><br />\n<em>And play it hard before it&#8217;s too late</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>And then just hold on, little girl, to what you&#8217;ve got</em></p>\n<p>For my money, it&#8217;s impossible to tell, so the answer must be: it&#8217;s all of the above, which makes &#8220;Hold On (To What You Got)&#8221; a darn near perfect pop song, one that absolutely begs to be played in concert.</p>\n<p>Someone bring a sign for this one to the next tour, please.</p>\n<p><strong>Hold On (To What You Got)<br />\nRecorded:\u00a0</strong>Early 1982<br />\n<strong>Released:\u00a0</strong><em>On the Line</em> (1982)<br />\n<strong>Never performed live</strong></p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
