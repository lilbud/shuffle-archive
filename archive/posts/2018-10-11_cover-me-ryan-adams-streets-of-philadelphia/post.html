(I’m having trouble coming up with a single enduring musical classic from that year, but I’m sure there are some.)</p>
<p>Ryan chose to perform Bruce’s contemporary Oscar-winner, “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/06/30/roll-of-the-dice-streets-of-philadelphia/">Streets of Philadelphia,</a>” and his affecting, intimate performance was captured for prosperity. It’s pretty great.</p>
<p>For the record though, while the single may have been released in early 1994, the song debuted in the movie <em>Philadelphia </em>in 1993. So I still maintain that 1994 was kind of a lost year.</p>
