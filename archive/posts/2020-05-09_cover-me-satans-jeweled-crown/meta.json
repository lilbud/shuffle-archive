By late spring, Bruce had added The Louvin Brothers&#8217; &#8220;Satan&#8217;s Jeweled Crown&#8221; as well.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Satan&#8217;s Jeweled Crown&#8221; was a genuine obscurity, released in 1959 on the Louvins&#8217; <em>Satan Is Real</em> album&#8211;a country-gospel album that is generally remembered more for its eyebrow-raising cover than its devoutly graceful content. But the song itself is a beautiful tale of redemption, of repent for one&#8217;s past sins and rejection of ill-gotten gains.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Satan&#039;s Jeweled Crown\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4Sju8teNJ3k?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>However, it&#8217;s far more likely that Bruce was inspired by Emmylou Harris&#8217; 1975 cover of &#8220;Satan&#8217;s Jeweled Crown,&#8221; released under a slightly different name on her <em>Elite Hotel\u00a0</em>album.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Satan&#039;s Jewel Crown (2003 Remaster)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DbbHdqVCkNM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>If you listened closely to both versions, you probably noticed that Emmylou inverts the verses and choruses and makes some additional lyrical tweaks. Bruce follows the same arrangement, and tweaks it even more, changing the &#8220;God&#8221; references to a less divine &#8220;you,&#8221; allowing the song to work in either a devout or secular context.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Satan&#8217;s Jeweled Crown&#8221; is beautiful in any of its versions, but\u00a0 Bruce&#8217;s (mostly) acoustic choral arrangement is particularly stunning, a standout in its five European tour appearances in the spring of 1993. Here&#8217;s a gorgeously-captured version from Milton Keynes on May 22, 1993.</p>\n<div id=\"v-6qxPHBSK-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='426' src='https://videopress.com/embed/6qxPHBSK?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>Bruce would only play &#8220;Satan&#8217;s Jeweled Crown&#8221; once more after returning home, at a benefit show that served as an epilogue to the 1993 tour.
