Today’s entry is another abandoned work-in-progress, but it’s one that showed a lot of promise.

This home demo of recording of “I Wanna Start a New Life” dates back to late 1979, likely after Bruce had finished his ultimately abandoned *The Ties That Bind* album, but before the second batch of sessions that produced the songs that would ultimately round out the two-disc *The River*.

We only have two verses (of which two lines are completely bluffed) and a chorus to figure out what Bruce was reaching for, but we also have a gorgeous acoustic melody that sounds for all the world like something Jackson Browne might have recorded.

*We left our home on the hillside*  
*We left our family and our friends*  
*We came down here to ???*  
*To start all over again*

*We left when the fields turned for springtime*  
*We went down there in eight hours time*  
*Da da da da da da*  
*Da da da da da*

*I wanna start a new life*  
*I wanna start a new life*  
*I wanna make it easy and free*  
*And forget about the man that I used to be*

That last line likely gives away the game: had Bruce completed the song, it’s likely that “I Wanna Start a New Life” would have fit neatly into one of Bruce’s favorite themes–a search for escape, redemption, and second chances.

Unfortunately, though, Bruce doesn’t seem to have pursued the song any further, so “I Wanna Start a New Life” never had a chance at any life at all.
