<p>Today’s entry is another abandoned work-in-progress, but it’s one that showed a lot of promise.</p>
<p>This home demo of recording of “I Wanna Start a New Life” dates back to late 1979, likely after Bruce had finished his ultimately abandoned <em>The Ties That Bind </em>album, but before the second batch of sessions that produced the songs that would ultimately round out the two-disc <em>The River</em>.</p>

<p>We only have two verses (of which two lines are completely bluffed) and a chorus to figure out what Bruce was reaching for, but we also have a gorgeous acoustic melody that sounds for all the world like something Jackson Browne might have recorded.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>We left our home on the hillside</em><br/>
<em>We left our family and our friends</em><br/>
<em>We came down here to ???</em><br/>
<em>To start all over again</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>We left when the fields turned for springtime</em><br/>
<em>We went down there in eight hours time</em><br/>
<em>Da da da da da da</em><br/>
<em>Da da da da da</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>I wanna start a new life</em><br/>
<em>I wanna start a new life</em><br/>
<em>I wanna make it easy and free</em><br/>
<em>And forget about the man that I used to be</em></p>
<p>That last line likely gives away the game: had Bruce completed the song, it’s likely that “I Wanna Start a New Life” would have fit neatly into one of Bruce’s favorite themes–a search for escape, redemption, and second chances.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, though, Bruce doesn’t seem to have pursued the song any further, so “I Wanna Start a New Life” never had a chance at any life at all.</p>
