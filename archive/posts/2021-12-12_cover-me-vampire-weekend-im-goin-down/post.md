At a Vancouver concert in 2010, Vampire Weekend delighted fans with a cover of Bruce’s “I’m Goin’ Down.”

Just after they premiered it in Vancouver, the band made a special stop to play an acoustic set for Seattle radio station 107.7 The End before their show in Redmond’s Marymoor Park.

Fortunately, “” was on the setlist, so we now have a wonderfully shot and recorded acoustic rendition to enjoy.

The band continued to perform “I’m Goin’ Down” through the rest of the summer and early fall, but it doesn’t appear to have made their setlist since.
