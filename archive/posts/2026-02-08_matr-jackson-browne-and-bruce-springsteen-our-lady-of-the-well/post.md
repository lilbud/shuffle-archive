Jackson Browne’s “Our Lady of the Well” was never a hit, and it’s not even a stand-alone album track–Jackson segues right into it from the album-opening “Take It Easy” on his 1973 album, .

And yet, “Our Lady of the Well” remains a fan favorite and a traditional show closer for Jackson, who invited Bruce to join him on stage for it (along with its album-mate, “Take It Easy”) at his show at the Count Basie Theater in Red Bank in September 2015, and again almost two years to the day later at the Laid Back Festival in Holmdel.

The latter performance in particular features some lovely guitar work from Bruce–enjoy the performance of two long-time friends and legends below.
