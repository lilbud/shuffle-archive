**2017:** Bruce and the E Street Band kick off their Australian Summer tour in Perth. This is the first show after Donald Trump’s inauguration, and Bruce makes reference to it right off the bat, both at an afternoon press conference and at the top of the show. This first show of 2017 feels like a continuation of the 2016 “autobiography tour,” but this will prove to be the last such set list. An encore highlight: an ultra-rare acoustic “[Blood Brothers](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/12/06/roll-of-the-dice-blood-brothers/).”
