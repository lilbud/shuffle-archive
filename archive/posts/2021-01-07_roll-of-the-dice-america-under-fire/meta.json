It exhibits the extraordinary degree of empathy young Bruce (who had never served) had already developed&#8211;empathy his narrator is in desperate search of.</p>\n<p>Bruce&#8217;s returning soldier is a stranger in a strange land, trying to reconcile how so little and yet so much could have changed while he was gone.</p>\n<p>America&#8217;s societal ills are worse then when he left, and for all his sacrifices overseas, his fellow citizens seem unaware and unappreciative, ignorant of both the cost and fragility of the freedoms they enjoy. They know things are moving in the wrong direction, but they&#8217;re unable or unwilling to acknowledge why.</p>\n<p>It must be\u00a0<em>someone&#8217;s</em> fault, though.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Conquered freak soldiers return from the war</em><br />\n<em>And the stares of their countrymen look just as they did before</em><br />\n<em>And the women whom they love have all turned into whores</em><br />\n<em>And the band still can&#8217;t play any better than before</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>And I&#8217;m tired and I think I will remain</em><br />\n<em>For America&#8217;s under fire, the sky&#8217;s turning grey</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>They step off the train and wonder who&#8217;s to blame</em><br />\n<em>For all this madness and sorrow</em><br />\n<em>The streets are filled with blind men, all viciously insane</em><br />\n<em>You stand there and they hand you a cup and a cane</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>And I&#8217;m tired and I think I will remain</em><br />\n<em>For America&#8217;s under fire, and the sky&#8217;s turning grey</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>And the bombs they go boom like a big red balloon in the evening sky</em><br />\n<em>And the rockets they burst and shatter the earth, making the little girls cry</em><br />\n<em>And the bells they are ringing and the children are singing, oh, but they don&#8217;t</em><br />\n<em>know why</em><br />\n<em>And the airplanes are strafing and the people are laughing</em><br />\n<em>They know not what it is to cry</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Mother and daddy, give them a kiss and shake his hand</em><br />\n<em>Congratulations my son on becoming a man</em><br />\n<em>And the generals can&#8217;t see the reason</em><br />\n<em>There&#8217;s such a high percentage of treason</em><br />\n<em>They&#8217;re quite sure that it must just be the season</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>And I&#8217;m tired and I think I will remain</em><br />\n<em>For America&#8217;s under fire, and the sky&#8217;s turning grey</em></p>\n<p>The band changes up the melody to a circus tune during the bridge, and the meaning couldn&#8217;t be more obvious. But just in case, Bruce appends an outro that blends the end of &#8220;America the Beautiful&#8221; with the theme song from &#8220;The Mickey Mouse Club.&#8221; (Bruce might have had a fully developed sense of empathy at age 20, but he still had room to grow when it came to subtlety.)</p>\n<p>&#8220;America Under Fire&#8221; isn&#8217;t just anti-war; it&#8217;s a protest against a homeland gone astray from its values and ignorant of the consequences. The title carries a double meaning: America is under fire from within and without.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not Bruce&#8217;s strongest song, even for the era, but it presages some of his best songs from later eras, like &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/09/21/roll-of-the-dice-born-in-the-u-s-a/\">Born in the U.S.A.</a>&#8221;</p>\n<p>And it feels appropriate after a day when the sky turned very, very grey.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m tired.
