<p>The first time Joe Grushecky and Bruce Springsteen collaborated, they covered some dark and bloody ground. Joe’s landmark <a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/10/17/american-babylon-a-retrospective/"><em>American Babylon</em></a>  was produced by Bruce, who appears on almost every track on the 1995 album.</p>
<p>Their next project together–eleven years later–was a whole lot lighter. Joe’s 2006 album <em>A Good Life</em> was as bright and optimistic as its title suggests.</p>
<p>This time Bruce appeared on four tracks, including the comparatively dark, Grammy-winning “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/08/27/codeofsilence/">Code of Silence</a>,” a song the pair co-wrote years earlier.</p>
<p>The other songs tapped a different vein, though.  “Is She The One” and “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/01/21/matr-joe-grushecky-and-bruce-springsteen-a-good-life/">A Good Life</a>” are bright, happy songs (“<em>uncharacteristically</em> happy,” Joe noted with a laugh when we discussed the albums several months back), and Bruce chose them specifically for his contributions, which he recorded remotely from his home studio in Rumson.</p>
<p>With a happy riff and sweet backing vocals from Bruce, “Is She The One” came out pure pop confection. Take a listen and see for yourself–and if you’re inclined, pick up the album at <a href="https://joegrushecky.com/store/catalogue/details//product_id:1117">Joe’s website</a>.</p>
