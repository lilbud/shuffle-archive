The first time Joe Grushecky and Bruce Springsteen collaborated, they covered some dark and bloody ground. Joe's landmark [*American Babylon*](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/10/17/american-babylon-a-retrospective/) was produced by Bruce, who appears on almost every track on the 1995 album.

Their next project together–eleven years later–was a whole lot lighter. Joe's 2006 album *A Good Life* was as bright and optimistic as its title suggests.

This time Bruce appeared on four tracks, including the comparatively dark, Grammy-winning "[Code of Silence](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/08/27/codeofsilence/)," a song the pair co-wrote years earlier.

The other songs tapped a different vein, though. "Is She The One" and "[A Good Life](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/01/21/matr-joe-grushecky-and-bruce-springsteen-a-good-life/)" are bright, happy songs ("*uncharacteristically* happy," Joe noted with a laugh when we discussed the albums several months back), and Bruce chose them specifically for his contributions, which he recorded remotely from his home studio in Rumson.

With a happy riff and sweet backing vocals from Bruce, "Is She The One" came out pure pop confection. Take a listen and see for yourself–and if you're inclined, pick up the album at [Joe's website](https://joegrushecky.com/store/catalogue/details//product_id:1117).
