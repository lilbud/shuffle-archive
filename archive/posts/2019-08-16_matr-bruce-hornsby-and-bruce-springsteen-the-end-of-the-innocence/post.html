<p>Most people associate “The End of the Innocence” with Don Henley, who scored one of the biggest hits of 1989 (peaking at #8 on the Billboard Hot 100) with it when he released it as the lead single and title track from his third solo album.</p>

<p>But true Bruce fans know that Henley was only the song’s <em>co-</em>writer–it was actually co-written and co-produced by Bruce, and it’s been a reliable staple of Bruce’s setlists ever since.</p>
<p>What’s that?</p>
<p>Oh, sorry–I should have clarified: Bruce <em>Hornsby</em> is the co-writer/co-producer of “The End of the Innocence,” and that’s him you hear on piano as well.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t mean the song doesn’t have a connection to Bruce <em>Springsteen</em> too.</p>
<p>In December 2001, Bruce reprised his highly successful “…and friends” holiday/community benefit shows in Asbury Park, and this time in addition to the usual suspects, the roster included two guest appearances by Bruce Hornsby.</p>
<p>Among the songs the Bruces performed together was Hornsby and Henley’s “The End of the Innocence,” backed by the Max Weinberg 7. Lyrically, the song was tailor-made for both Bruces, and both turned in smooth vocals laced with poignancy and memory. Take a listen:</p>

<p>What’s the holiday connection? Beats the heck out of me.</p>
<p>All I know is we got a one-time (well, two-time) pairing on a gorgeous song, and that’s good enough for me.</p>
