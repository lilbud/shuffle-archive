meta-description: At the peak of Little Steven’s political period, Steve and Bruce collaborated on the well-intentioned (if lyrically awkward) “Native American.” Watch them give it their best on-stage shot inside.

In 1987, Little Steven released his third solo album, Heavier in both content and production, the album continued the political journey he began in 

*Freedom–No Compromise.* *Voice of America.*

also features Bruce prominently in a track called “Native American.”

*Freedom–No Compromise*

Featuring a recurring Sioux war cry chant, “Ho Ka Hey Wah Nah” (“Let’s go now!”), “Native American” is a well-intentioned call to action for environmental protection. Steve and Bruce fully commit themselves to the song, and their sincerity carries the day.

*almost*

Almost. Because for all its earnestness, “Native American” is lyrically and metrically awkward at times, and for me at least, that gets in the way of my appreciation of the song.

Despite Bruce’s participation, “Native American” was released only as a B-side (backing “Trail of Broken Treaties”) rather than as a featured single. The song never became a hit, despite getting some great exposure in Steve’s opening sets for U2 on the Joshua Tree stadium tour.

That didn’t stop Bruce from joining his friend and (then) ex-bandmate twice on-stage during the summer and fall of 1987, though.

Amazingly, both performances were captured on video. The first was at The Stone Pony in late August, where a hometown crowd gave them a raucous reception:

The second was at a bigger venue–The Ritz in New York City, birthplace of MTV:

Both performances were received generously by the audience, and come across much more naturally than on vinyl.

Still, Bruce hasn’t performed “Native American” with Steve in the 30+ years since.
