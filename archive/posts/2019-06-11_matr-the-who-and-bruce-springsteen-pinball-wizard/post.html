<p>“Pinball Wizard” is one of The Who’s most popular songs (it went to #4 in the U.K. and #19 in the U.S.), and it’s certainly one of the most performed, a mainstay of their concerts since its debut on <em>Tommy</em> in 1969.</p>

<p>While Bruce has never covered it during one of his own concerts, he did join an all-star jam band at the 5th annual Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony, backing new inductees The Who on a few of their songs, including “Pinball Wizard.”</p>
<p>You can watch it below, but keep a careful eye out: Bruce’s appearances are few and fleeting. Max Weinberg actually gets more screen time than Bruce–perhaps because he seems to be having an even better time! (Charmingly, Bruce tends to seem star-struck during many of these HoF jam performances.)</p>
