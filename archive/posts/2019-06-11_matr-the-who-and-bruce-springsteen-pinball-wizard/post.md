“Pinball Wizard” is one of The Who’s most popular songs (it went to #4 in the U.K. and #19 in the U.S.), and it’s certainly one of the most performed, a mainstay of their concerts since its debut on *Tommy* in 1969.

While Bruce has never covered it during one of his own concerts, he did join an all-star jam band at the 5th annual Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony, backing new inductees The Who on a few of their songs, including “Pinball Wizard.”

You can watch it below, but keep a careful eye out: Bruce’s appearances are few and fleeting. Max Weinberg actually gets more screen time than Bruce–perhaps because he seems to be having an even better time! (Charmingly, Bruce tends to seem star-struck during many of these HoF jam performances.)
