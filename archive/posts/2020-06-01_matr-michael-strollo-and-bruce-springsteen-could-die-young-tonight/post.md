In the early 2000s, Michael Strollo made a local name for himself as the lead singer of Exit 105, a terrific Jersey Shore-based rock band. (Where else would a band with that name be from?)

Strollo went solo in 2008 and released his first album, *Bedroom Eyes,* in 2010. Among the standout songs on that album is a sad, beautiful ballad called "Could Die Young Tonight."

Although Exit 105 had already [once shared a stage with Bruce](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/12/02/kingdom-of-days-december-2-2/) (at Joe Grushecky's 2004 Flood Aid concert in Pittsburgh), Strollo probably never imagined he'd have the opportunity to do so again as a singer-songwriter. And given the circumstances that led to it, he certainly wouldn't have wished for it.

In early 2012, Bruce's long-time personal trainer died suddenly at the age of 40, and on the night of February 25th, Tony Strollo's friends and family turned out at the Press Room in Asbury Park to celebrate his too-short life. Bruce was one of Tony's friends in attendance, and Michael was part of the family.

To celebrate his brother, Michael performed "Could Die Young Tonight," and Bruce joined him on stage to support him on acoustic guitar.

Here's their poignant, one-time-only performance of "Could Die Young Tonight."
