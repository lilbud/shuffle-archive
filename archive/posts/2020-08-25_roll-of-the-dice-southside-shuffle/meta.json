Bruce would carry some of his new songs forward with The Bruce Springsteen Band later in the year, but there were a couple of songs that he only ever performed with Dr. Zoom and the Sonic Boom.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Southside Shuffle&#8221; is one of them, and yes&#8211;it&#8217;s named after our favorite Southside.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Southside Shuffle&#8221; is lyrically&#8230; well, let&#8217;s call it slight. But the lyrics aren&#8217;t the point. Bruce wrote &#8220;Southside Shuffle&#8221; as a showcase for Southside Johnny&#8217;s harp skills, which are very, very much on display in the recording below, captured on May 15, 1971 at the song&#8217;s one and only live performance.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Southside Shuffle - Dr Zoom and the Sonic Boom (Bruce Springsteen)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/AjI091w6S5o?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>The spotlight may linger on Southside Johnny (only 22 at the time) the most during those nine minutes, but he&#8217;s not the only young musician to get a star turn.\u00a0 Seventeen-year-old David Sancious dazzles, 21-year-old Bruce impresses, and even 20-year-old Albee Tellone gets a rare chance to show off.</p>\n<p>As for the lyrics, like I said: they&#8217;re beside the point, and they require no analysis or interpretation.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Whoa that little girl of mine</em><br />\n<em>She used to dance so good</em><br />\n<em>Whoa pretty little girl of mine</em><br />\n<em>She said I guess I should</em><br />\n<em>Whoa she looks so fine, that pretty little woman of mine</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Love me so sweet</em><br />\n<em>Sweet like apple pie</em><br />\n<em>Love me baby so sweet now</em><br />\n<em>Sweet as an apple pie</em><br />\n<em>A body like heaven, I know about this woman of mine</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well, come walkin&#8217; down the street</em><br />\n<em>The way she looks so sweet</em><br />\n<em>So proud when I walk with her down the street</em><br />\n<em>The way she looks so sweet</em><br />\n<em>She&#8217;s the finest little baby that a boy&#8217;d ever want to meet</em></p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t dismiss &#8220;Southside Shuffle&#8221; based on its fluffy lyrical substance, though&#8211;the nascent talent on display is astounding.
