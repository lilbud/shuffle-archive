<p>Of all the band eras in Bruce’s career, the shortest-lived was easily Dr. Zoom and the Sonic Boom, which played all of two shows in the spring of 1971 (plus one additional show under the name “Bruce Springsteen and The Friendly Enemies”).</p>
<p>But oh, what a band that was: Future E Streeters Steve Van Zandt, Garry Tallent, David Sancious and Vini Lopez, plus Southside Johnny, Albee Tellone on tenor sax, Bobby Feigenbaum on alto sax, Bobby Williams on the drums (yes, there were two drummers), plus no less than <em>eight</em> backing vocalists.</p>
<p>Their set lists were a mix of covers, Steel Mill holdovers, and new original songs, and their shows were loose and freewheeling. Bruce would carry some of his new songs forward with The Bruce Springsteen Band later in the year, but there were a couple of songs that he only ever performed with Dr. Zoom and the Sonic Boom.</p>
<p>“Southside Shuffle” is one of them, and yes–it’s named after our favorite Southside.</p>
<p>“Southside Shuffle” is lyrically… well, let’s call it slight. But the lyrics aren’t the point. Bruce wrote “Southside Shuffle” as a showcase for Southside Johnny’s harp skills, which are very, very much on display in the recording below, captured on May 15, 1971 at the song’s one and only live performance.</p>

<p>The spotlight may linger on Southside Johnny (only 22 at the time) the most during those nine minutes, but he’s not the only young musician to get a star turn.  Seventeen-year-old David Sancious dazzles, 21-year-old Bruce impresses, and even 20-year-old Albee Tellone gets a rare chance to show off.</p>
<p>As for the lyrics, like I said: they’re beside the point, and they require no analysis or interpretation.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Whoa that little girl of mine</em><br/>
<em>She used to dance so good</em><br/>
<em>Whoa pretty little girl of mine</em><br/>
<em>She said I guess I should</em><br/>
<em>Whoa she looks so fine, that pretty little woman of mine</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Love me so sweet</em><br/>
<em>Sweet like apple pie</em><br/>
<em>Love me baby so sweet now</em><br/>
<em>Sweet as an apple pie</em><br/>
<em>A body like heaven, I know about this woman of mine</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Well, come walkin’ down the street</em><br/>
<em>The way she looks so sweet</em><br/>
<em>So proud when I walk with her down the street</em><br/>
<em>The way she looks so sweet</em><br/>
<em>She’s the finest little baby that a boy’d ever want to meet</em></p>
<p>Don’t dismiss “Southside Shuffle” based on its fluffy lyrical substance, though–the nascent talent on display is astounding. That performance will turn 50 years old next spring, and most of those players are still going strong.</p>
