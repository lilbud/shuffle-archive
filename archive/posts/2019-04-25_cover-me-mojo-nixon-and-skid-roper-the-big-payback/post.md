Bonus Cover Me post today, since I totally had a brainfart and mis-attributed Greg Kin’s live cover of “[Rendezvous](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/05/08/roll-of-the-dice-rendezvous/)” to John Eddie earlier. (That post has since been retracted, redirected, and merged with my post from last year about Kihn’s version of that song. My apologies–once in a while, the daily blog deadline combined with my day job get the better of me!)

I’m a sucker for covers of obscure Springsteen songs, and they don’t come much more obscure than “[The Big Payback](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/11/11/roll-of-the-dice-the-big-payback/),” the B-side of an under-the-radar single, re-issued on a bonus disc of a limited-edition compilation.

But it’s a great song, and Mojo Nixon and Skid Roper did a terrific cover of it back in 1985, even if it’s just a *bit* over the top given the subject matter.
