(That post has since been retracted, redirected, and merged with my post from last year about Kihn’s version of that song. My apologies–once in a while, the daily blog deadline combined with my day job get the better of me!)</p>
<p>I’m a sucker for covers of obscure Springsteen songs, and they don’t come much more obscure than “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/11/11/roll-of-the-dice-the-big-payback/">The Big Payback</a>,” the B-side of an under-the-radar single, re-issued on a bonus disc of a limited-edition compilation.</p>
<p>But it’s a great song, and Mojo Nixon and Skid Roper did a terrific cover of it back in 1985, even if it’s just a <em>bit</em> over the top given the subject matter.</p>
