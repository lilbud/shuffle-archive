**1971:** The Bruce Springsteen Band completes their residency at the Student Prince in Asbury Park. Following this show, Bruce will drive out to California to visit his parents, with no clear return date in mind. The band will continue on without him for a time, reverting to The Sundance Blues Band.

**1975:** Bruce plays his first-ever show in Canada when the Born to Run Tour stops in Montreal. The *Montreal Gazette* reporter who reviewed the show was decidedly unimpressed.

**2003:** Bruce performs a solo acoustic rendition of “[Santa Claus is Comin’ to Town](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/12/24/cover-me-santa-claus-is-comin-to-town/)” at perhaps the most unexpected venue for it: the funeral for long-time friend John Mulheren at the Holy Cross Roman Catholic Church in Rumson.

**2004:** This year’s holiday shows are at Harry’s Roadhouse in Asbury Park, and although there are a pair of shows, they’re both on the same night. Bobby Bandiera provides the backing band for both shows; Southside Johnny guest stars for the early show (joining Bruce for “[The Fever](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/10/04/roll-of-the-dice-the-fever/)“) and Max, Patti, and Willie Nile join Bruce for the late show. Both setlists are a mix of seasonal and eclectic, and both deserve a listen this time each year.
