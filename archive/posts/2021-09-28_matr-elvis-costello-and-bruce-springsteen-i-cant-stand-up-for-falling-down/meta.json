Over the last few years, we&#8217;ve looked at &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/07/25/meeting-across-the-river-bruce-springsteen-and-sam-moore-soul-man/\">Soul Man</a>, &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/04/24/matr-bruce-springsteen-and-sam-moore-hold-on-im-comin/\">Hold On, I&#8217;m Comin&#8217;</a>&#8221; &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/08/20/matr-bruce-springsteen-and-sam-moore-i-thank-you/\">I Thank You</a>,&#8221; and &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/05/26/matr-bruce-springsteen-and-sam-moore-when-something-is-wrong-with-my-baby/\">When Something Is Wrong With My Baby</a>,&#8221; all smash hits from the legendary duo.</p>\n<p>But if there&#8217;s anyone in Bruce&#8217;s circle that can match his admiration, it&#8217;s Elvis Costello. In their appearance together on Elvis&#8217; 2009 <em>Spectacle</em> series, Bruce and Elvis explained what made Sam and Dave so great.</p>\n<div id=\"v-N7IXtKNI-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='426' src='https://videopress.com/embed/N7IXtKNI?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>Elvis wasn&#8217;t just talk, though. Not only did he release a Sam and Dave cover as one of his earliest singles (and his first-ever cover single), he went deep for his song selection<em>.</em></p>\n<p>Sam and Dave recorded &#8220;I Can&#8217;t Stand Up For Falling Down&#8221; in 1967, a live performance backed by Booker T and the MGs. Although I don&#8217;t usually editorialize on the original songs we look at in this series, I gotta say: this never-charting B-side soul ballad is one of my absolute favorites. It&#8217;s certainly one of Sam and Dave&#8217;s best vocals on record. If you&#8217;re looking for the best example of that heaven-and-earth sound that Bruce so aptly described, look no further.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Sam and Dave &quot;I Can&#039;t Stand Up For Falling Down&quot;\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kINmgmDpHqs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Costello recorded his cover version for his 1980 album,\u00a0<em>Get Happy!!</em>, and it was such a fresh and inventive interpretation that you&#8217;d have been forgiven for not realizing it was a cover.\u00a0Elvis played down the pathos of the original, opting for an infectious and gloriously geeky &#8220;what are you gonna do?&#8221; vibe instead, especially in the music video that accompanied the single, which helped take the song to #4 in the U.K.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Elvis Costello &amp; The Attractions - I Can&#039;t Stand Up For Falling Down\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/P7HBhjCMhbE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Ouch, those moves.\u00a0In retrospect, they should have been a giveaway: The entire video is basically built on Elvis and his band trying their best (and failing) to recreate Sam and Dave&#8217;s iconic dance moves.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m guessing Bruce never forgot that video, because when Elvis suggested to Bruce that they bust a few dance moves during their duet performance 30 years later, Bruce shot that idea down <em>fast</em>.</p>\n<div id=\"v-HuGdHJzK-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='426' src='https://videopress.com/embed/HuGdHJzK?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>At the outset, it seemed like Elvis and Bruce were going to honor the original arrangement, but once they reached the first chorus it was full steam ahead with Costello&#8217;s version.</p>\n<p>Bruce and Elvis channeled their best Sam and Dave vocals (although it sure seemed to me like Bruce did the Dave part, not the Sam part he called dibs on), and the results were magic.
