**2017**: Immediately following President Trump's first attempt to enact a Muslim ban, Bruce and the E Street Band play Adelaide, Australia, where Bruce makes a public statement against the ban, tailors the set list to the occasion, and dedicates songs to detainees. The set list also includes a cover of Van Morrison's "[Brown Eyed Girl](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/09/20/cover-me-brown-eyed-girl/)," notable primarily for the fans dressed as classic American television characters who requested it (a plan years in the making). Richie Sambora joins the band for encores of "[Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/11/19/roll-of-the-dice-tenth-avenue-freeze-out/)" and "[Shout](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/09/12/cover-me-shout/)."
