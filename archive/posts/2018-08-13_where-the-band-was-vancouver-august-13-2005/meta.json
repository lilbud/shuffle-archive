I don&#8217;t know if it was because it was his last opportunity to play those songs for a while, or if it was the crowd, or if he just plain felt like doing something a little different&#8230; but almost every song was played and sung just a little differently than on the rest of the tour.</p>\n<p>Bruce opened the show with &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/03/18/roll-of-the-dice-living-proof/\">Living Proof</a>,&#8221; just as he did in Seattle two days prior&#8211;clearly, Bruce was enjoying having Evan tour with him that week.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Living Proof on Pump Organ, August 13, 2005\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PxtqtXjKuSo?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>A few setlist staples followed: &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/02/27/roll-of-the-dice-reason-to-believe/\">Reason to Believe,</a>&#8221; &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/03/02/roll-of-the-dice-devils-dust/\">Devils &amp; Dust</a>,&#8221; &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/04/11/roll-of-the-dice-lonesome-day/\">Lonesome Day,</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/06/19/roll-of-the-dice-long-time-comin/\">Long Time Comin&#8217;.</a>&#8221; But it was clear from the performances that something was in the air&#8211;all three were different than we&#8217;d heard them at the previous two shows, and my friend Kris and I exchanged glances&#8211;we both noticed the heightened performance.
