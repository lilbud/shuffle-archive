We&#8217;ve all been there, and we&#8217;ve all dreamt this dream even if we&#8217;d never heard the song before.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well sometimes at night when I lie in bed</em><br />\n<em>I still see her face running &#8217;round my head</em><br />\n<em>Well sometimes at night when I lie in bed</em><br />\n<em>I still see her face running &#8217;round my head</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Here she comes walking down the street</em><br />\n<em>Here she comes walking down the street</em><br />\n<em>She&#8217;s looking so fine, she&#8217;s looking so sweet</em><br />\n<em>Yes she&#8217;s looking so fine, she&#8217;s looking so sweet</em><br />\n<em>And someday I&#8217;m gonna make her mine, I know I will</em><br />\n<em>Someday I&#8217;m gonna make her mine, I know I will</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Someday she&#8217;s gonna stop instead of walking by</em><br />\n<em>She&#8217;s gonna stop now instead of walking by</em><br />\n<em>She&#8217;s gonna stop instead of walking on by</em><br />\n<em>She&#8217;s gonna stop&#8230;</em></p>\n<p>The lyrics are simple, as most great doo-wop lyrics are. But that&#8217;s okay&#8211;the secret to songs like these aren&#8217;t in the lyrics or even the music but in the delivery. It&#8217;s about soaring vocals, gorgeous harmonies, and passionate emoting.</p>\n<p>Bruce delivered all of the above in spades on the original River Tour, segueing out of &#8220;Here She Comes Walkin'&#8221; and into &#8220;I Wanna Marry You&#8221; (a brilliant pairing if ever there was one) on a cloud of &#8220;little girls.&#8221; (This was prior to the National Organization for Women having a heart-to-heart with Bruce about his habit of infantilizing women in song.)</p>\n<p>Thirty-five years later, when Bruce revived the River Tour for one more go-round, &#8220;Here She Comes Walkin'&#8221; came with it, once again serving as a nightly introduction to &#8220;I Wanna Marry You.&#8221; And once again, Bruce surrendered himself to the song, occasionally to unintentional comic effect.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen &quot;I Wanna Marry You&quot; St.Paul,Mn 2/29/16 HD\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QDxIdEdLYnY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>While we know that &#8220;Here She Comes Walkin'&#8221; dates back to the Born to Run era, we don&#8217;t actually know if the song we heard on both River Tours is the same song that almost made Bruce&#8217;s third album. There are no studio session logs that indicate he ever recorded it, and no bootlegs of the song prior to 1980 have ever surfaced.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s interesting to note that during the Tunnel of Love Tour in 1988, Bruce often prefaced &#8220;All That Heaven Will Allow&#8221; with an original opening melody that featured only a single but familiar lyric.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - All That Heaven Will Allow 1988\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TwBoY-m2PVw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>How much either live version of &#8220;Here She Comes Walkin'&#8221; has in common with what Bruce wrote back in 1974 is a mystery and likely to remain that way&#8230; unless Bruce surprises us one day with a new outtake collection that includes it.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s hope.</p>\n<p><strong>Here She Comes Walkin&#8217;<br />\nNever recorded</strong><br />\n<strong>Never released</strong><br />\n<strong>First performed:</strong> October 11, 1980 (Chicago, IL)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> July 28, 2016 (Oslo, Norway)</p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
