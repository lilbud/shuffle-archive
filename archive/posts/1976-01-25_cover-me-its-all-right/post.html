It gave the band their first crossover hit, peaking at #4 on the Billboard Hot 100 and the top of the Billboard R&amp;B chart.</p>

<p>Bruce pays homage to Mayfield regularly in his encores when he includes “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/11/28/matr-bruce-springsteen-and-jah-love-one-love-people-get-ready/">People Get Ready</a>” in “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/01/05/roll-of-the-dice-land-of-hope-and-dreams/">Land of Hope and Dreams,</a>” but for a short time during World Tour 1993, Bruce made “It’s All Right” his final song of the night in a faithful arrangement to the original. It was a sweet, gentle, and communal note to end the show on.</p>
