<p><strong>Update 12/17/2020: </strong>Mysteriously, all traces of Jason Flynn seem to have been scrubbed from the Internet–web site, social media, videos… strange. I hope he’s okay. I did find one stray copy of his wonderful “Drive All Night” cover however–it’s not as great as the earlier clips I featured here, but it’s worth watching nonetheless.</p>

<p>I have a soft spot for buskers, especially those who appreciate the music of Bruce Springsteen.</p>
<p>So while I don’t know anything about this particular street musician to provide as background, I nevertheless encourage you to take six minutes out of your day to enjoy Jason Flynn’s beautiful cover of Bruce’s timeless love song, “<a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/02/27/roll-of-the-dice-drive-all-night/">Drive All Night</a>.”</p>
<p>Flynn’s rendition is more tender than Bruce’s original. If Bruce’s version is a powerful declaration of the lengths he’d go to for his girl, Flynn’s version is a quiet but confident pledge of devotion. It’s simply a beautiful performance.</p>
