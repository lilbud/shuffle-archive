This one’s for the completists (like me).

“School Is Out” was Gary U.S. Bonds follow-up to his smash hit (and frequent Springsteen encore) “.”

[Quarter to Three](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/08/21/cover-me-quarter-to-three/)

Released in 1961, “School Is Out” is certainly cut from the same cloth as its predecessor, opening with the same count-in, the same hand-clap syncopation, and the same use of background hoots and whistles.

It was perhaps too similar to match the chart performance of “Quarter to Three” but close enough to get some lift from it, peaking at #5 in the US.

Bruce has covered it once only–with Gary himself, on stage at the Old Waldorf in San Francisco, on a River Tour break back in June of 1981.

The sound quality is terrible, but it’s the only document we have of Bruce performing this early rock hit. Give it a listen below (for as long as you can).
