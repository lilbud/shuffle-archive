<p><em>Thanks to friend of the blog Frank Saverio for tipping me off to this one!</em></p>
<p>“<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/08/01/roll-of-the-dice-radio-nowhere/">Radio Nowhere</a>” took on new resonance during the pandemic of 2020-21.</p>
<p>At the height of quarantine and pre-vaccine social distancing, it seemed like we were all isolated from one another. The pandemic didn’t care if you were famous or anonymous; we all experienced it together.</p>
<p>Actress Ashley Johnson and writer-singer Brian W. Foster felt it, too. Foster had taken a shine to “Radio Nowhere” long before, covering it in his performances and posting an (out of tune) mic-check of it to his Tumblr in 2018.</p>

<p>He never got around to posting a complete cover, though… at least not solo.</p>
<p>But last March, back in the earliest, scariest days of the pandemic, Foster and Johnson (who have been engaged since 2018) recorded a version of “Radio Nowhere” together, under the name The Wild Years.</p>
<p>It’s great, but fair warning: it may shred you. It certainly did me.</p>

<p>The Wild Years’ version of “Radio Nowhere” is no anthem. It’s poignant, plaintive, lonely, and it takes me immediately back to those frightening times.</p>
<p>A great cover is more than just a great performance–it reveals something new and fresh about a song you thought you knew inside and out. The Wild Years check both boxes with their cover of “Radio Nowhere” — it’s both lovely and revelatory.</p>
