<p>Some shows stand out more for the setting than the show, and this was one of them.</p>
<p>Not that the performance was lacking–in fact, it was full of highlights, from the full-band world premiere of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/09/06/roll-of-the-dice-across-the-border/">Across the Border</a>,” to a rare “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/05/28/roll-of-the-dice-something-in-the-night/">Something in the Night,</a>” to an always-welcome “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/01/24/roll-of-the-dice-my-love-will-not-let-you-down/">My Love Will Not Let You Down</a>,” to my very first “Rosalita (Come Out Tonight),” which until the summer of 2003 had gone AWOL from non-NJ shows for almost two decades. “Across the Border” in particular was a revelation–it was the first time I realized that the mighty E Street Band is as versatile as it is powerful, delivering a performance of delicate beauty that held an entire ballpark under its spell.</p>

<p>But this was also the my first stadium show, the first show I traveled m<span class="text_exposed_show">ore than a few hours’ drive to, the first of many shows I’ve seen with my friend Steve, and most importantly–my first real full-day experience with E Street Nation. Steve and I waited on line all day long to ensure a great spot in the pit (this show had designated pit tickets, so it was purely a matter of where–not if–we’d be in the pit), and while it wasn’t the first time I’d done that, it was by far the best time.</span></p>

<p>There couldn’t possibly have been  more beautiful weather anywhere than in San Francisco on that August day–it was balmy, breezy, and without a trace of humidity. The line-up area outside of Pac Bell Park had a gorgeous view of the water and plenty of room to mill about and mingle. I had a good friend with me; I found people I’d met and hung out with in Vancouver that spring; and I met people who became instant friends, or people who become friends many shows and many years later.</p>
<p>In short, this was the show where I caught the travel bug, and before <a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/08/11/where-the-band-was-seattle-august-11-2005/">Bruce’s next appearance in Seattle almost exactly two years later</a>, I would catch four other shows in four other cities. And I was just getting started.</p>
