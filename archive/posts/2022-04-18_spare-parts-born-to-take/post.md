I don’t know who RuinedMusic2000 is, but I do know they’ve got some serious and seamless mash-up talent and a clever sense of humor. Who would have thought “Born to Run” would layer so perfectly on top of A-ha’s “Take On Me?”

But wait, there’s more: As great a song as it is, it’s the video that makes “Take on Me” a classic. RuinedMusic2000 took a crack at mashing that up too, and the result does not disappoint.
