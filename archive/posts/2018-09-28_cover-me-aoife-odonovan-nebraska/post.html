<p>I guess i’m in a bit of a <em>Nebraska </em>mood this week, as this the second cover I’ve posted recently from that album.</p>
<p>But Aoife O’Donovan’s cover of the <a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/04/16/roll-of-the-dice-nebraska/">title track</a> is too good to sit on, so I won’t.</p>
<p>But more importantly: how is that I’ve never heard of<a href="http://saltstage.com"> Salt Stage</a> before? I’m an instant fan, and it’s gonna take me a long time to browse all their gorgeously filmed performances from some very talented artists. Highly recommended.</p>
