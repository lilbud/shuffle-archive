I guess i’m in a bit of a *Nebraska* mood this week, as this the second cover I’ve posted recently from that album.

But Aoife O’Donovan’s cover of the [title track](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/04/16/roll-of-the-dice-nebraska/) is too good to sit on, so I won’t.

But more importantly: how is that I’ve never heard of[Salt Stage](https://saltstage.com) before? I’m an instant fan, and it’s gonna take me a long time to browse all their gorgeously filmed performances from some very talented artists. Highly recommended.
