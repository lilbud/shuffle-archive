When it comes to spotlighting artists who cover Bruce’s songs here on the Shuffle, we have one rule:

Do it better, or do it different.

That rule applies in general, but for some songs it’s paramount. “Born to Run” is one of those songs. If you’re gonna go near Bruce’s signature song, bring something new to the table.

Italian harpist Micol Picchioni does just that. Her 2018 album *Arpa Rock* features a collection of classic rock covers arranged for a harp-fronted modern rock combo. From “Space Oddity” to “Stairway to Heaven” to “Smells Like Teen Spirit,” Micol transforms familiar songs in surprisingly effective ways.

Let’s take a listen to her performance of “Born to Run,” and take particular note of how she cleverly inverts Bruce’s defiant celebratory bridge into a quietly introspective solo before gently leading the band back in for a finish as triumphant as the original.

Micol’s fans weren’t surprised to find “Born to Run” included on her album, and neither were Springsteen fans.

That’s because Micol had been performing “Born to Run” for at least a couple of years prior; her 2016 video caught the attention of E Street Nation early on, impressing fans with her prowess in a completely solo performance.
