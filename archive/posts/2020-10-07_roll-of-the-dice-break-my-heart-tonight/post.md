He didn’t have lyrics, but he had a riff. And that was all Bruce needed to gather the E Street Band together at his house toward the end of their month off during the Darkness Tour.

On October 26, 1978, the E Street Band got to work.

“Tonight” (as it was called at the time) was a riff in search of a song.

And also in search of a tempo, it seemed, because they tried it again–this time a bit faster.

But despite at least a half-dozen attempts that day, “Tonight” never developed into a full song.

(All was not lost that day, however. Bruce and the band worked on another new song that day, one that had more promise–so much promise, in fact, that “[The Ties That Bind](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/03/09/roll-of-the-dice-the-ties-that-bind/)” made its debut on stage just six days later when the tour resumed.)

Months later, after the Darkness Tour ended and Bruce began working on what would become *The River,* he took another run at “Tonight,” keeping the riff (and speeding it up even more) but re-writing the song as “Break My Heart.”

That one didn’t go anywhere either.

But Bruce wasn’t about to give up on that riff. Before long, he found a new home for it, and by August he and the band had recorded “[Dollhouse](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/08/15/roll-of-the-dice-dollhouse/).”
