<p>He didn’t have lyrics, but he had a riff. And that was all Bruce needed to gather the E Street Band together at his house toward the end of their month off during the Darkness Tour.</p>
<p>On October 26, 1978, the E Street Band got to work.</p>

<p>“Tonight” (as it was called at the time) was a riff in search of a song.</p>
<p>And also in search of a tempo, it seemed, because they tried it again–this time a bit faster.</p>
<div class="video-player" id="v-1YAm8kJH-1"><iframe allow="clipboard-write" allowfullscreen="" aria-label="VideoPress Video Player" data-resize-to-parent="true" frameborder="0" height="568" src="https://videopress.com/embed/1YAm8kJH" title="VideoPress Video Player" width="758"></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost="ignore" src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js"></script></div>
<p>But despite at least a half-dozen attempts that day, “Tonight” never developed into a full song.</p>
<p>(All was not lost that day, however. Bruce and the band worked on another new song that day, one that had more promise–so much promise, in fact, that “<a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/03/09/roll-of-the-dice-the-ties-that-bind/">The Ties That Bind</a>” made its debut on stage just six days later when the tour resumed.)</p>
<p>Months later, after the Darkness Tour ended and Bruce began working on what would become <em>The River, </em>he took another run at “Tonight,” keeping the riff (and speeding it up even more) but re-writing the song as “Break My Heart.”</p>
<div class="video-player" id="v-oFuAmdF3-1"><iframe allow="clipboard-write" allowfullscreen="" aria-label="VideoPress Video Player" data-resize-to-parent="true" frameborder="0" height="426" src="https://videopress.com/embed/oFuAmdF3" title="VideoPress Video Player" width="758"></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost="ignore" src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js"></script></div>
<p>That one didn’t go anywhere either.</p>
<p>But Bruce wasn’t about to give up on that riff. Before long, he found a new home for it, and by August he and the band had recorded “<a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/08/15/roll-of-the-dice-dollhouse/">Dollhouse</a>.”</p>
