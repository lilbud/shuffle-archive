<p>“Black Sun Rising” is a <em>very</em> early Springsteen composition. To my knowledge it was never recorded in a studio, and Bruce only performed it twice, both times in 1970, during his Steel Mill era.</p>
<p>The only known recording is virtually unintelligible, so I’m not even going to begin to take it apart and analyze it. Feel free to give it a listen if you want to try, but I’ll understand  if you sit this one out.</p>

<p><a href="https://Springsteenlyrics.com">Springsteenlyrics.com</a> got further than I did figuring out the lyrics–enough to figure out that it’s a very unsubtle, of-the-time polemic:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Well there’s a black sun risin’</em><br/>
<em>Shining darkness on the White House</em><br/>
<em>Well there’s a black sun risin’</em><br/>
<em>Shining darkness on the White House</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Turn on the white light protection, come on</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Now there’s a new day dawn</em><br/>
<em>When no-one’s gonna pay the cost</em><br/>
<em>They never ???</em><br/>
<em>???</em><br/>
<em>Oh revolution is ours</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Man has told me to propagate love</em><br/>
<em>I’m gonna get you, oh, oh, oh, oh, all right</em></p>
<p>Yeah, this is one rarity I don’t need to hear in concert.</p>
<p>Just rolled the dice again and got something from the HT/LT era that’s much easier to work with. Look for it soon.</p>
