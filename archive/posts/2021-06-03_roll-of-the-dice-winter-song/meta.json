And while Bruce has always been more competent than dazzling at the piano, his artistry here is breathtaking.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Winter Song&#8221; sounds like the season it&#8217;s named for. Bruce evokes a lonely, barren emotional landscape for his red-light tale of sexual fascination. Musically, Bruce beat Windham Hill to the punch by many years.</p>\n<p>Lyrically, let&#8217;s just acknowledge that &#8220;Winter Song&#8221; isn&#8217;t Bruce at his most enlightened. This is a story about a young man who appears to be a regular at a local brothel, torn between two hostesses&#8211;one submissive and one dominant. But as the song progresses, our experimenting narrator finds himself increasingly intrigued by the house&#8217;s mysterious madam.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>From their northeast source the sour wind roars</em><br />\n<em>Their gifts fresh from the valley waters</em><br />\n<em>&#8220;Hello&#8221; echoes strip Pennsylvania mountain walls</em><br />\n<em>With their corsets and their old Betsy ruffle</em><br />\n<em>And their slips with pearly white</em><br />\n<em>They stand bulging up against the screen door</em><br />\n<em>And bid you &#8220;good night&#8221;</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Summer&#8217;s sweet and she brings me water</em><br />\n<em>But give me Winter, that old icy whore</em><br />\n<em>While Summer lies meek and follows orders</em><br />\n<em>Winter cries &#8220;me&#8221; and pulls you through the door</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>The lymph node tramp cries metal flake tears</em><br />\n<em>They drip like honey down soot mama&#8217;s leg</em><br />\n<em>You lay watching a moth eat a hole in his cloth</em><br />\n<em>He&#8217;ll ask, but he don&#8217;t beg</em><br />\n<em>Said I&#8217;d like to see the mademoiselle</em><br />\n<em>Who holds the keys to all these doors around her waist</em><br />\n<em>And rings the bell</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Summer&#8217;s sweet and she brings me water</em><br />\n<em>Give me Winter, that old icy whore</em><br />\n<em>Summer lies meek and follows orders</em><br />\n<em>Winter cries &#8220;me&#8221; and pulls you through the door</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>With scuffling sound the knot-voiced matron makes her rounds</em><br />\n<em>Knocking on each and every door</em><br />\n<em>With a look like white heat, she sways, salty, sweet</em><br />\n<em>And leads me &#8216;cross her Persian floor</em><br />\n<em>She squeezed my hand and before her I stood</em><br />\n<em>I was scared, it was dark but it was good</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Summer&#8217;s sweet and she brings me water</em><br />\n<em>But give me Winter, that old icy whore</em><br />\n<em>While Summer lies meek and follows orders</em><br />\n<em>Winter cries &#8220;me&#8221; and pulls me through her door</em></p>\n<p>&#8220;Winter Song&#8221; delivers its inexperienced narrator to the\u00a0 madam by the song&#8217;s climax, but Bruce concludes the encounter with an understated &#8220;it was good.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But while &#8220;Winter Song&#8221; may not be remarkable for its lyrics (or even its clever seasonal/sexual metaphor), it&#8217;s nothing short of revelatory for Bruce&#8217;s performance.\u00a0Bruce&#8217;s vocals manage to convey fascination, fear, passion and even disconnection in turns, and his performance at the piano is astonishingly delicate.</p>\n<p>The entire effect is a haunting one, and &#8220;Winter Song&#8221; lingers in the memory long after it ends.</p>\n<p><strong>Winter Song<br />\nRecorded:</strong> January 29-30, 1973<br />\n<strong>Never released</strong><br />\n<strong>Never performed</strong></p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
