Waaaaaay back in September 1967, The Castiles covered Eric Burdon and The Animals’ “San Franciscan Nights.” The song had only just been released a month prior, but it was well on its way to becoming a Top 10 hit.

Bruce and the band gave a pretty faithful interpretation–even copying the “Dragnet” novelty introduction. The sound quality isn’t great, but the performance is fun–listen below and then compare to the original.
