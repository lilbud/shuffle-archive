As I&#8217;m sure you know by now, dear reader, I am a sucker for a good cover. And by good, I mean fresh and inventive. My favorite covers (many of which I&#8217;ve featured here on the Shuffle) are the ones that completely reinvent the original song and make me appreciate it in ways I&#8217;d never considered.</p>\n<p>Almost all of the fifteen finalists checked that box with their video submissions, and I was eager to see how their arrangements would translate to the stage. I had a short selection of a few personal favorites that I was particularly looking forward to see performed live.</p>\n<p>But Iacopo Fedi&#8217;s cover of &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/05/30/roll-of-the-dice-mans-job/\">Man&#8217;s Job</a>&#8221; wasn&#8217;t one of them.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Man&#039;s Job - Iacopo Fedi\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/856UzDiB5zo?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Iacopo&#8217;s video certainly wasn&#8217;t bad, and it definitely was a different take on the song. But it featured a slick, synthy production that reminded me of what I didn&#8217;t like about the <em>Human Touch</em> album in general (even though &#8220;Man&#8217;s Job&#8221; is one of its lesser offenders).</p>\n<p>So Fedi&#8217;s creative entry didn&#8217;t particularly impress me or move me when I first reviewed it, and I was a bit surprised to see it in the final.</p>\n<p>But when Iacopo took the stage in Bergamo, I knew something unexpected was about to happen. He was alone, with only his acoustic guitar for accompaniment. How would he recreate his layered arrangement?</p>\n<p>As it turned out, he didn&#8217;t. He went a different way instead, and boy was I glad I&#8217;d decided to record the surprise I&#8217;d sensed was coming. For a moment, I actually thought he&#8217;d switched songs, (you&#8217;ll understand why during the introduction), but that was just a fake-out, a set-up, and a hat-tip to another\u00a0<em>Human Touch</em> song that seems to have inspired Fedi&#8217;s new arrangement.</p>\n<p>Trust me and watch this straight through&#8211;and prepare to be as blown away as I was.</p>\n<div id=\"v-y8xGamAc-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='426' src='https://videopress.com/embed/y8xGamAc?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>Slowed down and stripped down to its bare essentials, Iacopo&#8217;s arrangement gave him plenty of room to showcase his impressively powerful vocals. All the elements clicked, and his performance of &#8220;Man&#8217;s Job&#8221; ended up being one of my top three favorites of the night.</p>\n<p>Fedi&#8217;s astounding performance landed him in eleventh place for the evening, which should give you a sense of just how strong the other contenders were that night.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll be featuring several more of my favorite performances over the coming weeks, along with my overall impressions of the event. But for now, my thanks and admiration to creator/organizer Alberto Lanfranchi and his wonderful, warm team for putting on an amazing event during a challenging time, and for allowing me to be a part of it.</p>\n<p>And thank you, Iacopo, for re-inventing Bruce&#8217;s song and deepening my appreciation of it. Your live performance that night will likely remain my single favorite performance of &#8220;Man&#8217;s Job&#8221; by anyone, Bruce included.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt":
