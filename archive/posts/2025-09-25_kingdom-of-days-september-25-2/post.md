**1987:** Bruce makes a surprise guest appearance with U2 at their JFK Stadium show in Philadelphia. Their performance of “[Stand By Me](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/12/12/matr-u2-and-bruce-springsteen-stand-by-me/)” is professionally filmed for the band’s *Rattle and Hum* documentary but does not make the final cut. Both local papers cover Bruce’s surprise guest appearance but I suspect only one of them actually witnessed it. (Guess which one.)
