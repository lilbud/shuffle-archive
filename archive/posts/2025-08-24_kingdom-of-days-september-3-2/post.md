Night Two at Philadelphia’s Citizens Bank Park was a Labor Day special, opening with an acoustic tour premiere of “” as part of a five-song mini-set. The show stayed intense all the way through, which may be why Bruce omitted setlisted gems like “,” “Love Train,” “,” “,” and “.” What a show would have been!

Featuring the tour premiere of “” and rarities like “Jungleland” and “l,” the third and final show at MetLife Stadium seems to promise a looser setlist in the autumn leg of World Tour 2023. Sadly, it proves to be the E Street Band’s last show of the year.
