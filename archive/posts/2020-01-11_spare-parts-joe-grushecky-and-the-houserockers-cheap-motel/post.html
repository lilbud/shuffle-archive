<p>I’m glad I started this “Spare Parts” series recently, because I’d have no idea how else to classify this, to be honest.</p>
<p>In one sense, “Cheap Motel” is an original Springsteen song in that Bruce wrote the music. But he didn’t write the lyrics–the great Joe Grushecky supplied those.</p>
<p>(The lyrics sure read like a Springsteen song, though: Joe’s “I had a job/I had a girl” protagonist drifts through the American southwest until he’s picked up by the police for building a bomb(!). Given that the two men wrote the song together in 1995 during the same time that Bruce was recording <a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2023/06/03/album-companion-the-ghost-of-tom-joad/"><em>The Ghost of Tom Joad</em></a>, it certainly seems like Joe was at least strongly influenced by Bruce’s then-current recording project.)</p>

<p>In another sense, it’s a cover, because Bruce didn’t play any part in the studio recording.</p>
<p>And at the same time, it’s neither–It’s Joe’s song (the lyrics at least) and his own recording.</p>
<p>But Bruce’s stamp is on the song through his music and his influence, so it gets an entry on the Shuffle. Plus it’s a great song, so enjoy.</p>
