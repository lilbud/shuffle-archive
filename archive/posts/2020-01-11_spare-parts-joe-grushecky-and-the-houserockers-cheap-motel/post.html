    <title>Spare Parts: Cheap Motel</title>
</head>

<body>
    <p>I’m glad I started this “Spare Parts” series recently, because I’d have no idea how else to classify this, to be
        honest.</p>
    <p>In one sense, “Cheap Motel” is an original Springsteen song in that Bruce wrote the music. But he didn’t write
        the lyrics–the great Joe Grushecky supplied those.</p>
    <p>(The lyrics sure read like a Springsteen song, though: Joe’s “I had a job/I had a girl” protagonist drifts
        through the American southwest until he’s picked up by the police for building a bomb(!). Given that the two men
        wrote the song together in 1995 during the same time that Bruce was recording <a

                of Tom Joad</em></a>, it certainly seems like Joe was at least strongly influenced by Bruce’s
        then-current recording project.)</p>

            by Bruce</a></p>
    <p>In another sense, it’s a cover, because Bruce didn’t play any part in the studio recording.</p>
    <p>And at the same time, it’s neither–It’s Joe’s song (the lyrics at least) and his own recording.</p>
    <p>But Bruce’s stamp is on the song through his music and his influence, so it gets an entry on the Shuffle. Plus
        it’s a great song, so enjoy.</p>
