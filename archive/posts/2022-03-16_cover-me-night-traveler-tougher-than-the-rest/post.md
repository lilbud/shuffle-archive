Night Traveler arrived on the scene a few years back and garnered attention with their eighties-influenced, retro-pop sound and killer tracks like "Springsteen."

Last year, in the middle of the pandemic, they finally released their debut album, *Dreams You Don't Forget*, and Bruce's influence ran deep there, too. "Bad Enough," one of the album's best tracks, is "a nod to some of our favorite straightforward love songs from Springsteen," according to the band's Facebook page.

But the true standout track for Springsteen fans is the band's cover of "[Tougher Than the Rest.](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/08/08/roll-of-the-dice-tougher-than-the-rest/)" It's moody, atmospheric, earnest, and true. Listen to this one with the lights off to feel its full effect.
