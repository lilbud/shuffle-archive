So of course, Bruce Springsteen was going to cover it sooner or later. The only question was where and when.</p>\n<p>Bruce&#8217;s first known performance of &#8220;Kansas City&#8221; came surprisingly far into his career, at a private birthday party for Clarence Clemons in 1979 for which no audio circulates.</p>\n<p>Two years later, however, Bruce broke out Leiber and Stoller&#8217;s oft-covered hit on the River Tour in&#8230; well, where else but Kansas City?</p>\n<div id=\"v-AAvL4f8E-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='568' src='https://videopress.com/embed/AAvL4f8E?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>Bruce&#8217;s first public performance of &#8220;Kansas City&#8221; featured the mash-up with Little Richard&#8217;s &#8220;Hey Hey Hey Hey&#8221; from The Beatles&#8217; arrangement,\u00a0 as would most of his subsequent performances over the years. Most of those performances would be at club appearances, however, rather than &#8220;proper&#8221; tour concerts.</p>\n<p>Surprisingly,\u00a0 Bruce and the E Street Band only performed &#8220;Kansas City&#8221; twice more after that 1981 premiere, and the first one was more than two decades later on the Rising Tour in&#8230; yeah, you guessed it. More than twice the length of their earlier performance and far more assured, this is the E Street Band&#8217;s definitive performance of &#8220;Kansas City.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Kansas City 9-24-02\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ua-rVI2bCNQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>In both 1981 and 2002, Bruce saved &#8220;Kansas City&#8221; for the encore, but in their final performance (to date) on the Wrecking Ball Tour (you know where), Bruce opened the show with it.</p>\n<p>Their arrangement that night was by far the best of the three E Street Band performances, with Bruce making great use of the E Street Horns and Garry breaking out his stand-up bass for the occasion. Only the touch-too-sluggish tempo keeps this performance from being one of the best covers of the tour.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Kansas City w/ Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey (ALL) [TP] - K.C.-11/17/12\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xdCE8JiNYqY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a fan of that brassy arrangement, check out Bruce&#8217;s performance with The Max Weinberg 7 from five years earlier&#8211;it&#8217;s a much stronger and energetic performance.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen-Kansas City 10/13/2007 Weinberg&#039;s House\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/O8ttwMZYuI4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>It&#8217;s took more than a decade for Bruce to play &#8220;Kansas City&#8221; again, but it was worth the wait. During his first-ever concert in Liverpool, Bruce welcomed a local boy to the stage for an electrifying couple of songs.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen brings out Paul McCartney in Liverpool - 07/06/2025\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/X0o4MT_Lwxo?start=211&#038;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;Kansas City&#8221; is one of those songs that&#8217;s too perennially popular to disappear for good. Whether at a surprise club appearance or a stadium concert, we&#8217;re almost certain to hear Bruce play it again.</p>\n<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> Most of Bruce&#8217;s off-tour performances have been via surprise guest appearances at Jersey Shore clubs. In 1982, Bruce joined Cats on a Smooth Surface at The Stone Pony; in 1989, he was with Bobby Bandiera at Martell&#8217;s Sea Breeze; in 1994, he played it with Joe Grushecky and The Houserockers at Marz American Style.</p>\n<p>But one night in 1987, Bruce (and most of the E Street Band) joined Cats on a Smooth Surface on stage at The Stone Pony for a twelve-song set, and when they closed the show with a &#8220;Kansas City&#8221; encore, they were joined by another very special guest: Jon Bon Jovi. A couple of minutes of fragmented video exist from that performance&#8211;enjoy it below.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Springsteen w/ Jon Bon Jovi -
