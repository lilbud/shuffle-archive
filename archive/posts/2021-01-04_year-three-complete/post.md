Today marks the end of Year Three for this blog!

It also marks:

- 2,273 blog posts over 1,096 consecutive days of daily publishing
- The completion of my annual refresh project–every Roll of the Dice, Cover Me, and Meeting Across the River entry is now refreshed with repaired media links and new cross-site links.
- The end of the Kingdom of Days series (but don’t worry–it restarts tomorrow!)
- The beginning of what will probably be my last full year writing this blog. (I expect to reach the end sometime in late 2022, unless Bruce releases a massive box set or is otherwise prolific during that time.)


Whether you’ve been with me from the beginning or just discovered this site for the first time today, I wanted to take a moment to thank you for reading, following, commenting, liking and/or sharing.

I am deeply humbled by the ever-growing number of daily visitors to the Shuffle, which doubled this year from the previous one (which itself was twice the year prior). At this rate, my little blog will reach its one millionth view before the end of the month, which is something I can’t even wrap my head around at the moment.

(And that doesn’t even account for those of you who subscribe and are reading this in your inbox right now instead of your browser–you account for over a million e-mails this past year alone!)

As always, special thanks to those of you who have written to me with corrections, additional information, absolutely amazing “I was there” stories (especially my “[Where the Band Was](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/category/where-the-band-was/)” guest bloggers who gave me welcome writing reprieves from time to time–please drop me a line if you’d like to share your story too), personal anecdotes, and alternative interpretations. That’s been my absolute favorite part of these three years, and as a result I feel like I’ve learned at least as much as I’ve shared.

My profound thanks in particular to Lori Pierce, who not only takes the time to read every post but cares enough to write to me (usually within minutes of an article’s publication) to alert me whenever I publish an article with typos (which is the vast majority of days, embarrassingly). She makes me look much more polished than I actually am.

As mentioned above, today marks the end of the year-long “[Kingdom of Days](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/category/kingdom-of-days/)” series–but if you enjoy those, fear not: the series restarts tomorrow, with new events from 2020, repaired and fresh media, and new information turned up during my research this past year.

In addition, I’ll continue to spotlight an [original Springsteen song](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/roll-of-the-dice-album-by-album/), [cover](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/category/cover-me/), or [team-up](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/category/meeting-across-the-river/) each day, as long as my health permits at least (which is something none of us can take for granted at the moment).

According to my tracking spreadsheet, I still have about 550 articles left to write before I bring this project to a close–assuming Bruce doesn’t release or cover any new music between now and then (which of course, he probably will). So we’ve still got a long way to travel together, and I hope you stick with me for the rest of the ride.

Thanks again for reading. Onward to Year Four!
