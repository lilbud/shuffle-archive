<p>Country duo Thompson Square are husband and wife. Maybe that’s why their take on “<a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/02/06/roll-of-the-dice-brilliant-disguise/">Brilliant Disguise</a>” has a very different feel than turns taken by other artists.</p>
<p>Bruce has often stated that the song takes on a different meaning if you sing it with the right person:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“When you sing this song with someone you love, it turns into something else…  a reaffirmation of loves’ mysteries, its shadows, frailties and acceptance of those frailties, without which there is no love.”</em></p>
<p>Keifer and Shawna Thompson certainly capture that spirit here.</p>
