I know, I know.

I sure do take vacations an awful lot these days, don’t I?

But this one’s short–only two days–and once again it’s a working vacation, because I’ve been covering events and writing for Backstreets. (Current events coverage doesn’t really fit the format here.) And as always, never skips a beat, so technically the daily commitment continues.

*Kingdom of Days*

And because I love you, I brought you back something!

This past Monday night, I attended Stand Up For Heroes in New York City, my third time at the annual Bob Woodruff Foundation benefit for veterans and their families. and my favorite time as well.

Bruce performed four songs (all with dirty jokes serving as introductions), including the public debut of “” and an ultra-rare acoustic “.” I captured his entire set on video, and I think they came out great. Enjoy them below:

As this piece publishes, I’m on my way to Pittsburgh to catch Joe Grushecky and The Houserockers at a special hometown concert to celebrate the release of the new 25th Anniversary edition of . The show is tonight, and thanks to Little Steven’s Underground Garage, you can watch it for free from the comfort of your own home. Join Joe and the band (and me in the audience!) .

I can’t recommend the album highly enough, and there’s that you’re going to want to check out. (Apple Music subscribers, make sure you block off Friday at 5pm Eastern on your calendars!)

That’s all for now, but I’ll be back tomorrow with a couple more special treats. (So maybe this isn’t really a break after all?)

Anyway, thanks for sticking with me while I moonlight a bit. I’ll be back home and blogging away again in a couple of days–look for a new this weekend.
