It was ultimately dropped very late in the game, and that&#8217;s too bad&#8211;because much like &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/12/21/roll-of-the-dice-hungry-heart/\">Hungry Heart</a>,&#8221; it combines the trappings of romantic pop with darker lyrics and undertones. It would have fit very nicely on the album. Let&#8217;s take a listen.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Cindy\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZlI-L52KrnY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Bruce doesn&#8217;t waste any time&#8211;there&#8217;s no introduction here, just a cold open into a first verse that immediately establishes our sympathies for the singer:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>I pick you up with flowers when you get off of work</em><br />\n<em>It&#8217;s like you don&#8217;t even care, it&#8217;s like I&#8217;m some kind of jerk</em><br />\n<em>I take you out on a date and then you won&#8217;t even kiss me</em><br />\n<em>Boy, when I ain&#8217;t around I&#8217;ll bet you don&#8217;t even miss me</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>I don&#8217;t know why, I love you like I do</em><br />\n<em>I try and try, you treat me like a fool</em><br />\n<em>It makes me wanna cry, it makes me feel so blue</em><br />\n<em>But I just do, baby, I just do</em></p>\n<p>Poor guy! He&#8217;s trying his best to be a good boyfriend, isn&#8217;t he? He&#8217;s attentive, doting even, but his girl just seems to take him for granted.</p>\n<p>Or does she?</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>I call you up just to pass the time</em><br />\n<em>Soon as you hear my voice you disconnect the line</em><br />\n<em>And when I call you back, your mother says you ain&#8217;t home</em><br />\n<em>Cindy, I know that&#8217;s you on the other end of this phone</em></p>\n<p>Um.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, this doesn&#8217;t exactly sounds like an established relationship, healthy or otherwise. I suppose it could just be a lovers&#8217; quarrel&#8230; maybe our narrator is right, and it&#8217;s not Cindy&#8217;s mom on the phone but rather Cindy herself trying to get him to stop calling. That would be pretty mean, but it seems our self-styled hero likes it that way:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Now in this world there ain&#8217;t another like you</em><br />\n<em>My little candy girl, so hard-hearted and cruel</em><br />\n<em>I think that&#8217;s what keeps me coming back</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;m a fool for you Cindy and I like it like that</em></p>\n<p>But then the next verse makes it pretty clear that if Cindy really is cruel, her parents have her back:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>I came to get you last night, Cindy, at quarter to six</em><br />\n<em>Your daddy came to the door, he said Cindy got sick</em><br />\n<em>She got sent home from work with a note from the nurse</em><br />\n<em>And that my very own presence would make your condition worse</em></p>\n<p>&#8230;and then Bruce makes it clear that the narrator&#8217;s intentions aren&#8217;t as virtuous as he&#8217;d led us to believe:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>But it ain&#8217;t your health, &#8217;cause honey you sure look fine</em><br />\n<em>Little girl it&#8217;s something else that&#8217;s on my mind</em><br />\n<em>But whatever you&#8217;ve got, well you can give it to me</em><br />\n<em>&#8216;Cause if it&#8217;s good enough for you, it&#8217;s good enough for me</em></p>\n<p>So yeah, we&#8217;re in full-on creep mode now.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>I don&#8217;t know why, I love you like I do</em><br />\n<em>You make me cry and feel like such a fool</em><br />\n<em>I guess I like it when you hurt me this way</em><br />\n<em>You dish it out and I just put it away</em></p>\n<p>&#8230;and that&#8217;s where we leave our characters, with no indication that Cindy will ever be free of her would-be Romeo, despite her consistent signals of disinterest. Bruce has played a clever trick: rather than putting his characters through a story arc, he takes the listener on a ride instead. The song&#8217;s characters don&#8217;t change, but our perceptions of them do. It&#8217;s a neat feat to pull off in two and a half minutes&#8211;impressive enough that we&#8217;ll forgive Bruce the occasionally clumsy meter (there are several places where Bruce works hard to stretch or compress syllables to fit the melody).</p>\n<p>&#8220;Cindy&#8221; had been floating around for years in bootleg form before it was released on original single-disc version of <em>The River</em>\u00a0\u00a0that accompanied that album&#8217;s\u00a0anniversary box set, and the official version is essentially identical to the bootleg. There is a curious unofficial mix, though, with Clarence providing harmony vocals dialed up way too high in the mix (especially because he flubs the lyrics in a couple of places). It&#8217;s an interesting listen, but Bruce made the right decision in submerging Clarence&#8217;s vocals in the final mix.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen Cindy #2 Alternate Take with Clarence\u00b4s harmony vocals\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HJF0WbQuKvw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;Cindy&#8221; has never been performed live, and even though Bruce makes no attempts to justify or redeem his point-of-view character, in the post-#metoo era, it&#8217;s unlikely it ever will.</p>\n<p><strong>Cindy</strong><br />\n<strong>Recorded:</strong> July 16, 1979<br />\n<strong>Released:</strong>\u00a0<em>The Ties That Bind: The River Collection</em> (2015)<br />\n<strong>Never performed live</strong></p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
