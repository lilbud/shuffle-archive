I've never used this blog to promote events before, but we're all together in uncharted territory at the moment.

So if you're doing the responsible thing and staying home to halt the spread of the global pandemic, first of all: *thank you*. I know it's hard, and the costs vary for each of us, but we're all saving lives.

Second, although it's far, far, *far* from the most dire consequence of our current situation, I can't help but miss the presence of live music in my life–and I know from exchanging e-mail, tweets, and facebook comments that many of you feel the same way.

So I want to make sure that no one misses out on a couple of great upcoming events because they didn't know about it in time. If you're a Springsteen fan (and if not, why else are you reading this blog?), here are a couple of watch-from-home events you won't want to miss:

![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ET007ZjWkAYyPrn) Tomorrow night, March 25th at 8pm Eastern Daylight Time (not EST as it says in the graphic), the great Joe Grushecky will perform live, presumably from his home.

I feature Joe's music frequently here on the Shuffle due to his [many, many collaborations](https://estreetshuffle.com/?s=grushecky) with Bruce and their decades-long friendship, but if you haven't checked out his music before, here's a great opportunity to do so. I'll be on the livestream on Joe's facebook page–hope to see you there, too.

Next up: a [very special benefit concert](https://www.facebook.com/events/552991608622664/?acontext=%7B%22source%22%3A1%2C%22action_history%22%3A%22%5B%7B%5C%22surface%5C%22%3A%5C%22permalink%5C%22%2C%5C%22mechanism%5C%22%3A%5C%22surface%5C%22%2C%5C%22extra_data%5C%22%3A%5B%5D%7D%5D%22%2C%22has_source%22%3Atrue%7D&source=1&action_history=%5B%7B%22surface%22%3A%22permalink%22%2C%22mechanism%22%3A%22surface%22%2C%22extra_data%22%3A%5B%5D%7D%5D&has_source=1&__tn__=%2CdK-R-R&eid=ARBdjHjJtua2-GQUpYv9Q_ZFSAd6mbaKK2lVetIJez6kfnqvscPhIFNqe5dd3IUBY1xZvwcw_Oe6DjqT&fref=mentions) by some of the best musicians on the Jersey Shore, all performing from their homes. Many of the names below will be familiar to fans of Bruce Springsteen and the Asbury Park music scene, but trust me–even if you're not familiar with most of the artists, this is bound to be a great event for any fan of the Jersey Shore sound.

RSVP [here](https://www.facebook.com/events/552991608622664/), and join me (virtually) at the show from the comfort of your own home on Saturday, April 4th at 8pm EDT.

Finally, while Bruce has yet to join the group of artists performing live over the Internet, that doesn't mean he's not doing what he can to help his community. For those of you in the New Jersey area, who have family and friends in New Jersey, or who appreciate all the great music and memories brought to you from the garden state, consider responding to Bruce's plea below by supporting the New Jersey Pandemic Relief Fund.

That's it for now, but hopefully there will be even more live music to help us through the months ahead.

In the meantime, as long as I stay healthy, I'll keep my twice-daily update streak (now at 810 consecutive days and counting) going, with occasional bonus posts like this one. I hope it provides a little daily diversion to your stay-at-home routine!

Stay well and healthy, everyone!
