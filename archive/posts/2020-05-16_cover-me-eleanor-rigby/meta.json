Employing an unusual (for a rock song) string octet, &#8220;Eleanor Rigby&#8221; is essentially a Paul McCartney vocal track with backgrounds from John and George.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"The Beatles - Eleanor Rigby (From &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HuS5NuXRb5Y?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Released in August 1966, &#8220;Eleanor Rigby&#8221; topped the UK singles chart and peaked at #11 on the Billboard Hot 100. It was barely a year later when Bruce Springsteen&#8217;s high school band, The Castiles, decided to have a go at it.</p>\n<p>By the late summer of 1967, The Castiles were getting increasingly daring with their cover-filled sets as their confidence and competence grew. On the night of September 16, the lads played The Left Foot in Bruce&#8217;s home town of Freehold, and while Bruce had not yet evolved into the band&#8217;s permanent frontman, he demonstrated his guitar prowess that night by fearlessly tackling &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/04/21/cover-me-jeffs-boogie/\">Jeff&#8217;s Boogie</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/02/19/cover-me-purple-haze/\">Purple Haze</a>,&#8221; among others.</p>\n<p>But those songs were already guitar hero showcases. As the end of the show drew near, The Castiles launched into a cover of &#8220;Eleanor Rigby.&#8221; With no strings in sight, how would last summer&#8217;s big hit translate to the Left Foot stage?</p>\n<p>Pretty impressively, as it turns out. Take a listen to that night&#8217;s performance, captured and preserved on tape more than a half-century ago. You&#8217;ll hear Bruce&#8217;s band-mate George Theiss on lead vocals, but that&#8217;s Bruce on a very prominent lead guitar and backing vocals.</p>\n<div id=\"v-TJoHKklJ-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='426' src='https://videopress.com/embed/TJoHKklJ?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>What&#8217;s most impressive to me about that performance is the Indian-influenced arrangement&#8211;I&#8217;d love to know who came up with it and where the inspiration came from.
