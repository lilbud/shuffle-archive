<p>Honestly, he didn’t have to look very hard.</p>
<p>“I Wish It Would Rain” ranks as one of the most heart-wrenching songs in the Motown catalog, peaking at #4 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1968 and topping the R&amp;B chart. Audiences viscerally responded to David Ruffin’s anguished, impassioned vocals, but few knew the tragedy that imbued the lyrics.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1967, songwriter Roger Penzabene discovered his wife was having an affair. Consumed with betrayal, he poured his pain into a song about a man so miserable that he hides himself from the world, hoping for rainfall to mask his tears so that he might walk the world freely and without shame.</p>
<p>The Temptations recorded “I Wish It Would Rain” that summer and released it on December 21st. Ten days later, Penzabene took his own life.</p>
<p>Unaware of the tragic backstory, audiences nevertheless flocked to “I Wish It Would Rain,” drawn in by Ruffin’s vocals set starkly against a minimalist arrangement.</p>
<p>When the strings enter about halfway through, one can’t help but notice the similarity to The Temptations’ earlier hit, “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/10/26/matr-the-temptations-the-wallflowers-and-bruce-springsteen-my-girl/">My Girl.</a>” In fact, from the very first line (“Sunshine, blue skies, please go away”), “I Wish It Would Rain” sounds like a mournful answer song. I’ve never seen it hypothesized, much less confirmed, but I wouldn’t be at all surprised if that was by design.</p>

<p>“I Wish It Would Rain” climbed the charts swiftly, peaking in February. It soon became a melancholy R&amp;B standard, covered over the years by heavyweights like Aretha Franklin, Marvin Gaye, Tina Turner, and Gladys Knight.</p>
<p>That’s some serious talent to throw down with, but Springsteen wasn’t deterred. He understood that “I Wish It Would Rain” dares any contender to meet it in a place of anguish, and Bruce gave it his all.  He matched Ruffin growl for growl while adding a layer of vulnerability via his inimitable falsetto.</p>

<p>The arrangement is faithful, even if the antagonist isn’t, and the lyrical changes are tactfully minor. (Bruce sings “My girl has found another and gone <em>astray</em>” instead of “gone <em>away,</em>” a small but fitting substitution.)</p>
<p>The finished track is one of Bruce’s favorites on the album. “I just felt great,” he recollected to Greene. “It came out great, so we used it.”</p>
<p>It’s one of my favorites, too. If that rumored <em>Only the Strong Survive </em>mini-tour ever comes to pass, maybe we’ll even get to hear it live someday.</p>
