I was still pretty tired from the cross-country red-eye and the long show the night before, and I seriously considered sitting in the stands for this one. But my cousin and her husband were going to be in the pit, and I hadn&#8217;t seen them in a long time. So I decided to push through it and stick with my pit ticket.

It hit me at that moment: he&#8217;d completely skipped that the night before. He&#8217;d honored a few requests at the tail end of the main set, but otherwise the show was pretty well scripted.

St. Louis &#8217;08 may have matched it in surprises and topped it in terms of the bands form and intensity, but I&#8217;d never seen a show this loose.</p>\n<p>All told, there were 18 songs in this show that were different from the first night, and to give you a sense of how much we deviated from the setlist, here are the songs that Bruce was supposed to have played but didn&#8217;t: &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/10/31/roll-of-the-dice-night/\">Night</a>,&#8221; &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/11/27/roll-of-the-dice-jack-of-all-trades/\">Jack of All Trades</a>,&#8221; &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/11/04/roll-of-the-dice-jackson-cage/\">Jackson Cage,</a>&#8221; &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/04/04/roll-of-the-dice-shes-the-one/\">She&#8217;s the One</a>,&#8221; &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/11/20/cover-me-the-way-you-do-the-things-you-do/\">Apollo Medley</a>,&#8221; &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/10/03/roll-of-the-dice-racing-in-the-street/\">Racing in the Street</a>,&#8221; &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/11/21/roll-of-the-dice-the-rising/\">The Rising</a>&#8221; (that one was a shocking omission), &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/06/19/roll-of-the-dice-bobby-jean/\">Bobby Jean</a>,&#8221; <a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/03/18/cover-me-dirty-water/\">Dirty Water</a>,&#8221; and &#8220;Twist and Shout.&#8221; Plus, there were only 26 songs on the setlist, and Bruce played 30.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m glad I did both Fenway shows&#8211;even a standard Bruce set is worth catching. But 8/15/12 was the show that cemented it for me: never pass up the last show in a multi-night stand.</p>\n<p>Time to relive it once again.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>Mind.
