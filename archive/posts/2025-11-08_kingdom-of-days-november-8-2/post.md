**1996:** Bruce plays a very special acoustic show at a very special venue: his old elementary school, St. Rose of Lima. This isn’t his first time playing the school gym (that was back in his Castiles days), but it’s his first time back since then. Although this show is technically part of the Ghost of Tom Joad Tour, in reality it’s a very different performance. First of all, he isn’t solo: Patti and Soozie join him on several numbers. Secondly, the setlist is *very* different, with *nine* tour premieres. Bruce opens with a gorgeous, Soozie-accompanied “[The River](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/03/04/roll-of-the-dice-the-river/)” and closes with a world debut: “[Freehold](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/12/03/roll-of-the-dice-freehold/),” which Bruce wrote for the occasion. In between, there’s gem after gem: “[Two Hearts](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/05/28/roll-of-the-dice-two-hearts/)” and “[When You’re Alone](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/11/15/roll-of-the-dice-when-youre-alone/)” with Soozie and Patti, “[Open All Night](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/10/28/roll-of-the-dice-open-all-night/)” and “[Used Cars](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/06/13/roll-of-the-dice-used-cars/)” solo, an absolutely stunning “[Racing in the Street](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/10/03/roll-of-the-dice-racing-in-the-street/)” with Soozie, and more.

**2005:** Bruce is in Philadelphia, and you know what that means: fans attending Bruce’s solo acoustic show get their traditional surprise treat–this time the long-awaited return of “[Drive All Night,](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/02/27/roll-of-the-dice-drive-all-night/)” played for the first time in 24 years. (Watch that moment and other highlights below.) That’s not the only tour premiere: Bruce also opens the show with “[Born in the U.S.A.](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/09/21/roll-of-the-dice-born-in-the-u-s-a/)” — as a solo *harmonica* number. Not bad for a Night One!
