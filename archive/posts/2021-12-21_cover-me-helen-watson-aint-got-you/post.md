With her incredible voice and stylistic range, Helen Watson could probably cover almost any song in Bruce Springsteen’s catalog and bring something new to the table in the process.

But if you’d asked me which of Bruce’s songs I’d expect her to choose, “” would be way down on the list.

But cover it she did, on her 1999 album in an a capella fashion that honors the original while showcasing her amazing voice.

It’s a cool, soulful performance of a rarely covered, under-the-radar Springsteen original. The rest of the album is pretty great too, spanning a rock spectrum from soul to folk in Watson’s own style–it’s worth checking out.
