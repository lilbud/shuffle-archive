<p>Never officially released as a single, “I’m Bad, I’m Nationwide” is nevertheless considered to be one of ZZ Top’s greatest hits and certainly one of the strongest tracks on the band’s 1979 <em>Deguello</em> album.</p>

<p>I can’t speak to when Bruce discovered it, but if you frequented The Stone Pony in 1984, you were bound to hear him play “I’m Bad, I’m Nationwide” at some point.</p>
<p>He played it a few times with the house band, Cats on a Smooth Surface:</p>

<p>He played it with John Eddie and The Frontstreet Runners:</p>

<p>And he played it with La Bamba and The Hubcaps:</p>

<p>In fact, for most of the year, it seemed like the only band Bruce <em>wasn’t</em> playing it with was the E Street Band, which is pretty astounding considering that Bruce and the band were out on the road for much of 1984 on what was only their biggest tour ever.</p>
<p>But on September 15th, Bruce finally gave “I’m Bad, I’m Nationwide” its E Street debut at the Philadelphia Spectrum, where it served as the opening encore.</p>

<p>Fans who missed that debut performance had to wait a long time to hear the E Street Band tackle it again. Well, except for a lucky few, that is–three years later, in the summer of 1987, Bruce and the E Street Band made a couple of surprise appearances at The Stone Pony, where “I’m Bad, I’m Nationwide” was among the songs in their cover-filled sets.</p>

<p>But other than the pair of 1987 club performances, a full quarter-century would pass between that first 1984 E Street performance and the next time Bruce and the band would tackle it in concert.</p>
<p>On April 21, 2009, when a Boston fan brought a sign request to Bruce’s attention, Bruce took up the gauntlet.</p>
<p>“The band does not know this song!” Bruce proclaimed. “They never played this song!”</p>

<p>He was wrong, of course, but we can forgive him, right? How many of us would remember playing a song 22 years ago? And how many of us would nail it after that long like the E Street Band did above?</p>
<p>“Don’t try to stump the E Street Band, baby!”</p>
<p>Indeed.</p>
