<p>Bruce adapted classic literature in song long before “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/10/17/roll-of-the-dice-the-ghost-of-tom-joad/">The Ghost of Tom Joad.</a>”</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1968, nineteen-year-old Bruce Springsteen put pen to paper and wrote a song called “Mississippi,” featuring two friends drifting down the great river on a raft on a beautiful, lazy summer day. One of them was named Jim, and although the narrator never identifies himself, it’s not too difficult to figure out his name, too.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Sailing down the Mississippi</em><br/>
<em>Chewing on a piece of hay</em><br/>
<em>Just ain’t nothing like my river</em><br/>
<em>On such a beautiful day</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Brother Jim lying right beside me</em><br/>
<em>Everything’s feeling just fine</em><br/>
<em>‘Cause we’re as free as the river</em><br/>
<em>Faithful by each other’s side</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>The sun feels mighty good this morning</em><br/>
<em>Gonna be a good day I can see</em><br/>
<em>Its gentle rays are mighty warmin’</em><br/>
<em>Why don’t you come along with Jim and me</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Plenty of fish to make good eatin’</em><br/>
<em>Lots of room upon the raft</em><br/>
<em>Now that you’re friends with the river</em><br/>
<em>Maybe you’ll never go back</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Put down the load you been carrying</em><br/>
<em>Follow me and don’t look back</em><br/>
<em>Jim’s just about got supper cookin’</em><br/>
<em>Plenty of room upon the raft</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Forget about time for there’s no reason</em><br/>
<em>To worry about things like that</em><br/>
<em>The days just melt into seasons</em><br/>
<em>There is no future or past</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Summer sky is our roof top</em><br/>
<em>Travelin’ on just another mile</em><br/>
<em>Don’t think I’m ever gonna stop</em><br/>
<em>Can’t do nothing now but smile and smile</em></p>
<p>Bruce never recorded his adaptation of <em>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</em>, but he did include some margin notes (for example, “Instead of A minor use D”) that at least tell us he envisioned “Mississippi” as a song rather than a poem.</p>
