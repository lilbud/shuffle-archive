By the time the 2016 River Tour reached its last month, Bruce was continually raising the bar, breaking and setting new records for longest American show (his 2012 record-length show in Helsinki is still unmatched) with regularity.</p>\n<p>Even two years down the road, this show is tough one for me to characterize. On one hand, the Night 1/Night 2 rule was definitely in effect, with Bruce tracing what had now become his standard chronological arc through his catalog. Also,\u00a0<span class=\"text_exposed_show\">there wasn&#8217;t a single true sign request (the two signs he grabbed were for songs already on the setlist), a very rare instance of a Bruce show that closely resembles the original pre-show plan (there were audibles, however).</span></p>\n<div class=\"text_exposed_show\">\n<p>Still&#8211;and I continue to marvel every time I realize this&#8211;this &#8220;standard set&#8221; included &#8220;New York City Serenade,&#8221; &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/02/20/roll-of-the-dice-lost-in-the-flood/\">Lost in the Flood,</a>&#8221; &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/01/22/roll-of-the-dice-kittys-back/\">Kitty&#8217;s Back</a>,&#8221; &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/12/14/roll-of-the-dice-incident-on-57th-street/\">Incident on 57th Street</a>.&#8221; &#8220;Jungleland,&#8221; &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/09/24/roll-of-the-dice-thundercrack/\">Thundercrack</a>,&#8221; and &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/10/04/roll-of-the-dice-the-fever/\">The Fever</a>.&#8221; Most hardcore fans wish for just <em>one</em> of these songs to show up in their show. Some fans never get to seem at all. It&#8217;s absolutely freaking nuts that they all came out in one night&#8217;s set.</p>\n<p>And if it was no longer surprising to hear all of these gems in one show, the trade-off (and it was a good one) was that each and every performance was stronger for the repetition.</p>\n<p>I think we forget about that sometimes: how a tour&#8217;s setlist staples grow in power and beauty over the course of the tour, as the band becomes more familiar with them and adds nuance from night to night. We never really get to experience that with the &#8220;holy grail&#8221; songs, because they don&#8217;t come out often enough. We&#8217;re thankful just to hear them at all.</p>\n<p>But one of the absolute joys of this final leg of the 2016 tour was hearing &#8220;New York City Serenade&#8221; and &#8220;Kitty&#8217;s Back&#8221; night after night and noting how each performance became stronger and more sublime with each performance.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - &quot;New York City Serenade,&quot; Philadelphia 2016-09-07\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hatk8NgE2JU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen &amp; The E Street Band &quot;Lost In The Flood&quot; Live @ Citizens Bank Park\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aJW7C2o__gY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - &quot;Kitty&#039;s Back&quot; Philadelphia, 2016-09-07\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/E6C0IF8HKok?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>It was clear to me this show was going to set a record when I realized we were at the two-hour mark, and Bruce was only <em>twelve songs</em> in.
