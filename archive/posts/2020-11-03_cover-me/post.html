My memories of that time are very much alive. We came to Argentina when the country was going through a hard time and was struggling for a future. For a foreigner, Argentina was alive and promising, so it’s a big inspiration for me to be back. I want to dedicate this song to the people of Argentina.”  <em>–Bruce Springsteen, September 14, 2013</em></span></p></blockquote>
<p>With those words delivered in Spanish to his Argentinian fans, Bruce sang a tender, earnest cover of León Gieco’s 1978 protest song, “Sólo Le Pido A Dios.”</p>

<p>It was a one-time-only cover under unusual circumstances: Bruce had done his best to learn it in advance of his show in Buenos Aires, but at the last minute, he decided he hadn’t quite mastered it. Bruce admitted as much from the stage during his show that night, but he promised to film it and share it on the Internet instead.</p>
<p>It only took Bruce two days to honor his promise. On September 16, Bruce’s posted his video to his YouTube channel and official web site with a simple note:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>There is a song I planned to sing at our Buenos Aires concert that I learned from the wonderful Argentine singer, Mercedes Sosa. I wasn’t quite prepared that evening so I’m glad to send this out now to all of our friends and fans in Argentina.</em></p>
<p>“Sólo Le Pido A Dios” translates to “I only ask of God,” and it was originally recorded by  León Gieco (who once performed with Bruce at the final concert of the Human Rights Now! Tour in 1988) as the first song on his 1978 album, <em>IV LP</em>. Since then, it’s become Gieco’s standard closing song at his concerts.</p>

<p>Gieco’s lyrics are simple but powerful, beseeching his God for the strength to face and fight the forces of injustice, war, and social ills.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>I only ask God</em><br/>
<em>That I’m not indifferent to pain</em><br/>
<em>That dry death won’t find me</em><br/>
<em>Empty and alone</em><br/>
<em>Without having done enough.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>I only ask God</em><br/>
<em>That I’m not indifferent to war</em><br/>
<em>It’s a big monster</em><br/>
<em>And it tramples hard</em><br/>
<em>On the poor innocence of people.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>I only ask God</em><br/>
<em>That I’m not indifferent to injustice</em><br/>
<em>That I will not be slapped on the other cheek</em><br/>
<em>After a claw has torn me in this manner.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>I only ask God</em><br/>
<em>That I’m not indifferent to deceit</em><br/>
<em>If a traitor is mightier than a few</em><br/>
<em>Let those few not forget it easily.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>I only ask of God</em><br/>
<em>That I am not indifferent to the future,</em><br/>
<em>Hopeless is he who has to go</em><br/>
<em>To live a different culture.</em></p>
<p>“Sólo Le Pido A Dios” has been covered by dozens of artists (including the late Mercedes Sosa, who taught it to Bruce) and translated into more than twenty-five languages worldwide.</p>
<p>It remains as important today as it was when Gieco first recorded it.</p>
