My memories of that time are very much alive. We came to Argentina when the country was going through a hard time and was struggling for a future. For a foreigner, Argentina was alive and promising, so it&#8217;s a big inspiration for me to be back. I want to dedicate this song to the people of Argentina.&#8221;\u00a0 <em>&#8211;Bruce Springsteen, September 14, 2013</em></span></p></blockquote>\n<p>With those words delivered in Spanish to his Argentinian fans, Bruce sang a tender, earnest cover of Le\u00f3n Gieco&#8217;s 1978 protest song, &#8220;S\u00f3lo Le Pido A Dios.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - S\u00f3lo le Pido a Dios\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KqMszVPa6e4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>It was a one-time-only cover under unusual circumstances: Bruce had done his best to learn it in advance of his show in Buenos Aires, but at the last minute, he decided he hadn&#8217;t quite mastered it.\u00a0Bruce admitted as much from the stage during his show that night, but he promised to film it and share it on the Internet instead.</p>\n<p>It only took Bruce two days to honor his promise. On September 16, Bruce&#8217;s posted his video to his YouTube channel and official web site with a simple note:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>There is a song I planned to sing at our Buenos Aires concert that I learned from the wonderful Argentine singer,\u00a0Mercedes Sosa. I wasn\u2019t quite prepared that evening so I\u2019m glad to send this out now to all of our friends and fans in Argentina.</em></p>\n<p>&#8220;S\u00f3lo Le Pido A Dios&#8221; translates to &#8220;I only ask of God,&#8221; and it was originally recorded by \u00a0Le\u00f3n Gieco (who once performed with Bruce at the final concert of the Human Rights Now! Tour in 1988) as the first song on his 1978 album, <em>IV LP</em>. Since then, it&#8217;s become Gieco&#8217;s standard closing song at his concerts.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"S\u00f3lo le pido a dios - Le\u00f3n Gieco\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JqRiD6Phm2U?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer;
