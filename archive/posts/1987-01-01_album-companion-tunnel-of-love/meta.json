Have we made the right ones? What do we do when we realize we&#8217;ve made the wrong ones? What if we never know? What if we simply refuse to choose?</p>\n<p>Without exception, every song on <em>Tunnel of Love </em>concerns the consequences of choosing, written by a songwriter who&#8217;s reached the age where the enduring impact of his decisions can no longer be ignored.</p>\n<p>&#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/07/21/roll-of-the-dice-walk-like-a-man/\">Walk Like a Man</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/01/08/roll-of-the-dice-spare-parts/\">Spare Parts</a>&#8221; were the first songs recorded for the album in January 1987. The former takes place at the moment of one of life&#8217;s great choices, as a groom looks to his father for guidance as he commits to his bride. The latter introduces us to an unwed mother contemplating a terrible decision as she yearns to escape the lasting consequences of a moment of passion.</p>\n<p>Over the weeks and months that followed, Bruce recorded song after song, all in <em>Nebraska </em>fashion at home by himself. (He&#8217;d eventually ask his bandmates to contribute overdubs to fill out the tracks.)</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen: Inside Tunnel of Love on VH1 1988\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ms1q_1m69ng?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>At first, the songs featured optimism, or at least acceptance.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/08/05/roll-of-the-dice-all-that-heaven-will-allow/\">All That Heaven Will Allow</a>&#8221; &#8212; the classic romance film homage about a working-class Ron who goes all in for his upper-class Cary</li>\n<li>&#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/06/12/roll-of-the-dice-valentines-day/\">Valentine&#8217;s Day</a>&#8221; &#8212; the tale of a man who finally finds the strength and motivation to overcome his fear of commitment</li>\n<li>&#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/08/30/roll-of-the-dice-aint-got-you/\">Ain&#8217;t Got You</a>&#8221; &#8212; a Billy Boy Arnold tribute by a self-mocking songwriter who realizes he&#8217;s committed to the wrong person</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As the sessions stretched on toward April, however, Bruce&#8217;s songs took on more shading.

The album itself went to #1 in the U.S. and the U.K. and was eventually certified triple platinum.</p>\n<p>Critics noted, however, the relative absence of the E Street Band and the dark turn for a newly married man, both of which proved to be foreshadowing.</p>\n<p>In the 35 years since its release,\u00a0<em>Tunnel of Love\u00a0</em>holds up as one of Springsteen&#8217;s very best albums. Although its dated production detracts a bit when listening to the original studio recordings, the songs themselves represent some of Bruce&#8217;s best songwriting and remain fan favorites to this day. They also remain among the rarest to grace his setlists&#8211;only &#8220;Brilliant Disguise&#8221; and &#8220;Tougher Than the Rest&#8221; get anything resembling regular appearances.</p>\n<p>Bruce would continue to write about love and relationships in the years ahead, but rarely would he do so with such stark emotional honesty as he did on\u00a0<em>Tunnel of Love</em>.
