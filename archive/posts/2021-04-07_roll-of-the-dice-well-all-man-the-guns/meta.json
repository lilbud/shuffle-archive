This is a song called &#8216;All Man the Guns&#8217; and it&#8217;s about a guy heading off to war&#8230; and he&#8217;s talking to his girl and saying &#8216;wait for me cause I&#8217;ll be back, you know, and everything will be fine.&#8217; And they never do!'&#8221;&nbsp; </span><span style=\"font-size: 14pt\"><em>&#8211;Bruce Springsteen, August 14, 1970</em></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If there was ever an early Springsteen song that we&nbsp;<em>don&#8217;t</em> need an explanation for, it&#8217;s &#8220;We&#8217;ll All Man the Guns&#8221; (also known as &#8220;All Man the Guns&#8221;). Or do we?</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll All Man the Guns&#8221; seems as straightforward as early Springsteen originals get. Set in the midst of the Vietnam War, Bruce&#8217;s narrator is a soldier facing the horrors of war and sustained by the thought of his love (Mary, of course&#8211;even at age 20, Bruce&#8217;s love interests were named Mary) waiting for him to return home.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s only one documented performance of &#8220;We&#8217;ll All Man the Guns,&#8221; and judging from Bruce&#8217;s introductory explanation, it might have been the very first time he&#8217;d played it.</p>\n<p>Take a listen to that Steel Mill performance below. I know it&#8217;s a distant recording, but Bruce&#8217;s vocals (and even his patter with the band) are remarkably clear&#8211;there&#8217;s not a single line we can&#8217;t make out.</p>\n<div id=\"v-BaRLFbs9-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='568' src='https://videopress.com/embed/BaRLFbs9?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>Bruce kind of spoils the song in the introduction, doesn&#8217;t he?</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s never any indication in the song that Mary isn&#8217;t faithfully waiting for her soldier to return home, but Bruce&#8217;s cynical explanation (&#8220;And they never do!&#8221;) supported by a Greek chorus of jeers (and a snide &#8220;Dear John&#8230;&#8221;) imply that Bruce and the boys view their protagonist as na\u00efve and foolish for believing his girl will wait for him.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px\"><em>And we&#8217;ll all man the guns for America</em><br />\n<em>And we&#8217;ll all run the enemy home</em><br />\n<em>And we&#8217;ll all man the guns for America</em><br />\n<em>Just be there when I get home</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px\"><em>Come to me Mary, oh I wanna know</em><br />\n<em>If you still love me, like you told me so</em><br />\n<em>Meet me by the river</em><br />\n<em>Meet me in the field</em><br />\n<em>Underneath that old oak tree</em><br />\n<em>Oh won&#8217;t you say you will</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px\"><em>When the rooster crows</em><br />\n<em>And the train whistle blows</em><br />\n<em>That&#8217;s when I&#8217;ll be gone</em><br />\n<em>You see I got a job to do</em><br />\n<em>My country is at war</em><br />\n<em>But I&#8217;d fight the fiercest battle</em><br />\n<em>And I&#8217;d cross the roughest land</em><br />\n<em>If only I could be sure</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;d have my Mary&#8217;s hand</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px\"><em>And we&#8217;ll all man the guns for America</em><br />\n<em>And we&#8217;ll all run the enemy home</em><br />\n<em>And we&#8217;ll all man the guns for America</em><br />\n<em>The sooner it&#8217;s done</em><br />\n<em>The sooner we&#8217;ve won</em><br />\n<em>The sooner I&#8217;ll be home</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px\"><em>In my dreams I hear the cannon</em><br />\n<em>Thundering in the night</em><br />\n<em>But sometimes I wake up screaming</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;ve soaked my bed in fright</em><br />\n<em>We&#8217;ll tomorrow I&#8217;ll be leaving</em><br />\n<em>And I might never come back again</em><br />\n<em>You know I said that I will</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;m a God-fearing patriotic man</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px\"><em>Won&#8217;t you meet me &#8216;neath that old oak tree</em><br />\n<em>Fast as I can</em><br />\n<em>You see I&#8217;ve got my duty to do</em><br />\n<em>As a God-fearing patriotic man</em><br />\n<em>But I&#8217;d fight the fiercest battle</em><br />\n<em>And I&#8217;d walk the roughest land</em><br />\n<em>If only I could be sure</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;d have Mary&#8217;s hand</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px\"><em>And we&#8217;ll all man the guns for America</em><br />\n<em>And we&#8217;ll all run the enemy home</em><br />\n<em>And we&#8217;ll all man the guns for America</em><br />\n<em>The sooner it&#8217;s done, the sooner we&#8217;ve won, the sooner I&#8217;ll get home</em></p>\n<p>Still&#8230; it&#8217;s hard to hear those lyrics and not wonder if Bruce hadn&#8217;t also intended Mary to be a stand-in for America itself.
