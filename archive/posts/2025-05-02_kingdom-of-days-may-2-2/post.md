**1970:** Steel Mill attempts to crash a three-day music festival at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill–not to attend, but to play! Bruce and the band sneak past security and set up their gear. They are caught and ejected just before they are about to start playing. All is not lost, however, since they have a scheduled gig at the Hullaballoo in Richmond that evening, just a few hours drive away.

**1972:** A watershed day for Bruce: Mike Appel arranges a meeting and audition for Bruce with John Hammond at Hammond’s Columbia Records office in New York City. By the time Bruce finishes playing “[It’s Hard to Be a Saint in the City](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/10/21/roll-of-the-dice-its-hard-to-be-a-saint-in-the-city/),” Hammond knows he wants to sign Bruce.

Bruce plays three more songs (including “[If I Was the Priest](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/12/28/roll-of-the-dice-if-i-was-the-priest/)“), and then Hammond asks how Bruce is with a live audience. Mike Appel immediately arranges a gig at the Gaslight Au Go Go for early that evening, opening for Garland Jeffreys and Charlie Musselwhite. Satisfied with the performance, Hammond invites Bruce to come down the next day to make a demo.

**1974:** The *Camden Courier-Post* publishes a long, revealing profile of and interview with Bruce.
