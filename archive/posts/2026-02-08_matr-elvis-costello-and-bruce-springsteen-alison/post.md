“I’ve always told people that I wrote the song ‘Alison’ after seeing a beautiful checkout girl at the local supermarket. She had a face for which a ship might have once been named. Scoundrels might once have fought mist-swathed duels to defend her honour. Now she was punching in the prices on cans of beans at a cash register and looking as if all the hopes and dreams of her youth were draining away.” — Elvis Costello, *Unfaithful Music & Disappearing Ink*

With apologies to Bruce: the true Queen of the Supermarket belongs to Elvis.

Elvis Costello released “Alison” as the second single from his very first album in 1977. The tender ballad never made the charts, but it became a signature song for Elvis and one of his most beloved.

In the winter of 2001, Bruce reprised his successful Asbury Park benefit holiday shows from the previous year, expanding them from a pair to a string of five shows over the course of a week. Every show featured a set list full of holiday classics, Springsteen chestnuts, and eclectic surprises.

The run culminated in a star-studded final show that featured appearances by Bruce Hornsby and Elvis Costello in addition to the “regular” cast over the course of the week.

Elvis only joined Bruce for two brief numbers, one of which was a cover. The other one, however, was “Alison,” and Costello’s lovely acoustic rendition–with Bruce on backing vocals–was one of the highlights of the night.

(Apologies for the abrupt ending; Elvis segued into “The Tracks of My Tears” from there.)

Despite a few additional appearances together (most notably on Elvis’ late, lamented series), this was the only time Bruce has ever performed “Alison” live.
