It&#8217;s hard to keep track of all of the many different versions that Bruce has performed&#8211;some subtle, some bold&#8211;but I can&#8217;t think of a single clunker among them.</p>\n<p>Bruce wrote &#8220;If I Should Fall Behind&#8221; as a wedding song, not just in its lyrics but also as a songwriting exercise: he wrote it while preparing to marry Patti, and he first performed it at their wedding in 1991. The following year, he gifted his song to the world as the third single on his underrated\u00a0<em>Lucky Town</em> album.</p>\n<p>Except for Gary Mallaber&#8217;s drums, Bruce plays every instrument on the track. Even if you&#8217;re intimately familiar with this song, it&#8217;s worth another close listen just to marvel at the care Bruce takes with his delicate guitar work.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"If I Should Fall Behind\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qKOjKKj_TPo?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>What makes this song so enduringly endearing to fans is its recognition that (in the words of another great Springsteen song) it&#8217;s easy for two people to lose each other in this tunnel of love.</p>\n<p>(In fact, &#8220;If I Should Fall Behind&#8221; serves as a great sequel to &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/06/15/roll-of-the-dice-tunnel-of-love/\">Tunnel of Love</a>.&#8221; It&#8217;s very easy to imagine that the same narrator sings both songs&#8211;&#8220;Tunnel of Love&#8221; at the beginning of a relationship and &#8220;If I Should Fall Behind&#8221; at their wedding.)</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>We said we&#8217;d walk together, baby, come what may</em><br />\n<em>That come the twilight should we lose our way</em><br />\n<em>If as we&#8217;re walking a hand should slip free</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;ll wait for you, should I fall behind wait for me</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>We swore we&#8217;d travel, darling, side by side</em><br />\n<em>We&#8217;d help each other stay in stride</em><br />\n<em>But each lover&#8217;s steps fall so differently</em><br />\n<em>But I&#8217;ll wait for you, and if I should fall behind wait for me</em></p>\n<p>These first two verses establish and recognize a near-universal truth: that no matter how much in sync we may be with our chosen life companion in the beginning, that synchrony is almost impossible to maintain over years and decades without interruption.</p>\n<p>The twilight in the song represents years advancing, and as we go through life together, we grow closer in some ways and independently in others. Sometimes we focus more on ourselves, sometimes on our jobs, or our families. Sometimes we lose our connection to each other and let our hands slip free.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Now everyone dreams of love lasting and true</em><br />\n<em>Oh but you and I know what this world can do</em><br />\n<em>So let&#8217;s make our steps clear that the other may see</em><br />\n<em>And I&#8217;ll wait for you, and if I should fall behind wait for me</em></p>\n<p>The narrator of this song&#8211;and although I always to separate the writer from the character, it&#8217;s almost impossible to do so in this case&#8211;doesn&#8217;t try to promise otherwise. In fact, he pretty much predicts the bumps in the road ahead. He knows they&#8217;re coming, in fact, because he&#8217;s already done some walking down his that road alone: Bruce has revealed that the narrator &#8220;If I Should Fall Behind&#8221; may be the same man who sang &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/04/10/roll-of-the-dice-darkness-on-the-edge-of-town/\">Darkness on the Edge of Town</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"v-3NLub5G0-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='426' src='https://videopress.com/embed/3NLub5G0?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>But he promises that when he realizes that they&#8217;ve drifted apart, he&#8217;ll stop and wait. And he asks his love to do the same for him.</p>\n<p>And that&#8217;s about as much as we can ever ask of anyone.</p>\n<p>In the final verse, the lovers&#8217; wedding is nigh, and the imagery that makes for such a beautiful setting literally foreshadow the challenges that lie in store:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Now there&#8217;s a beautiful river in the valley ahead</em><br />\n<em>There &#8216;neath the oak&#8217;s bough soon we will be wed</em><br />\n<em>Should we lose each other in the shadow of the evening trees</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;ll wait for you, should I fall behind wait for me</em><br />\n<em>Darling, I&#8217;ll wait for you, and should I fall behind wait for me</em></p>\n<p>There&#8217;s no stronger wedding vow than that.</p>\n<p>But there are other bonds in this life besides those between husband and wife, and &#8220;If I Should Fall Behind&#8221; pays tribute to them, too.</p>\n<p>In 1999, Bruce reunited the E Street Band after a decade apart. It was a decade of necessary personal and professional growth and exploration for Bruce, but he ultimately recognized the ties that bound him to his bandmates and that bound his band to his audience.</p>\n<p>And so when Bruce constructed the story arc for the tour setlist, he immediately without exception ensured that one of the closing numbers of every show would be &#8220;If I Should Fall Behind,&#8221; a kind of love letter, apology, and promise to his bandmates and to his fans&#8211;each and every night.</p>\n<p>To ensure that the message wasn&#8217;t missed, Bruce re-arranged the song to showcase the band members individually. He kept the instrumentation spare (except for Clarence&#8217;s sax solo, which says as much as any lyrics could), gave the song room to breathe, and capped it off with a closing line in gorgeous full-band harmony. The result is (IMHO) the definitive arrangement of the song.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - If I Should Fall Behind (Official HD Video)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RmUG1ffgKFw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>But Bruce would still tinker with the song over the years, usually in small ways, but sometimes dramatically.
