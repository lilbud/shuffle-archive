Bruce often turns up when his lifelong friend performs locally.</p>\n<p>They probably weren&#8217;t shocked by the song selection, either: Bruce and Steve have performed &#8220;It&#8217;s Been a Long Time&#8221; and &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/03/30/meeting-across-the-river-bruce-springsteen-and-steve-van-zandt-i-dont-want-to-go-home/\">I Don&#8217;t Want to Go Home</a>&#8221; together many times, and &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/11/19/roll-of-the-dice-tenth-avenue-freeze-out/\">Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out</a>&#8221; too may times to count.</p>\n<p>But the show&#8217;s encore&#8211;now\u00a0<em>that</em> was different.</p>\n<p>Bruce played Marvin Gaye&#8217;s &#8220;Can I Get a Witness&#8221; once before, a decade earlier at a private benefit concert. However, no recording circulates from that performance.</p>\n<p>Gaye&#8217;s original only peaked at #22 on the Billboard Hot 100, but it lasted sixteen weeks on the chart, making it one of Gaye&#8217;s longest-lasting hits if not his most popular.
