<p>When I started this blog, I promised to make my way through Bruce’s entire catalog–released and unreleased–and give each song due consideration and analysis.</p>
<p>But I’m sorry: I simply cannot make it through a single listen of “Mary Louise Watson” — a bluesy unreleased Springsteen original from his Steel Mill days — without recalling this classic (and probably NSFW, so be forewarned) scene from <em>Weird Science:</em></p>

<p>I mean, come on. Listen to Bruce’s early 1971 performance below, and especially when you get to the spoken-word mid-song break, tell me you aren’t picturing Anthony Michael Hall with Bruce’s voice.</p>

<p>Often when I listen to one of Bruce’s 1971 recordings, I have to remind myself that he was only 21 years old at the time. Other times–like this one–it’s painfully obvious.</p>
<p>So I’m gonna forgo the lyrical analysis this time. I’m pretty sure the song speaks for itself.</p>
<p>To his credit, by the end of that same year, Bruce had dramatically reworked the song into more of a straightforward rocker, and he’d pared back and streamlined the lyrics, removing all references to “Heavy” Louise and comparing her instead to a black widow spider (this version is sometimes referred to by that title, in fact).</p>
<p>The sound quality isn’t great, but here’s the only other known instance of “Mary Louise Watson/Black Widow Spider” from mid-December 1971, this time performed by The Bruce Springsteen Band.</p>

<p>While the earlier version might play to ears today as a novelty song, from a historical perspective it offers us insight into a very young Bruce still developing his stage presence and patter.</p>
