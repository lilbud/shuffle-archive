Just like Bruce, Pickett kept just the title/refrain and changed everything else.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Ninety-Nine And A Half Won&#039;t Do\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/A0iK-kMCFms?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>So there&#8217;s a nice bit of historical rhyming in the way Bruce chose to cover &#8220;Ninety-Nine and a Half (Won&#8217;t Do).&#8221;</p>\n<p>It was never much more than a lark, though, destined for one-off status from the start.</p>\n<p>Or two-off, I suppose, to be accurate. That clip above is the one most fans have heard, from Bruce&#8217;s Meadowlands show in the summer of 1992. Bruce covered it one additional time, though, just seven weeks earlier. That performance is harder to come by (and a lot harder to make out), but you can listen to it here.</p>\n<div id=\"v-ApN9htUF-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='568' src='https://videopress.com/embed/ApN9htUF?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p><strong>Ninety-Nine and a Half (Won&#8217;t Do)<br />\nFirst performed:</strong> June 5, 1992 (Los Angeles, CA)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> July 25, 1992 (East Rutherford, NJ)</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>Twice only: Bruce paid tribute to Wilson Pickett with his own version of &#8220;Ninety-Nine and a Half (Won&#8217;t Do).&#8221; Just don&#8217;t call it a cover.</p>\n", "protected": false}, "author": 1, "featured_media": 21827, "comment_status": "open", "ping_status": "open", "sticky": false, "template": "", "format": "standard", "meta": {"_monsterinsights_skip_tracking": false, "_monsterinsights_sitenote_active": false, "_monsterinsights_sitenote_note": "", "_monsterinsights_sitenote_category": 0, "jetpack_post_was_ever_published": false, "_jetpack_newsletter_access": "", "_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs": false, "_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id": 0, "_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content": false, "_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content": false, "footnotes": "", "jetpack_publicize_message": "", "jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled": true, "jetpack_social_post_already_shared": true, "jetpack_social_options": {"image_generator_settings": {"template": "highway", "default_image_id": 0, "font": "", "enabled": false}, "version": 2}}, "categories": [4], "tags": [2920, 530], "class_list": ["post-21637", "post", "type-post", "status-publish", "format-standard", "has-post-thumbnail", "hentry", "category-cover-me", "tag-ninety-nine-and-a-half-wont-do", "tag-wilson-pickett"], "aioseo_notices": [], "jetpack_publicize_connections": [], "jetpack_featured_media_url": "https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/99andahalf.jpg?fit=1280%2C720&ssl=1", "jetpack_sharing_enabled": true, "jetpack_shortlink": "https://wp.me/p9w3Lk-5CZ", "jetpack_likes_enabled": true, "jetpack-related-posts": [{"id": 20933, "url": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/12/31/matr-wilson-pickett-and-bruce-springsteen-in-the-midnight-hour/", "url_meta": {"origin": 21637, "position": 0}, "title": "MatR: Wilson Pickett and Bruce Springsteen: In the Midnight Hour", "author": "Ken", "date": "December 31, 2020", "format": false, "excerpt": "One time only: Bruce joins forces with the legendary Wilson Pickett on Pickett's iconic hit, \"In the Midnight Hour.\"", "rel": "", "context": "In &quot;Cover Me&quot;", "block_context": {"text": "Cover Me", "link": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/category/cover-me/"}, "img": {"alt_text": "", "src": "https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/midnight.jpg?fit=600%2C604&ssl=1&resize=350%2C200", "width": 350, "height": 200, "srcset": "https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/midnight.jpg?fit=600%2C604&ssl=1&resize=350%2C200 1x, https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/midnight.jpg?fit=600%2C604&ssl=1&resize=525%2C300 1.5x"}, "classes": []}, {"id": 13620, "url": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/10/28/matr-bruce-springsteen-and-the-shots-funky-broadway/", "url_meta": {"origin": 21637, "position": 1}, "title": "MatR: Bruce Springsteen and The Shots: Funky Broadway", "author": "Ken", "date": "October 28, 2019", "format": false, "excerpt": "One time only: Bruce joins short-lived Stone Pony house band The Shots for a cover of Wilson Pickett's hit, \"Funky Broadway.\"", "rel": "", "context": "In &quot;Cover Me&quot;", "block_context": {"text": "Cover Me", "link": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/category/cover-me/"}, "img": {"alt_text": "", "src": "https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/funky.jpg?fit=500%2C500&ssl=1&resize=350%2C200", "width": 350, "height": 200}, "classes": []}, {"id": 3488, "url": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/08/14/cover-me-634-5789-soulsville-u-s-a/", "url_meta": {"origin": 21637, "position": 2}, "title": "Cover Me: 634-5789 (Soulsville, U.S.A.)", "author": "Ken", "date": "August 14, 2018", "format": false, "excerpt": "Whenever Bruce goes to Soulsville, U.S.A., there's gonna be a party.
