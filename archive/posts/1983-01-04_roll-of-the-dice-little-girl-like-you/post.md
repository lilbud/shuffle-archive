For every great song Bruce has released over the years, there’s at least one great outtake that never saw the light of day.

“Little Girl Like You” isn’t one of them.

You might argue that as a home demo recording from the *Born in the U.S.A.* sessions, it’s unfair to judge what the song might have become, and you might have a point.

Except, of course, that Bruce *did* finally release it decades later on *L.A. Garage Sessions ’83*, so it is now official Springsteen canon. With its rushed, overly simplistic melody and shallow, unimaginative lyrics, I’d argue this song would be lost on any album it appeared on.

But perhaps that ‘s not the only reason why Bruce hid it away for so long.

Although it might shock today with the benefit of knowing Bruce’s full body of work and politics, back in the early 1980s, Bruce had come under fire by the National Organization for Women as a sexist artist.

The primary complaint? Bruce’s penchant for labelling his female characters “little girls.”

“When you call us ‘little girls,’ read the letter that kicked off a mail-and-phone protest campaign, “you perpetuate the myth that women do things in a ‘small’ way.”

When called for comment, Bruce’s spokesperson defended the phrase (remember this was 45 years ago), calling it a common rock-and-roll term. But we can’t help but notice Bruce’s “little girl” references quickly and quietly faded.

So a song called “Little Girl Like You”… let’s just say that including this song on *Born in the U.S.A.* might have been like throwing a match in the proverbial powder keg.

Check out the lyrics:

*I want a little house, on a little hill*  
*I wanna settle down, yeah I think I will*  
*Settle down and find a little love that’s true*  
*Settle down with a girl like you*

*Seen a lot of girls, h**ad a lot of fun*  
*Ran around a lot, n**ow my runnin’s done*  
*Honey, all I want, w**anna be runnin’ to*  
*Is the arms of a girl like you*

*You start living life l**ike you just don’t care*  
*You done everything, yo**u been everywhere*  
*But what I done ain’t nothin’ t**o what I wanna do*  
*When I find a little girl like you*

*We’ll get married i**n a church down a winding path*   
*Tell a lot of jokes, h**ave a lot of laughs*  
*Do whatever it is that we wannna do*  
*Long as I do it with a girl like you*

*Hey little stranger, w**alkin’ down the street*  
*You’re the only one can* *make my life complete*  
*I got a plan but i**t’s made for two*  
*So I need a little girl like you*  
*Yeah hey, I need a little girl like you*  
*Oh honey I need a little girl like you  
Oh baby I need a little girl like you*  


It’s not just the repeated “little girl” phrasing that’s problematic. It’s the context of a song about a guy who seems more interested in having someone *like* you rather than you in particular. Or more pointedly, he seems more interested in companionship than in a companion.

It’s explicitly clear in the last verse that our narrator is addressing a stranger, and in the earlier verses it’s clear that he’s got quite the hookup history and has his mind set on another.

In 1983, these lyrics were offensive. Today, they’re also creepy.

So, yeah: this is a lost track that probably should have stayed lost.
