But we can&#8217;t help but notice Bruce&#8217;s &#8220;little girl&#8221; references quickly and quietly faded.</p>\n<p>So a song called &#8220;Little Girl Like You&#8221;&#8230; let&#8217;s just say that including this song on <em>Born in the U.S.A. </em>might have been like throwing a match in the proverbial powder keg.</p>\n<p>Check out the lyrics:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>I want a little house, on a little hill</em><br />\n<em>I wanna settle down, yeah I think I will</em><br />\n<em>Settle down and find a little love that&#8217;s true</em><br />\n<em>Settle down with a girl like you</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Seen a lot of girls, h</em><em>ad a lot of fun</em><br />\n<em>Ran around a lot, n</em><em>ow my runnin&#8217;s done</em><br />\n<em>Honey, all I want, w</em><em>anna be runnin&#8217; to</em><br />\n<em>Is the arms of a girl like you</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>You start living life l</em><em>ike you just don&#8217;t care</em><br />\n<em>You done everything, yo</em><em>u been everywhere</em><br />\n<em>But what I done ain&#8217;t nothin&#8217; t</em><em>o what I wanna do</em><br />\n<em>When I find a little girl like you</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>We&#8217;ll get married i</em><em>n a church down a winding path\u00a0</em><br />\n<em>Tell a lot of jokes, h</em><em>ave a lot of laughs</em><br />\n<em>Do whatever it is that we wannna do</em><br />\n<em>Long as I do it with a girl like you</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Hey little stranger, w</em><em>alkin&#8217; down the street</em><br />\n<em>You&#8217;re the only one can </em><em>make my life complete</em><br />\n<em>I got a plan but i</em><em>t&#8217;s made for two</em><br />\n<em>So I need a little girl like you</em><br />\n<em>Yeah hey, I need a little girl like you</em><br />\n<em>Oh honey I need a little girl like you<br />\nOh baby I need a little girl like you<br />\n</em></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not just the repeated &#8220;little girl&#8221; phrasing that&#8217;s problematic. It&#8217;s the context of a song about a guy who seems more interested in having someone <em>like</em> you rather than you in particular. Or more pointedly, he seems more interested in companionship than in a companion.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s explicitly clear in the last verse that our narrator is addressing a stranger, and in the earlier verses it&#8217;s clear that he&#8217;s got quite the hookup history and has his mind set on another.</p>\n<p>In 1983, these lyrics were offensive. Today, they&#8217;re also creepy.</p>\n<p>So, yeah: this is a lost track that probably should have stayed lost.</p>\n<p><strong>Little Girl Like You</strong><br />\n<strong>Recorded:</strong> January 20, 1983<br />\n<strong>Released:\u00a0</strong><em>L.A.
