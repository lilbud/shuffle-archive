No, and it certainly won&#8217;t rank amongst his most popular work either.</p>\n<p>But if we&#8217;re looking for a three minute distillation of what Bruce has been trying to tell us since the beginning, we&#8217;ll find it in &#8220;The Power of Prayer.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - The Power Of Prayer (Official Lyric Video)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rZp8csyUi6w?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Despite its title, &#8220;The Power of Prayer&#8221; isn&#8217;t a religious song&#8211;it&#8217;s a spiritual one, and there&#8217;s a difference. This is a song about the transcendent power of music, its ability to touch our soul, connect our hearts, ignite our passions, and reveal our spirit.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As I\u2019ve gotten older, I\u2019ve kind of become a spiritual songwriter just by nature, by the things I\u2019ve grown interested in,&#8221; Bruce told\u00a0<em>The New York Times</em> last year. &#8220;At the end of the day I\u2019m writing about my own spiritual life, and I\u2019m addressing yours. We make a lot of music that addresses the soul, that\u2019s the nature of our band. Whether I heard, as I say on the record, Ben E. King\u2019s voice, or The Drifters, some of the otherworldly doo-wop of the early \u201960s \u2014 I just find a great essence of spirit in them. It was something that I wanted to communicate when I wrote my own music. It\u2019s not sort of dogmatic or overblown, there\u2019s no religion in it. There\u2019s just spirit, I hope.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Bruce may have grown more intentional about it as he&#8217;s aged, but he&#8217;s been showing us that there&#8217;s spirit in his music since his very first album. Can you feel it?</p>\n<p>Bruce constructed &#8220;The Power of Prayer&#8221; in the mold of the songs he sings about. It&#8217;s a three-and-a-half minute nostalgic callback to the R&amp;B singles of the sixties, with lyrical subtlety that&#8217;s offset by an E Street Band performance dripping with emotion from the nostalgic opening bars of Roy Bittan&#8217;s piano intro to the caution-thrown-to-wind bridge to that tender final verse.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The Power of Prayer&#8221; boasts the strongest arrangement on <a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2023/07/10/album-companion-letter-to-you/\"><i>Letter to You </i></a>and one of Bruce&#8217;s best in recent years. It allows him to take an understated approach with his lyrics, trusting that the music will inform us about what the song is truly about.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Dreamy afternoon &#8216;neath the summer sun</em><br />\n<em>We&#8217;d lie by the lake till the evening comes</em><br />\n<em>I run my fingers through your sun-streaked hair</em><br />\n<em>Baby that&#8217;s the power of prayer</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Summer nights, summer&#8217;s in the air</em><br />\n<em>I stack the tables with the chairs</em><br />\n<em>It&#8217;s closing time and you&#8217;re standing there</em><br />\n<em>Baby that&#8217;s the power of prayer</em></p>\n<p>At no point in those first two verses does Bruce tell us what he&#8217;s referring to as the power of prayer. It&#8217;s not until the final verse that he explicitly connects the dots, but we still sense it at first listen.</p>\n<p>The narrator and his love interest lie by the lake\u00a0<em>listening to music,\u00a0</em>and it&#8217;s that soundtrack that makes that moment indelible in his memory. He closes up the bar where he works as the radio plays in the background, and it&#8217;s that song that heightens and preserves that moment.</p>\n<p>We all have those magic moments, scenes we can recall vividly decades later, and always with a soundtrack. That&#8217;s the power of prayer.</p>\n<p>The bridge&#8211;both sides of it&#8211;spurs the narrator to go all in on love, with a clever card game metaphor (holding hearts, playing pairs). Bruce is paying homage to the romantic pop songs of his youth, but there&#8217;s a subtext at work as well:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>It&#8217;s a fixed game without any rules</em><br />\n<em>An empty table on a ship of fools</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;m holding hearts, I play the pair</em><br />\n<em>Darling it&#8217;s just the power of prayer</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>It&#8217;s a fixed game without any rules</em><br />\n<em>An empty table on a ship of fools</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;m holding hearts, I play the pair</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;m going all in &#8217;cause I don&#8217;t care</em><br />\n<em>They say that love, love comes and goes</em><br />\n<em>But darling what, what do they know</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;m reaching for heaven, we&#8217;ll make it there</em><br />\n<em>Darling it&#8217;s just the power of prayer</em><br />\n<em>Baby it&#8217;s just the power of prayer</em><br />\n<em>Darling it&#8217;s just the power of prayer</em></p>\n<p>That passage works equally well as the songwriter&#8217;s manifesto as it does the narrator&#8217;s love letter.</p>\n<p>The final verse is the reveal, and Bruce&#8217;s choice of songs is a deliberate wink.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Last call, the bouncer shuts the door</em><br />\n<em>&#8220;This Magic Moment&#8221; drifts across the floor</em><br />\n<em>As Ben E. King&#8217;s voice fills the air</em><br />\n<em>Baby that&#8217;s the power of prayer</em></p>\n<p>Music can elevate even the most prosaic of moments into the realm of magic. Is there anything else in life with that kind of power?</p>\n<p>The Oxford Dictionary defines <em>spirit</em> as &#8220;the nonphysical part of a person which is the seat of emotions and character; the soul.&#8221; Great songwriters imbue their work with their emotions and character, and when we hear it and recognize it, their spirit connects with our own. There&#8217;s no method of communication or communion more powerful.</p>\n<p>Bruce figured that out early on, and that&#8217;s why we connect to his music on such a deep, visceral level.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The Power of Prayer&#8221; may never be one of the songs Bruce is remembered for (except for in Italy, perhaps, where the song went to #1 and still receives frequent radio airplay), but the power of prayer is the reason why we&#8217;ll remember him at all.</p>\n<p><strong>Update 1/1/2024:\u00a0</strong>Bruce finally debuted &#8220;The Power of Prayer&#8221; at Stand Up For Heroes last November. Here&#8217;s that debut performance.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Power of Prayer @brucespringsteen\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/otO5hkhocZE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><strong>The Power of Prayer<br />\nRecorded:</strong> November 2019<br />\n<strong>Released:</strong>\u00a0<em>Letter to You\u00a0</em>(2020)<br />\n<strong>First performed: </strong>November 6, 2023(New York City, NY)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> November 6, 2023 (New York City, NY)</p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
