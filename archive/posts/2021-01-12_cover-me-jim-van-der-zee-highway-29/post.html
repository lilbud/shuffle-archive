<p>In 2018, the Dutch singer-songwriter was the winning contestant on <em>The Voice of Holland</em>, and with the record deal he won from that competition, he released his debut album, <em>Where I Come From.</em></p>
<p><em>Where I Come From </em> is a cover album, featuring ten songs by van der Zee’s musical heroes, including a wonderful cover of Bruce Springsteen’s “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/03/23/roll-of-the-dice-highway-29/">Highway 29</a>.”</p>

<p>Not only are van der Zee’s vocals terrific (we’d expect as much given his performance on <em>The Voice</em>), but the arrangement is superb as well. “Highway 29” is a quiet, contemplative song; van der Zee preserves its spirit while adorning it with restrained orchestration that never overpowers the lyrics.</p>
<p>But as is so often the case with the original artist, it’s when van der Zee performs the song in concert that he truly captivates. In this 2019 performance, Jim is accompanied only by piano and his own guitar, and it’s even better than his studio version.</p>
