<p>I’m pleased to announce a new feature of the site–one that several of you have written me to request:</p>
<p>We now have an <a href="http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/roll-of-the-dice-album-by-album/">Album-by-Album Index</a> for the <em>Roll of the Dice</em> series, added to our top menu.</p>

<p>It’s always been a challenge to keep this site constantly updated with new content every day; now that I’m 387 days in, I realize it’s also a challenge to sift through past articles.</p>
<p>Even though our search feature works extremely well, sometimes you just want to browse and find a favorite song from a favorite album.</p>
<p>Now you can! The index has all of Bruce’s original songs, album by album, with entries at the bottom for unreleased songs as well. If the song title is hyperlinked, I’ve written about it. If it isn’t it’s still on my very long to-do list. The index will be updated daily as new articles are posted. (It may lag by a couple of hours depending on whether I slept in that morning, but not by more than that.)</p>
<p>For now, the index only covers the <em>Roll of the Dice</em> series of essays on Bruce’s original work; as I get time, I’ll add links for other artists’ covers of Bruce’s material as well, as well as a calendar for easy <em>Kingdom of Days </em>browsing.</p>
<p>As always, thanks for reading, commenting, following, and sharing. I hope you stick with me as I work my way through Bruce’s entire catalog of originals and covers–we’re almost 400 in, but there’s over 1,000 to go!</p>
<p> </p>
