Sam Fender has a lot to live up to.

Still a couple of weeks away (as of this writing) from the release of his debut album, Fender is already being labelled as “the new Springsteen” because of the strength of his songwriting and the profound influence the old Springsteen had on him growing up.

So yeah, expectations are high for his debut album, but I suspect “the new Dylan” is pulling for him.

In the meantime, we have several of Fender’s Springsteen covers to listen to, and he certainly doesn’t shy away from the iconic ones–here’s a smoking rendition of Bruce’s “[Born in the U.S.A.](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/09/21/roll-of-the-dice-born-in-the-u-s-a/)”
