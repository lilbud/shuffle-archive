One time only: At Neil Young’s inaugural Bridge School Benefit in 1986, Bruce joined Crosby, Still, Nash and Young for a beautifully loose rendition of “Teach Your Children.”

Don Henley, Tom Petty, and Robin Williams(!) join in as well, and while Danny and Nils are only visible for a moment, you can hear them throughout.

The original, of course, can’t be topped.

**Update:** 35 years later, Bruce reprised “Teach Your Children” with Steve Earle, Willie Nile, and Rosanne Cash at Earle’s benefit show in New Yor City.
