<p>One time only: At Neil Young’s inaugural Bridge School Benefit in 1986, Bruce joined Crosby, Still, Nash and Young for a beautifully loose rendition of “Teach Your Children.”</p>
<p>Don Henley, Tom Petty, and Robin Williams(!) join in as well, and while Danny and Nils are only visible for a moment, you can hear them throughout.</p>

<p>The original, of course, can’t be topped.</p>
