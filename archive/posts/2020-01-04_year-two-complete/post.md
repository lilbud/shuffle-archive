Today marks the end of Year Two for this blog.



Or put another way: today marks my 1,167th post over 730 consecutive days of daily publishing, with over 443,000 visitors stopping by and another 854 of you subscribing via e-mail. (Never miss a day!)



Whether you’ve been with me from [the beginning](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/01/05/is-there-anybody-alive-out-there/) or just discovered this site for the first time [today](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/01/04/kingdom-of-days-january-4/), I wanted to take a moment to thank you for reading, following, commenting, liking and/or sharing.

Special thanks to those of you who have written to me with corrections, additional information, absolutely amazing “I was there” stories (especially my “[Where the Band Was](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/category/where-the-band-was/)” guest bloggers who gave me welcome writing reprieves from time to time–please drop me a line if you’d like to share your story too), personal anecdotes, and alternative interpretations. That’s been my absolute favorite part of these two years, and as a result I definitely feel like I’ve learned at least as much as I’ve shared. I’ve also made a lot of great new friends through the social media channels I share my blog posts in, and you all have made this a labor of love in now multiples senses.



I also have to thank one reader in particular, who not only takes the time to read every post–she also cares enough to write to me (usually within minutes of an article’s publication) to alert me whenever I publish an article with typos (which is pretty much every day). So: thank you, Lori, for making this blog look much more polished than it otherwise would!



Today also marks the end of the year-long “[Kingdom of Days](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/category/kingdom-of-days/)” series–but if you enjoy those, fear not: starting tomorrow, I’ll be updating and reblogging the entire series, with the vast majority of them featuring at least minor updates. At the very least, I’ll swap out many of the tracks from Bruce’s live shows for fresh selections, replace missing videos, and add events from 2019.



In addition, I’ll continue to spotlight an [original Springsteen song](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/roll-of-the-dice-album-by-album/), [cover](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/category/cover-me/), or [team-up](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/category/meeting-across-the-river/) each day. Hopefully, we’ll get into *Western Stars* soon–for some maddening reason the dice have absolutely refused to assign me any songs from that album to date. *Greetings* and *Wrecking Ball* are also woefully underrepresented, so I’m hoping they get some air time this year as well. (Those dice sure do like *Lucky Town* and the *Essential Bruce Springsteen* bonus disc, though… those albums are almost complete.)



I just did a quick tally of articles left to write based on the above… and it’s 919, assuming Bruce doesn’t release or cover any new music between now and then (which of course, he probably will). So this is shaping up to be a five-year mission, and we’re right in the middle of it.



Thanks again for reading. I hope you stick around for Year Three!
