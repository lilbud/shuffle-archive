That\u2019s been my absolute favorite part of these two years, and as a result I definitely feel like I\u2019ve learned at least as much as I\u2019ve shared. I\u2019ve also made a lot of great new friends through the social media channels I share my blog posts in, and you all have made this a labor of love in now multiples senses.</p> <p>I also have to thank one reader in particular, who not only takes the time to read every post\u2013she also cares enough to write to me (usually within minutes of an article\u2019s publication) to alert me whenever I publish an article with typos (which is pretty much every day). So: thank you, Lori, for making this blog look much more polished than it otherwise would!</p> <p>Today also marks the end of the year-long \u201c<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/category/kingdom-of-days/\">Kingdom of Days</a>\u201d series\u2013but if you enjoy those, fear not: starting tomorrow, I\u2019ll be updating and reblogging the entire series, with the vast majority of them featuring at least minor updates. At the very least, I\u2019ll swap out many of the tracks from Bruce\u2019s live shows for fresh selections, replace missing videos, and add events from 2019.</p> <p>In addition, I\u2019ll continue to spotlight an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/roll-of-the-dice-album-by-album/\">original Springsteen song</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/category/cover-me/\">cover</a>, or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/category/meeting-across-the-river/\">team-up</a> each day. Hopefully, we\u2019ll get into&nbsp;<em>Western Stars&nbsp;</em>soon\u2013for some maddening reason the dice have absolutely refused to assign me any songs from that album to date. <em>Greetings </em>and <em>Wrecking Ball</em> are also woefully underrepresented, so I\u2019m hoping they get some air time this year as well. (Those dice sure do like <em>Lucky Town</em> and the&nbsp;<em>Essential Bruce Springsteen</em> bonus disc, though\u2026 those albums are almost complete.)</p> <p>I just did a quick tally of articles left to write based on the above\u2026 and it\u2019s 919, assuming Bruce doesn\u2019t release or cover any new music between now and then (which of course, he probably will). So this is shaping up to be a five-year mission, and we\u2019re right in the middle of it.</p> <p>Thanks again for reading. I hope you stick around for Year Three!</p> <div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul data-sharing-events-added=\"true\"><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-15454\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/01/04/year-two-complete/?share=twitter&amp;nb=1\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-15454\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/01/04/year-two-complete/?share=facebook&amp;nb=1\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></li></ul></div></div></div><div class=\"sharedaddy sd-block sd-like jetpack-likes-widget-wrapper jetpack-likes-widget-unloaded\" id=\"like-post-wrapper-140627986-15454-60389f9de03c7\" data-src=\"https://widgets.wp.com/likes/#blog_id=140627986&amp;post_id=15454&amp;origin=estreetshuffle.com&amp;obj_id=140627986-15454-60389f9de03c7\" data-name=\"like-post-frame-140627986-15454-60389f9de03c7\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Like this:</h3><div class=\"likes-widget-placeholder post-likes-widget-placeholder\" style=\"height: 55px;\"><span class=\"button\"><span>Like</span></span> <span class=\"loading\">Loading...</span></div><span class=\"sd-text-color\"></span><a class=\"sd-link-color\"></a></div> <div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\"> </div>", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>We&#8217;re two years old!
