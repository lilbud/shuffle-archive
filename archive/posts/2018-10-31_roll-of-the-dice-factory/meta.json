While I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;ve heard it once in concert (to satisfy the completist in me), I&#8217;m more than happy to never hear Bruce perform it again. It&#8217;s plodding, monotonous, and devoid of hope. It&#8217;s no fun to sing along with, and it sucks the energy out of the room whenever and wherever it&#8217;s played.</p>\n<p>That said:</p>\n<p>I\u00a0<em>love</em> this song. Its lyrical economy, the dance between Danny&#8217;s organ and Roy&#8217;s piano, the way the Bruce&#8217;s vocals and Max&#8217;s incessant drumbeat combine to drive home the world-weariness and rut that is at the very heart of the song, the way Bruce double-tracks his vocals on the last line of each verse&#8211;one high, one low to represent both the blessing and curse of factory work&#8230; holy cow, this is a stunning piece of work&#8211;and barely more than two minutes in length!</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll break it down, but let&#8217;s take a listen first:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Factory\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3YuEJ_XolkM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Let&#8217;s state the obvious, first: this is\u00a0<em>clearly</em> an autobiographical song. Bruce is usually coy about how much a given song is drawn from reality, but we certainly know that his dad worked in a factory (among the many gigs Douglas Springsteen held during his life). But the most telling detail is in the second verse: &#8220;Factory takes his hearing.&#8221; We know that about his dad, too, so it would seem that &#8220;Factory&#8221; is a naked attempt to come to grips with the role and the impact the factory had on Bruce&#8217;s father and family life&#8211;despite Bruce&#8217;s timid attempt to generalize the song to simply &#8220;Man.&#8221;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Early in the morning factory whistle blows</em><br />\n<em>Man rises from bed and puts on his clothes</em><br />\n<em>Man takes his lunch, walks out in the morning light</em><br />\n<em>It&#8217;s the working, the working, just the working life</em></p>\n<p>Or maybe it wasn&#8217;t Bruce&#8217;s intent to generalize at all. Bruce has spoken, written, and sung about how he formed his views of manhood by observing his dad, both for examples and counter-examples. So when Bruce refers to &#8220;Man&#8221; in this song, that may very well be the purest distillation of how he sees his father&#8211;Bruce&#8217;s archetype of manhood.</p>\n<p>Semantics aside, just look at the economy in that verse&#8211;there&#8217;s not a single word wasted. Where in the world did\u00a0<em>this</em> Bruce Springsteen come from? The writer who never met an adjective he didn&#8217;t like, the geographer with a detailed atlas of streets and lakes and rivers, the scenarist with a posse of colorful characters to populate his terrain&#8230; all are missing in action, and in their place is a fearless diarist staring his pain in the face and confronting it, stripped of all metaphor.</p>\n<p>Well, maybe not\u00a0<em>all</em> metaphor:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Through the mansions of fear, through the mansions of pain</em><br />\n<em>I see my daddy walking through them factory gates in the rain</em><br />\n<em>Factory takes his hearing, factory gives him life</em><br />\n<em>The working, the working, just the working life</em></p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s talk about those mansions for a moment. They are the only metaphor in the entire song, and I don&#8217;t believe that&#8217;s by accident.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Factory&#8221; was released on\u00a0<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/07/05/album-companion-darkness-on-the-edge-of-town/\"><em>Darkness on the Edge of Town</em></a>, the follow-up album to\u00a0<em>Born to Run</em>. Where the former album is full of romance and color,\u00a0<em>Darkness\u00a0</em>is spare, dark, and\u00a0<em>real</em>. In <em>Born to Run&#8217;s</em> anthemic title track, Bruce rides through &#8220;mansions of glory.&#8221; Meanwhile, in &#8220;Factory,&#8221; his dad walks through mansions of fear and pain.</p>\n<p>When you listen to the two songs side-by-side, it&#8217;s hard not to read a note of guilt into Bruce&#8217;s subdued &#8220;Factory&#8221; vocals. His dad doesn&#8217;t have the escape of the open road that Bruce writes about (neither did Bruce, actually, when he wrote &#8220;Born to Run&#8221; &#8212; I&#8217;d argue that the road imagery of &#8220;Born to Run&#8221; is a metaphor itself for the release and escape that Bruce found in music, but that&#8217;s an essay for another day). The sacrifice that his father made for his family every day when he went to work&#8211;losing his hearing, surrendering his dreams, whittling his life even as the factory sustains it&#8211;is a theme that recurs in Bruce&#8217;s early work as he struggles to come to terms with it, until he finally confronts it head on in &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/03/14/roll-of-the-dice-independence-day/\">Independence Day</a>.&#8221; (&#8220;I swear I never meant to take those things away.&#8221;)</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>End of the day, factory whistle cries</em><br />\n<em>Men walk through these gates with death in their eyes</em><br />\n<em>And you just better believe, boy, somebody&#8217;s gonna get hurt tonight</em><br />\n<em>It&#8217;s the working, the working, just the working life</em><br />\n<em>Cause it&#8217;s the working, the working, just the working life</em></p>\n<p>The most chilling line of the song is buried deep within that last verse: for everything the factory gives to families of the men who work within it, it exacts a price in return. For at least some of the men, the death of their dreams and aspirations gives birth to a seething, simmering anger, and Bruce implies that it&#8217;s an anger that can&#8217;t be indefinitely contained. There&#8217;s an undercurrent of abuse in that town&#8211;whether physical, verbal, or emotional (perhaps all three), we don&#8217;t know. We certainly know that for Bruce, at least, it took the form of some pretty heated late-night arguments that would be recounted on stage years later.</p>\n<p>And all the while, Roy and Danny are intricately embellishing on Bruce&#8217;s very simply stated melody, finding and shining a light on the beauty that life holds even when routine is so deep-set as to become a prison. As if to drive the point home, Bruce&#8217;s double-tracked &#8220;working, the working, just the working life&#8221; soars and plods simultaneously.</p>\n<p>And once again&#8211;Bruce accomplishes all this in under two minutes and thirty seconds.</p>\n<p>Like I said: I love this song. I just don&#8217;t like it.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Factory&#8221; came out to play on a regular basis during the\u00a0Darkness\u00a0\u00a0and River\u00a0tours. Here&#8217;s its very first performance, from Nashville, on July 21, 1978:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - &quot;Factory&quot; - Nashville, 1978-07-21\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VRKoRUCKFH8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>After the River Tour, however, &#8220;Factory&#8221; pretty much disappeared until the Reunion era. One performance in particular from the Reunion Tour is notable for the addition of strings, courtesy of guest-star Soozie Tyrell (she wouldn&#8217;t join the band for another three years).</p>\n<audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-5306-3\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/106-Factory-online-audio-converter.com_.mp3?_=3\" /><a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/106-Factory-online-audio-converter.com_.mp3\">http://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/106-Factory-online-audio-converter.com_.mp3</a></audio>\n<p>Interestingly, that wasn&#8217;t an altogether new arrangement. An alternate take of &#8220;Factory&#8221; with strings was considered at one point&#8211;you&#8217;d recognize it as the instrumental track from &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/12/05/roll-of-the-dice-come-on-lets-go-tonight/\">Come On, Let&#8217;s Go Tonight</a>&#8221; from <em>The Promise.\u00a0</em>(Both of those officially released songs use virtually the same instrumental track, except for the violin absent from &#8220;Factory.&#8221;) Take a listen to the unreleased outtake (featuring David Lindley on violin) below:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - &quot;Factory&quot; (alternate with strings)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lKyCP-0DUbs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>This version also has a minor but significant lyrical change&#8211;&#8220;Factory takes his hearing, but he understands: He&#8217;s a working, a working, just a working man.&#8221; That implication of acceptance is probably a step too far for the man, who is never fully at peace with his trade-off.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll leave you with two other notable performances of &#8220;Factory,&#8221; both of which I think do an admirable job of matching (but not surpassing) the beauty of the original recording.</p>\n<p>The first is Bruce&#8217;s opening number from a Labor Day concert in Philadelphia in 2012, performed solo and acoustic on guitar and harmonica:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Factory (acoustic) Bruce Springsteen Philadelphia 09/03/12\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/UR7q2gX1lBE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8230;and the second is a full-band performance in the empty Paramount Theater in Asbury Park. There&#8217;s something about the empty hall, the lack of an audience that forces Bruce to look inward for connection rather than outward&#8211;and the close-up camera captures his emotion and reminiscence throughout.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen &amp; The E Street Band - Factory (Live at The Paramount Theatre 2009)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/plaOhNjJeBg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><strong>Factory<br />\nRecorded:</strong> October-November, 1977<br />\n<strong>Released:</strong>\u00a0<em>Darkness on the Edge of Town\u00a0</em>(1978)<br />\n<strong>First performed:</strong> July 21, 1978 (Nashville, TN)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> September 5, 2016 (Virginia Beach, VA)</p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
