***New for 2025:** Review for 1970; new entry for 1979; video for 2004*

**1970:** Steel Mill opens for The Ike and Tina Turner Revue at a shockingly (at least in retrospect) underattended show at The Mosque in Richmond.

**1974:** Bruce and the E Street Band headline at the Shady Grove Music Fair in Gaithersburg, Maryland. Starting at this show, Suki Lahav joins the band for the remainder of the tour.

**1975:** Bruce makes his first appearance on *American Top 40* with his charting single, “Born to Run.”

That evening, Bruce and the boys play two homecoming shows at Monmouth Arts Center in Red Bank. David Sancious makes a guest appearance during the late show on “[Carol](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/02/17/cover-me-carol/),” and the entire late show can be heard below. Both shows are filmed by Barry Rebo, and snippets will surface years later in official documentaries for *Born to Run* and *[Darkness on the Edge of Town](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/07/05/album-companion-darkness-on-the-edge-of-town/)*.

**1979:** Bruce records “[Crush on You](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/02/02/roll-of-the-dice-crush-on-you/)” with the E Street Band at The Power Station in New York City.

**1980:** At Night Two at Chicago’s Uptown Theater on the River Tour, Bruce tour premieres “[For You](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/01/08/roll-of-the-dice-for-you/)” and “[Good Rockin’ Tonight](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/09/17/cover-me-good-rockin-tonight/),” and “[I Wanna Marry You](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/04/22/roll-of-the-dice-i-wanna-marry-you/)” features a new introduction (actually an older unreleased song) called “[Here She Comes Walkin’](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/09/24/roll-of-the-dice-here-she-comes-walkin/).” Bruce will resurrect this introduction more than 35 years later on the River Tour’s sequel.

**1998:** Bruce celebrates his birthday belatedly with a private party at his house. The Gotham Playboys–several members of whom will form the core of the Seeger Sessions Band–are the entertainment for the evening, and Steve, Max, Jon Bon Jovi, and Sheryl Crow are among the guests.

**2004:** The Vote for Change Tour officially wraps at the MCI Center in Washington, DC. (There will be an epilogue of sorts in New Jersey a couple of days later, though.) This finale unites many of the headline performers in one giant simulcast show featuring Bruce, Jackson Browne, Bonnie Raitt, John Mellencamp, R.E.M., James Taylor, Pearl Jam, the Dave Matthews Band, the Dixie Chicks, and more.

**2017:** One final tweak during the last preview performance of *Springsteen on Broadway:* “[Long Walk Home](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/03/21/roll-of-the-dice-long-walk-home/)” and “[The Rising](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/11/21/roll-of-the-dice-the-rising/)” return to their original sequence.

**2018:** *Springsteen on Broadway* continues its theatrical run at the Walter Kerr Theater in New York City.

**2019:** Bruce attends the BFI London Film Festival, where he introduces his new film *Western Stars* and answers questions with Thom Zimny afterward. Bruce makes news during the Q&A when he definitively states that his near future involves touring with the E Street Band, and at least for the next several months, that seems to be in the cards.
