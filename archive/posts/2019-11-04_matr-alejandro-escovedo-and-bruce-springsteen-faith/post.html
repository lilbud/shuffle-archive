<p>In 2010, Bruce and Alejandro recorded their first studio track together, and yup… faith was rewarded.</p>

<p>“Faith” may be pretty straightforward lyrically, but it travels some familiar thematic territory to Springsteen fans. It’s also a driving, shredding song that allowed Bruce to cut loose with a gravelly rock vocal of the kind that had gone mostly missing on Bruce’s recent <em>Working on a Dream </em>album.</p>
<p>And if Bruce was gonna take the time to record with Alejandro in the studio, you just knew he was gonna show up at The Stone Pony when Alejandro came through town that summer.</p>
<p>He did not disappoint. Here’s Bruce and Alejandro playing their one and only performance of “Faith” together, on July 23, 2010.</p>
