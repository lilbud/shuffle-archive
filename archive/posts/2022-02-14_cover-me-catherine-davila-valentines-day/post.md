Here’s another cover by an artist I’ve given up trying to find information about. It’s too lovely and too timely to keep this on the “maybe someday” list any longer.

I know nothing about Catherine Davila–and I mean *nothing*. I can’t find any trace of her on the Web or on social media, and her YouTube channel only has three videos, all of which were uploaded years ago.

But one of those three videos is a tender cover of Bruce Springsteen’s “[Valentine’s Day,](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/06/12/roll-of-the-dice-valentines-day/)” and Catherine’s performance suggests she’s an artist of considerable talent both as a singer and an arranger.

Bruce’s original version has a desperate urgency to it; Catherine’s version is easier, more secure, but no less tender and devoted–in fact, it may even be more so.

She chose to drop the song’s second verse, and that decision completely transforms the song. No longer does a friend’s life-altering event prompt the narrator’s own revelation. Instead, her version of “Valentine’s Day” is a true valentine–a pledge of constant and enduring love, underscored by warm strings.

Happy day to all the valentines out there, lonely and otherwise.
