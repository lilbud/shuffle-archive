<p>How many <em>Born in the U.S.A. </em>songs charted as singles?</p>
<p>…stump your questioner by answering eight instead of seven.</p>
<p>Because in addition to “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/12/25/roll-of-the-dice-dancing-in-the-dark/">Dancing in the Dark</a>,” “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/01/13/roll-of-the-dice-cover-me/">Cover Me</a>,” “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/09/21/roll-of-the-dice-born-in-the-u-s-a/">Born in the U.S.A.,</a>” “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/09/11/roll-of-the-dice-im-on-fire/">I’m on Fire</a>,” “Glory Days,” “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/06/05/roll-of-the-dice-im-goin-down/">I’m Goin’ Down</a>,” and “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/04/09/roll-of-the-dice-my-hometown/">My Hometown</a>,” one other song made a brief appearance on the Billboard charts.</p>
<p>Except it was the Country chart rather than the Hot 100, and it didn’t chart until 1986.</p>
<p>Oh, and Bruce Springsteen wasn’t the recording artist.</p>
<p>Jeff Stevens and the Bullets recorded “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/09/10/roll-of-the-dice-darlington-county/">Darlington County</a>” as their debut single and took it to #69 on the U.S. Country chart.</p>

<p>The single was successful enough to earn Stevens a live television performance on The Nashville Network in 1987.</p>

<p>That success led the way to their 1987 debut album, <em>Bolt Out of the Blue, </em>which featured their Springsteen cover, advertise prominently on the album cover.</p>
<p>The album didn’t break through. Neither did their follow-up self-titled album. None of their singles cracked the Top 40 on any chart, and the band finally broke up in 1990. Stevens went on to a successful career as a songwriter and producer.</p>
<p>The story of Jeff Stevens and the Bullets is a short one, but it earned Bruce an eighth charting single (as songwriter, at least) from his landmark album.</p>
