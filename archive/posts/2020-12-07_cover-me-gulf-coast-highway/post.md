In February 1988, just prior to the kickoff of Bruce’s Tunnel of Love Express Tour, Nanci Griffith released her sixth studio album, 

*Little Love Affairs.*

Tucked away at the end of Side One of that album is a gorgeous duet with Mac McAnally called “Gulf Coast Highway,” that sounds for all the world like a Bruce Springsteen song.

In fact, with lyrics like these, “Gulf Coast Highway” would be right at home on (even though that album was still seven years in the future):

*The Ghost of Tom Joad*



*Gulf coast highway, he worked the rails*  
*He worked the rice fields with their cold dark wells*  
*He worked the oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico*  
*The only thing we’ve owned is this old house here by the road*



*…*



*Highway 90, the jobs are gone*  
*We kept our garden, we set the sun*  
*This is the only place on Earth blue bonnets grow*  
*And once a year they come and go*  
*At this old house here by the road*

Bruce was apparently taken with the song, because not long after the song’s release, he soundchecked it at least once. The recording below is from a soundcheck sometime during his stand at Madison Square Garden in 1988. Take a listen–it’s a beautiful arrangement featuring Patti’s lovely backing vocals.

Too bad Bruce bluffs some of the vocals; this is one cover I’d love to have a true recording of.

(but soundchecked in 1988)

**Gulf Coast Highway**  
**Never performed live**
