The Beatles make their third appearance on the Ed Sullivan show, and fourteen-year-old Bruce Springsteen is watching.

In the wee hours of Sunday morning, Bruce, Vinnie Roslin, and Big Bad Bobby Williams jam at The Upstage in Asbury Park. Danny Federici joins in, and Vini Lopez swaps in for Williams. That foursome (Springsteen, Roslin, Federici, and Lopez) will soon gel as a band called Child, which by the end of the year will become Steel Mill.

**1969:**

Ernest “Boom” Carter makes his debut as the E Street Band’s drummer at the Satellite Lounge in Cookstown, New Jersey. Bruce tried to cancel this show to give Carter time to come up to speed on the band’s material, but the owner of the club took that news in a very New Jersey fashion. I’ll let Bruce tell the rest of the story:

**1974:**

Bruce and the E Street Band play the Westbury Music Fair in Westbury, New York. The stage rotates (or at least it does until it stops during the encores). Listen to the soundcheck below.

Bruce and Madonna make a surprise appearance on-stage with Prince at The Forum in Inglewood, CA. The three mega-stars play “” together. Some sources say that Bruce stayed on stage for “America,” and “” with Prince as well, but those reports are unconfirmed. Brucebase leans towards it because they hear Prince yelling “Bruce” at the beginning of “America,” but I’m pretty sure Prince is actually saying “Peace!” (the first word of the song). Regardless, I’m sharing those two tracks here just in case. They are certainly amazing performances regardless of whether Bruce appears on them or not.
