He was also the oldest, a full decade older than his high school student bandmates.</p>\n<p>He was the band&#8217;s bass player for their first year, until a kid asked him after a show if he was Bruce&#8217;s daddy.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I took that as a sign that it was time for me to go,&#8221; he told an interviewer.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Danny Hyland (backing vocals, harmonica, tambourine), Richie Goldstein (backing vocals and guitar), Curt Fluhr (replacement bassist after Marziotti&#8217;s departure) also completed their life journeys in the years since The Castiles went their separate ways.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>After Marziotti&#8217;s passing, only two Castiles remained.</p>\n<p>They shared a birthday month, born days apart in September 1949. George Theiss formed The Castiles in 1964 (they were called The Sierras at the time) and began dating a girl named Ginny in 1965. When Ginny told her boyfriend that her brother Bruce played guitar too, George invited him to join the band.</p>\n<p>Bruce remembers George as &#8220;kind of a regular guy. He was a carpenter by trade, and I believe that that&#8217;s how he made his living through most of his life, and played music on the side. But actually, as a teenager, he was quite charismatic: He was very good looking, attracted a lot of girls and had a great sort of tenor voice, and was really, initially, the frontman for The Castiles \u2014 I was simply the guitarist. And so he was a bit of our local star, you know, and he locally maintained that reputation for quite a big part of his life in Asbury Park.&#8221; (NPR, October 22, 2020)</p>\n<p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-attachment-id=\"39106\" data-permalink=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/11/19/roll-of-the-dice-last-man-standing/ehzg5znxgaef-nh-4/#main\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Ehzg5ZnXgAEf-nH-4.jpg?fit=452%2C440&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"452,440\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1667241089&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Ehzg5ZnXgAEf-nH (4)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Ehzg5ZnXgAEf-nH-4.jpg?fit=300%2C292&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Ehzg5ZnXgAEf-nH-4.jpg?fit=452%2C440&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-39106\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Ehzg5ZnXgAEf-nH-4.jpg?resize=452%2C440&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"452\" height=\"440\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Ehzg5ZnXgAEf-nH-4.jpg?w=452&amp;ssl=1 452w, https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Ehzg5ZnXgAEf-nH-4.jpg?resize=300%2C292&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Ehzg5ZnXgAEf-nH-4.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 452px) 100vw, 452px\" /></p>\n<p>In their post-Castile years, George formed his own eponymous band after stints in various local groups; Bruce earned himself a recording contract with Columbia Records and won over audiences worldwide.</p>\n<p>In the summer of 2018, Bruce flew to his bedside to say goodbye to his old friend, who was dying of cancer.

His Broadway run was over, no tour was on the horizon, and it had been some time since he&#8217;d been visited by a muse. Something tugged at him though, and in the early days of spring, the dam broke.</p>\n<p>Over the course of about ten days in April 2019, Bruce wrote the songs that would form the heart of\u00a0<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2023/07/10/album-companion-letter-to-you/\"><em>Letter to You</em></a>. &#8220;I just wandered around the house in different rooms,&#8221; he told Brian Hiatt in\u00a0<em>Rolling Stone</em>, &#8220;and I wrote a song each day. I wrote a song in the bedroom. I wrote a song in our bar. I wrote a song in the living room.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The first song&#8211;the one that established the theme for the album and inspired all that came after&#8211;was &#8220;Last Man Standing.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Last Man Standing\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8ldvyBNYqCY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Bruce wrote &#8220;Last Man Standing&#8221; on an acoustic guitar given to him by an anonymous Italian fan as Bruce exited the Walter Kerr Theater one evening.\u00a0 He was intrigued by the quality of the guitar and its mysterious origin, and he kept it in his living room where it sat neglected until Bruce reached for it as inspiration struck.</p>\n<p>The concept was deceptively simple: the youthful energy and experience of a high school rock band viewed through the lens of its last survivor some fifty years later. Bruce composed a nostalgic, almost elegiac melody that rocks just enough for minds to conjure a band at its prime, yet restrained enough that Bruce&#8217;s vocals stand above and apart, particularly during the reflective verses.</p>\n<p>The verses are simple and ruminatory: decades on, a band member leafs through the pages of an old scrapbook&#8211;long enough ago that he no longer remembers who captured the faded photos.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Faded pictures in an old scrapbook</em><br />\n<em>Faded pictures that somebody took</em><br />\n<em>When you were hard and young and proud</em><br />\n<em>Backed against the wall running raw and loud</em></p>\n<p>Losing himself in the photos and the details they reveal, he finds old memories newly stirred. We&#8217;re transported back to the mid-1960s and the local circuit on the Jersey shore.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Snakeskin vest and a sharkskin suit</em><br />\n<em>Cuban heels on your boots</em><br />\n<em>Kicking the band in side by side</em><br />\n<em>You take the crowd on their mystery ride</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Knights of Columbus and the Fireman&#8217;s Ball</em><br />\n<em>Friday night at the Union Hall</em><br />\n<em>Black leather clubs all along Route 9</em><br />\n<em>You count the names of the missing as you count off time</em></p>\n<p>With that last line, Bruce reveals that our narrator is both past and present. His young body stands on the stage beside his bandmates as his older soul marvels at the vitality of his long-gone friends. It&#8217;s one of only two powerful lyrical tricks in an otherwise straightforward song, and the second one comes immediately after:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Rock of ages lift me somehow</em><br />\n<em>Somewhere high and hard and loud</em><br />\n<em>Somewhere deep into the heart of the crowd</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;m the last man standing now</em></p>\n<p><em>Rock of ages.\u00a0</em>It could have served as the song&#8217;s title, too.</p>\n<p>As is his wont, Bruce uses the phrase to symbolize two things at once: the biblical metaphor for everlasting strength, and the literal reference to his life&#8217;s work. He calls on both to lift his soul in transcendence, as he attempts to forget the present and immerse himself in the past.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s only for the moment, though, and as the lights come up we realize that our bandleader is still at it.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Out of school and out of work</em><br />\n<em>Thrift store jeans and flannel shirt</em><br />\n<em>The lights go down and we face the crowd</em><br />\n<em>The last man standing now</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Lights come up at the Legion Hall</em><br />\n<em>Pool cues go back up on the wall</em><br />\n<em>You pack your guitar and have one last beer</em><br />\n<em>With just the ringing in your ears</em></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s present day; our narrator is long since out of school and retired now as well. His bandmates are different but the venues are the same. When the lights go down he imagines himself surrounded not just by his current band but by the spirits of his fallen former bandmates, too.</p>\n<p>Once again he beseeches the divine spirits of both God and Rock and Roll for the strength to carry on&#8211;not just for himself, but for his brothers.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Rock of ages lift me somehow</em><br />\n<em>Somewhere high and hard and loud</em><br />\n<em>Somewhere deep into the heart of the crowd</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;m the last man standing now</em></p>\n<p>For every great band, there&#8217;s a last man standing (or there will be), and as long as he stands on stage each night, his band stands with him. Or as Springsteen put it to his audience more than four decades into his career: <em>if you&#8217;re here, and we&#8217;re here, then they&#8217;re here.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Bruce recorded &#8220;Last Man Standing&#8221; just prior to the pandemic of 2020, and he hasn&#8217;t had an opportunity to perform it in public yet. That may change next year, but in the meantime we can hear two brief, live acoustic performances, each performed during an interview.</p>\n<p>The first was shortly after the song&#8217;s release in October 2020 when Bruce appeared on Malcolm Gladwell and Rick Rubin&#8217;s podcast,\u00a0<em>Broken Record.</em></p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Last Man Standing (solo acoustic)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CNsrCkJ_VBc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>The second was just a couple of weeks ago during Bruce&#8217;s interview with Howard Stern.</p>\n<audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-38925-8\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Stern-LMS.mp3?_=8\" /><a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Stern-LMS.mp3\">https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Stern-LMS.mp3</a></audio>\n<p>As the genesis for <em>Letter to You</em>, &#8220;Last Man Standing&#8221; seems like a pretty good bet for at least a few set list appearances on Bruce&#8217;s next tour&#8211;which as of this writing is only weeks away.
