Ah, the summer of 1971: a golden era for fans of the soul side of Bruce Springsteen.

I’m far too young to have caught The Bruce Springsteen Band live in concert (I was only three years old when they disbanded), but I seem to turn to those bootlegs whenever summer nears. Something about those warm, bluesy rock and soul arrangements feels appropriate for a lazy, sunny afternoon.

Today, we’ll take a listen to one of my favorite original songs from this period: “Natural Magic,” performed on at least three occasions but captured on tape only once–on July 29, 1971 at D’Scene in South Amboy, New Jersey.

“Natural Magic” may be an original Springsteen song, but it clearly owes a debt of influence to Van Morrison. We can clearly hear the similarities with “,” released the year prior.

“Natural Magic” doesn’t tread any new lyrical ground either–mountain high/water wide pairings weren’t exactly original ideas by that time.

*I’d climb a mountain if you want me to*  
*I’d swim the ocean just to get to you*  
*I’d do most anything that you ask me to do*  
*Don’t you know now darling, my loving’s for you*  
*Oh but don’t take me for a fool*  
*‘Cause it’d be the wrong thing to do*  
*In the end it sure would be tragic*  
*Because my baby’s natural magic*



*I’d steal the moon from the midnight sky*  
*Sprinkle him with stardust and tie him in butterflies*  
*I’d buy for you a sailing ship and I’d set out on the sea*  
*All I ask of you, darling: you let me be free*  
*And if that is too much to do*  
*To keep my girl from singing the blues*  
*In the end it sure would be tragic*  
*Because my baby’s natural magic*

And yet, despite wearing its influences on its sleeve, “Natural Magic” is sweet and charmingly earnest. Together with songs like “” (played just two songs prior that night) and “,” “Natural Magic” represents the beginning of a soulfully romantic vein that Bruce would mine for many years to come.
