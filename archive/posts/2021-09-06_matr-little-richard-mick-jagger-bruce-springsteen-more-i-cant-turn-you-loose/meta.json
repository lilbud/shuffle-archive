(You can clearly hear it in their single, &#8220;Time Is Tight.&#8221;)</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Booker T. &amp; The MG&#039;s  -  Time Is Tight\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/50xx1_CbJTI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Otis layered on that iconic horn riff, and they were off and running. They didn&#8217;t have to run far, though, because there are hardly any lyrics in the song&#8211;which is surprising, considering how much singing there is. That&#8217;s how good Redding was: he could pack so much passion into his performance that you&#8217;d never realize how insubstantial the song is without him.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"I Can&#039;t Turn You Loose\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GTHFpP5V6Kw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Redding released it in 1965 as the B-side to &#8220;Just One More Day.&#8221; Neither side cracked the Billboard Hot 100, but &#8220;I Can&#8217;t Turn You Loose&#8221; outperformed its A-side on the R&amp;B chart by four notches, peaking at #11. It went on to become one of his signature songs.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I Can&#8217;t Turn You Loose&#8221; inspired an impressive slate of cover artists including Ike and Tina Turner, Mick Jagger, and Aretha Franklin&#8211;all spectacular stage presences themselves, which is what you need to be if you&#8217;re going to pull off the song like Otis could.</p>\n<p>In 1989, Otis Redding was inducted into the fourth class of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and when it came time for the all-star jam session, there was no way the assembled icons were going to pass up a chance to tackle &#8220;I Can&#8217;t Turn You Loose.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Lil Richard &amp; Mick Jagger - I Cant Turn You Loose 1989\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\"

spot Bruce Springsteen on guitar.</p>\n<p>And yes, I realize that&#8217;s a bit of a stretch to qualify for a Springsteen-centric blog, but I figure any time your week starts with watching a pair of
