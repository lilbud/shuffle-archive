One of the highlights of Bruce Springsteen’s Australian High Hopes Tour was his gorgeously arranged cover of “” by the Bee Gees. It was so good that even Barry Gibb was blown away by it. (Don’t take my word for it, though.)

Dear Bruce , just been blown away by your Stayin Alive. You brought it back to life.Thank you!

So when Barry kicked off his own American tour a few months later, he decided to repay the favor.

At his tour opener (and at many of the shows thereafter), Barry’s set included a cover of Bruce’s 1985 hit, “.” Here’s his performance from Chicago, on May 27, 2014:

I suspect Barry chose the song to show off that famous falsetto of his, and based on the crowd’s reaction it was an inspired choice.
