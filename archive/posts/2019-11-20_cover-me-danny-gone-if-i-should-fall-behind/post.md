I realize that Springsteen covers are a mixed bag; just because we love the song when performed by its original artists doesn’t mean the song translates well to others.

But trust me on this: stop what you’re doing for a minute, and listen to this absolutely gorgeous cover of “,” one of Bruce’s finest songs. It’s brand new (released just days ago as I write this), but it’s immediately cemented as one of my top ten Springsteen covers of all-time.

I’m unfamiliar with Danny Gone’s original work, but you can bet I’m going to seek it out after listening to his tender arrangement and mesmerizing performance.

Well done, Mr. Gone. well done.

*Very*
