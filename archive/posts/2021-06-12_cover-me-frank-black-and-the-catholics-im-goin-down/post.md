This past year’s quarantine has brought us so many great new Springsteen covers that I’ve fallen way, *way* behind on the original list of covers I was working my way through when I started this series.

So let’s take a trip back to the “classic” covers for at least a couple of installments.

This one’s been stuck in my head since I wrote my *Roll of the Dice* article on “[I’m Goin’ Down](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/06/05/roll-of-the-dice-im-goin-down/)” recently. Frank Black’s cover is crunchy, grungy, and loud–exactly what you’d expect if you read Bruce’s lyrics before listening to the song. Turn this one up *loud*.

Oh yeah.

It’s not nearly as fun as Bruce’s poppy original, but boy is it cathartic.

Frank released his cover of “I’m Goin’ Down” (recorded with The Catholics, not The Pixies) as the B-side to his 1998 single, “Dog Gone.” Good luck finding the original single, though–you’re better off seeking out the band’s complete box set, which includes it.
