<p>So let’s take a trip back to the “classic” covers for at least a couple of installments.</p>
<p>This one’s been stuck in my head since I wrote my <em>Roll of the Dice</em> article on “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/06/05/roll-of-the-dice-im-goin-down/">I’m Goin’ Down</a>” recently. Frank Black’s cover is crunchy, grungy, and loud–exactly what you’d expect if you read Bruce’s lyrics before listening to the song. Turn this one up <em>loud</em>.</p>

<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>It’s not nearly as fun as Bruce’s poppy original, but boy is it cathartic.</p>
<p>Frank released his cover of “I’m Goin’ Down” (recorded with The Catholics, not The Pixies) as the B-side to his 1998 single, “Dog Gone.” Good luck finding the original single, though–you’re better off seeking out the band’s complete box set, which includes it.</p>
