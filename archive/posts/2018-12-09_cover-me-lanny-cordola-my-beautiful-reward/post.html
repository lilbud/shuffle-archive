<p>Sometimes a wonderful cover can fly completely under the radar.</p>
<p>This is one of them.</p>

<p>Lanny Cordola has associated himself with a few bands over the years, but he’s a wonderful musician in his own right. (He plays every instrument you hear on this track.)</p>
<p>His 2001 spin on “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2023/02/19/roll-of-the-dice-my-beautiful-reward/">My Beautiful Reward</a>” is original in sound but true in spirit to the original; it’s more reflective and atmospheric than Bruce’s album version, and his vocals and arrangement really bring out the narrative.</p>
<p>This is very well done.</p>
