virtually every American state, the Sinaloa cartel ran a frighteningly efficient and lucrative operation&#8211;one that proved irresistibly tempting to field workers doing back-breaking labor for a fraction of the pay. &#8220;Workers who earn as little as $5,000 a year picking California&#8217;s crops can make that much in half a dozen illicit cooking sessions,&#8221; wrote Arax and Gorman.</p>\n<p>But the rewards came at great risk: the byproduct hydriodic acid fumes claimed countless lives. &#8220;One cook had 18 bottles cooking at one time with four sub-cooks,&#8221; said state agent Dan Callahan to the reporters. &#8220;But there were no condensers [to contain the fumes]. They were breathing acid gases and spitting blood.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;&#8216;Farm labor is a dangerous occupation&#8217; said Merced County Sheriff&#8217;s Detective Mario Anaya. &#8216;Unfortunately, they are trading that job for an even more dangerous one.'&#8221;</p>\n<p>That article made a lasting impression on Bruce. Later that summer, Arax received a phone call from someone claiming to be Bruce Springsteen&#8217;s assistant. The Boss, it seemed, was looking for some background on the people Arax and Gorman had reported on, their places and their language. &#8220;Springsteen saturates himself with just enough in a place and language to bring it off with realism,&#8221; Arax observed to the <em>Fresno Bee</em> in 1996, and he told the <em>Los Angeles Times </em>that Bruce &#8220;&#8221;needed to get an image in his mind of this valley that he may have never seen before, and it was interesting being a conduit for that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Arax shared what he could and then promptly forgot about the conversation&#8211;until that autumn, when he received a fax with Bruce&#8217;s lyrics for a song called &#8220;Sinaloa Cowboys.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But Arax and Gorman weren&#8217;t the only inspiration for Bruce&#8217;s tale.\u00a0&#8220;A song like &#8216;Sinaloa Cowboys&#8217; came from a lot of places,&#8221; Bruce told Will Percy in <em>DoubleTake</em> in 1998. &#8220;I&#8217;d met a guy in the Arizona desert when I happened to be on a trip with some friends of mine, and he had a younger brother who died in a motorcycle accident. There&#8217;s something abut conversations with people&#8211;people you&#8217;ve met once and you&#8217;ll never see again&#8211;that always stays with me.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Something about his transient friend&#8217;s intimately personal tragedy combined with the backdrop of a larger epidemic fused in Bruce&#8217;s mind, and the result was the quiet short story/folk song that Bruce included on his 1995 album,\u00a0<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2023/06/03/album-companion-the-ghost-of-tom-joad/\"><em>The Ghost of Tom Joad</em></a>.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Sinaloa Cowboys\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zOVHCOOqJyo?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;Sinaloa Cowboys&#8221; is the tragic three-act story of Miguel and Louis Rosales, two fictional young brothers from northern Mexico who cross the border to make a decent living as field workers in California, despite their father&#8217;s warning that no gift comes without a price. It&#8217;s a somber, contemplative performance, performed entirely by Bruce and solely on his acoustic guitar and keyboard.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well Miguel came from a small town in northern Mexico</em><br />\n<em>He came north with his brother Louis to California three years ago</em><br />\n<em>They crossed at the river levee when Louis was just sixteen</em><br />\n<em>And found work together in the fields of the San Joaquin</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>They left their homes and family, their father said, &#8220;My sons one thing you will learn</em><br />\n<em>For everything the north gives, it exacts a price in return&#8221;</em><br />\n<em>They worked side by side in the orchards from morning till the day was through</em><br />\n<em>Doing the work the hueros wouldn&#8217;t do</em></p>\n<p>Before long, the brothers hear of an opportunity to earn far greater rewards for far less work, cooking meth for the Sinaloa cartel. Bruce threads detail from Arax and Gorman&#8217;s article throughout Act Two, and it&#8217;s a testament to his craft that Bruce is able to rhyme <em>methamphetamine</em> in service of the story and make <em>hydriodic acid</em> sound melodic.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Word was out some men in from Sinaloa were looking for some hands</em><br />\n<em>Well deep in Fresno County there was a deserted chicken ranch</em><br />\n<em>And there in a small tin shack on the edge of a ravine</em><br />\n<em>Miguel and Louis stood cooking methamphetamine</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>You could spend a year in the orchards or make half as much in one ten-hour shift</em><br />\n<em>Working for the men from Sinaloa, ah but if you slipped</em><br />\n<em>The hydriodic acid could burn right through your skin</em><br />\n<em>They&#8217;d leave you spitting up blood in the desert if you breathed those fumes in</em></p>\n<p>As I noted above, this is not a tale that ends well, and we can tell where it&#8217;s going based on the detail Bruce chooses to include. Sure enough, disaster strikes in the song&#8217;s final act: an explosion in the laboratory claims the life of Louis Rosales. Miguel kisses his brother goodbye and buries him in an unmarked grave.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>It was early one winter evening as Miguel stood watch outside</em><br />\n<em>When the shack exploded, lighting up the valley night</em><br />\n<em>Miguel carried Louis&#8217;s body over his shoulder down a swale to the creek side</em><br />\n<em>And there in the tall grass Louis Rosales died</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Miguel lifted Louis&#8217;s body into his truck and then he drove</em><br />\n<em>To where the morning sunlight fell on a eucalyptus grove</em><br />\n<em>There in the dirt he dug up ten thousand dollars, all that they&#8217;d saved</em><br />\n<em>Kissed his brother&#8217;s lips and placed him in his grave</em></p>\n<p>A life in exchange for ten thousand dollars&#8211;that&#8217;s the price exacted by the North.</p>\n<p>Bruce tells his story in rich detail and plain language without a trace of metaphor. So vivid is his tale, in fact, that we expect to see Louis and Miguel featured in Arax and Gorman&#8217;s original article&#8211;but his story is entirely fictional. &#8220;[Bruce] took things we did and created his own little short story about two brothers,&#8221; Arax told the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> that November.</p>\n<p>Bruce credited the reporters in his album liner notes, and he dedicated the song nightly to his unnamed Arizona biker friend throughout his solo acoustic tour from 1995 to 1997.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Sinaloa Cowboys (live Firenze &#039;97)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/utGY3x0oiLs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;Sinaloa Cowboys&#8221; worked perfectly on the Ghost of Tom Joad Tour.
