I don’t know much about this New York City-based Irish band than what I’ve already typed, but I hope we hear more from them in the future.

They started a Youtube channel five months ago, and their most recent video is a beautiful cover of Bruce’s “.”

Performed by the duo purely on acoustic guitar, mandolin, and harmonica, they perfectly capture the essence of Bruce’s original album arrangement.

This is very, very well done.
