<p>Rather than imitate the band’s cover arrangement, Jory sought out and determined to learn the original, and he posted a work in progress to his Facebook page.</p>

<p>Two years and a week later, in the early days of quarantine, Jory posted a completed take of “Stolen Car” to his YouTube page, and I gotta say: he nailed it.</p>

<p>Performed solo on piano, Jory deeply connects to Bruce’s lyrics. The arrangement may be traditional, but his performance is powerful. His cover of “Stolen Car” ranks among the best I’ve heard.</p>
