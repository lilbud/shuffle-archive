<p>Because in Denmark, Sanne is legendary. With a continuous recording career since 1973 and peak popularity in the mid-eighties, it’s easy to find parallels between Sanne and Bruce. She even has a nickname: “Rock Mama,” because of her leading status in Danish rock.</p>
<p>So it’s a treat to discover that Sanne actually covered one of Bruce’s songs way back on her 1991 album, <em>Where the Blue Begins</em>. And not just any Springsteen song, mind you–Sanne chose a seriously deep cut: “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/10/04/roll-of-the-dice-the-fever/">The Fever,</a>” which Bruce wouldn’t even officially release until 1998. (Southside Johnny covered it much earlier, of course.)</p>

<p>There’s really only one rule when it comes to covering “The Fever.” You can speed it up, slow it down, change the mood, re-arrange it, whatever moves you… as long as you <em>feel</em> it.</p>
<p>And there’s no denying Sanne feels “The Fever.”</p>
<p>The musical arrangement is a bit heavy–definitely of its time–but Sanne’s vocals are the focus here. Cool and controlled through the first half, burning and passionate through the back half, Sanne pulls off a great performance, one of a very small group of covers of one of Bruce’s most under-recognized and under-rated songs.</p>
