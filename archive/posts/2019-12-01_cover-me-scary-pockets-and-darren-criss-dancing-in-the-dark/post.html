<p>If you haven’t discovered Scary Pockets yet, check out their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-2JUs_G21BrJ0efehwGkUw/videos?view=0&amp;sort=dd&amp;shelf_id=0">YouTube channel</a> and prepared to be hooked.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles-based funk band releases new music videos weekly, usually a reinterpretation of a classic song featuring some phenomenal guest vocalists.</p>
<p>Last week’s release featured the multi-talented Darren Criss at the microphone, with what is easily one of the best covers of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/12/25/roll-of-the-dice-dancing-in-the-dark/">Dancing in the Dark</a>” yet.</p>
<p>I know I’ve been going to the “Dancing in the Dark” well pretty often of late, but trust me: watch this one.</p>
<p>Oh, and wait for it…</p>
