If you haven’t discovered Scary Pockets yet, check out their [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-2JUs_G21BrJ0efehwGkUw/videos?view=0&sort=dd&shelf_id=0) and prepared to be hooked.

The Los Angeles-based funk band releases new music videos weekly, usually a reinterpretation of a classic song featuring some phenomenal guest vocalists.

Last week’s release featured the multi-talented Darren Criss at the microphone, with what is easily one of the best covers of “[Dancing in the Dark](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/12/25/roll-of-the-dice-dancing-in-the-dark/)” yet.

I know I’ve been going to the “Dancing in the Dark” well pretty often of late, but trust me: watch this one.

Oh, and wait for it…
