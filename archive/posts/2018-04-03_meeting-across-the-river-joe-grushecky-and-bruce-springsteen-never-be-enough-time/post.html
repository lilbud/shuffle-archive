<p>This isn’t the first time and won’t be the last that I’ll say: Joe Grushecky’s <a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/10/17/american-babylon-a-retrospective/"><em>American Babylon</em> album</a> is a must-own for a serious Springsteen fan. Bruce produced the album, wrote a couple of songs, and plays and/or sings on several.</p>
<p>“Never Be Enough Time” is one of the strongest tracks on the album. It’s also the oldest song on the album, dating back to Joe’s Iron City Houserocker days, and their <em>Cracking Under Pressure</em> album.</p>

<p>Joe significantly reworked the song for American Babylon, and the result is a joy to listen to. We can clearly hear Bruce’s backing vocals throughout, and the two of them sound like they’re having the time of their lives.</p>

<p>Bruce and Joe play the song live together frequently (30 times over the past 24 years), and it’s always a highlight of their shows together. Here’s one of the best, from Light of Day 2010:</p>
