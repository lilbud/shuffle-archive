***New for 2025:** New entry for 1973 and 1977*

**1972:** Bruce makes a guest appearance with Norman Seldin and the Joyful Noyze, of which Clarence Clemons is a member. This is only the third time Bruce has ever performed with Clarence.

**1973:** Bruce, David Sancious, Richard Blackwell, and Suki Lahav layer overdubs onto “[Santa Ana](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/03/06/roll-of-the-dice-santa-ana/)” at 914 Sound Studios in Blauvelt, completing the song. It will remain unreleased for another 25 years.

**1977:** Bruce and the E Street Band hold a recording session for *Darkness on the Edge of Town* at Atlantic Studios in New York City.

**1978:** Bruce and the E Street Band play their second of two nights at Berkeley Community Theater on the Darkness Tour, with Bruce’s parents and sister Pam in attendance. This show is available as part of Bruce’s official archive series–get it [here](https://live.brucespringsteen.net/live-music/0,26627/Bruce-Springsteen---The-E-Street-Band-mp3-flac-download-7-1-1978-Berkeley-Community-Theatre-Berkeley-CA.html). Listen in on the soundcheck below to hear the band working out “New York City Serenade.” Had they played it, it would have been the only performance of the song between the Born to Run Tour and the Reunion Tour.

**1984:** It’s Night Two on the Born in the U.S.A. Tour in St. Paul, and Bruce is still a bit rusty, forgetting the lyrics to both “Jungleland” and “[Open All Night](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/10/28/roll-of-the-dice-open-all-night/).” The latter is understandable, as it’s the very first E Street Band performance of the song, along with the live premiere of “[Reason to Believe](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/02/27/roll-of-the-dice-reason-to-believe/),” “[Nebraska](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/04/16/roll-of-the-dice-nebraska/),” and “[Pink Cadillac](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/08/21/roll-of-the-dice-pink-cadillac/).”

**1989:** Bruce hops on stage with La Bamba at The Stone Pony in Asbury Park to perform “[Long Tall Sally](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/04/19/cover-me-long-tall-sally/).”

**2000:** The Reunion Tour comes to a deeply satisfying close at the legendary tenth night at Madison Square Garden. Bruce plays “[Lost in the Flood](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/02/20/roll-of-the-dice-lost-in-the-flood/)” for the first time in 22 years and closes the show with a re-written “[Blood Brothers](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/12/06/roll-of-the-dice-blood-brothers/)” summarizing Bruce’s feelings about the occasion. According to the *Asbury Park Press*, Bruce also debuts a new song at this show, “Ugo Hearts,” but strangely it will not appear on any of the bootleg recordings. This show is available as part of Bruce’s official archive series (get it [here](https://live.brucespringsteen.net/live-music/0,18239/Bruce-Springsteen---The-E-Street-Band-mp3-flac-download-7-1-2000-Madison-Square-Garden-New-York-NY.html)), and much of it is featured in *Live in New York City* on both audio and video formats.
