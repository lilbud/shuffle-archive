**1975:** Bruce and the E Street Band play their first of two shows at the Houston Music Hall, where they play “[Pretty Flamingo](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/12/04/cover-me-pretty-flamingo/)” for the first time. (The video below is dubbed because the footage is silent, but it’s pretty great quality for a show this old.)

**1985:** At the MTV Video Music Awards, “[I’m on Fire](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/09/11/roll-of-the-dice-im-on-fire/)” wins the award for Best Male Video, and “[Dancing in the Dark](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/12/25/roll-of-the-dice-dancing-in-the-dark/)” wins the award for Best Stage Performance in a Video (but loses to Philip Bailey and Phil Collins’ “Easy Lover” in the Best Overall Performance in a Video category). Little Steven and John Sayles are on hand to accept the award on Bruce’s behalf (ironically, since Little Steven is no longer in the E Street Band).

Why isn’t Bruce there to accept his award? Because he’s on stage with the E Street Band at the Cotton Bowl in Dallas, where “Travelin” Band” makes its tour premiere as the show closer, and Bruce forgets the words to “[Downbound Train](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/01/22/roll-of-the-dice-downbound-train/).”
