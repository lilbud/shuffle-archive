The most notable of these are the ones Bruce transcribed in his &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/?s=1968+notebook\">1968 Notebook</a>,&#8221; many of which I&#8217;ve blogged about here (and the rest of which are topics for later essays). Those early, pre-label compositions feature mostly or fully fleshed-out lyrics, and some even have chord notations.</p>\n<p>But here&#8217;s one that Bruce seems to have abandoned almost as soon as he started. With nothing to go one&#8211;no title, no chords, no date, barely even a verse&#8211;it&#8217;s a curiosity at best.
