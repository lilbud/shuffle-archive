**2009:** Bruce plays his 36th and final show at the Philadelphia Spectrum, performing the *Born in the U.S.A.* album in its entirety–but that's not even close to the show's top highlight. Bruce opens with a true shocker–the first "[The Price You Pay](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/09/23/roll-of-the-dice-the-price-you-pay/)" in 28 years–and wraps the set with a by-request audible of "[(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/09/23/cover-me-your-love-keeps-lifting-me-higher-and-higher/)" that ranks as one of the best performances (IMO, anyway) of the modern era. The tour premiere of "[Save the Last Dance for Me](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/10/25/cover-me-save-the-last-dance-for-me/)" also makes an appearance in the encore, and Vini Lopez makes a guest appearance on "[Spirit in the Night](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/03/01/roll-of-the-dice-spirit-in-the-night/)." This show is available as part of Bruce's official archive series–get it [here](https://live.brucespringsteen.net/live-music/0,17344/Bruce-Springsteen---The-E-Street-Band-mp3-flac-download-10-20-2009-Wachovia-Spectrum-Philadelphia-PA.html).
