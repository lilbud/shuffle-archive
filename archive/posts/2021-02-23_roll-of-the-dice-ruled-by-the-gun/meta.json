Still, we can make out enough of the lyrics to clearly recognize Bruce&#8217;s theme.</p>\n<p>In the outtake above, Bruce sings:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Every where I look I see people crying</em><br />\n<em>Every step I take I see young men dying</em><br />\n<em>On the cathedral steps in the sun</em><br />\n<em>In a world ruled by gun</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>You can build your walls, build &#8217;em high baby</em><br />\n<em>Brick by brick, one by one</em><br />\n<em>Broke your fences in half</em><br />\n<em>Till they reach the sun</em><br />\n<em>In a world ruled by the gun</em></p>\n<p>The cathedral steps reference suggest a linkage to &#8220;Bells of San Salvador,&#8221; but in &#8220;Ruled by the Gun&#8221; Bruce seems to be searching for a song that&#8217;s more universal than about a particular ripped-from-the-headlines tragedy.</p>\n<p>In this next, longer outtake, Bruce&#8217;s lyrics are more confident, and he&#8217;s refining his music as well.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen Ruled By The Gun #3\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-idZxpce7IY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>There&#8217;s a new third verse now, one that seems to almost evoke &#8220;Murder Incorporated.&#8221;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I swore I&#8217;d find a place I could hide</em><br />\n<em>I looked high and low but I couldn&#8217;t find none</em><br />\n<em>In a world ruled by the gun</em></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s possible that &#8220;Bells of San Salvador,&#8221; &#8220;Ruled by the Gun&#8221; and &#8220;Murder Incorporated&#8221; all stem from a single bothersome thread Bruce couldn&#8217;t keep from pulling.</p>\n<p>Only &#8220;Murder Incorporated&#8221; would see an official release, however, and even that would take more than a decade from its original recording. A few years after that, though, another ripped-from-the-headlines gun tragedy captured Bruce&#8217;s attention, and this time he followed the thread all the way to one of his very best songs.</p>\n<p>But that&#8217;s a topic for another day.</p>\n<p><strong>Bonus</strong>: Here&#8217;s an additional outtake of &#8220;Ruled by the Gun.&#8221; No lyrics in this one, just some harmonies and guitar.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen Ruled By The Gun #2 harmonies &amp; guitar solos\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pvJXJPjk9NM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><strong>Ruled by the Gun<br />\nRecorded:</strong> September 1981 &#8211; May 1982 (demos only)<br />\n<strong>Never released</strong><br />\n<strong>Never performed</strong></p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
