Even though the lyrical changes were small, they were significant, possibly shifting the meaning of the song in subtle ways each time.</p>\n<p>The song has at least two and possibly three layers to it: one universal, one personal, and perhaps one political.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s take a listen to the last recording first. Captured by Tinker West at a Bruce Springsteen Band rehearsal at the Challenger Easter Surfboard factory on March 14, 1972, this is a gorgeous soundboard recording. While the band is still officially known as The Bruce Springsteen Band, the musicians you hear playing (Bruce, Steve, Garry, David, and Vini) are very much the E Street Band&#8211;only Danny is missing from the group that only months later would adopt their new name.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Look Towards The Land (1972 rehearsal) [improved audio]\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dY3To2izd3Y?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;Look Towards the Land&#8221; is an exercise in restraint for the band. Bruce holds tight rein in order to make sure that the introspective, romantic lyrics don&#8217;t get lost. The melody is piano-driven, and is very similar to &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/05/12/roll-of-the-dice-mary-queen-of-arkansas/\">Mary, Queen of Arkansas</a>,&#8221; which Bruce would record for his first album later that year.</p>\n<p>Although the song runs a full ten minutes, there&#8217;s not a change-up to be found. Bruce isn&#8217;t showing off here; instead, he&#8217;s expressing the dream of a protagonist who fancies himself an explorer, and adventurer, a gypsy (in other words, a musician)&#8211;but one who&#8217;s torn between his compass and his anchor. The anchor, of course, is a woman&#8211;one he yearns for as a travel companion, although the lack of detail about her implies that he misses the concept of her more than the fact of her.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Well I dreamed I was a gypsy riding the land</em><br />\n<em>With a tambourine and a gypsy queen and a rainbow caravan</em><br />\n<em>Happy old land sailor, that&#8217;s what I wanna be</em><br />\n<em>Stealing diamonds from the rich men to throw in the sea</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Singing look toward the land</em><br />\n<em>&#8216;Cause the land holds the key</em><br />\n<em>Keep an eye on the land</em><br />\n<em>And an eye on the sea</em></p>\n<p>Those last two lines establish the conceit of the song&#8211;the lure of the open road, the pull of home and loved ones.</p>\n<p>But in the two other recorded performances of this song (from the previous year), Bruce exhorts us in the final line of the chorus to keep an eye on &#8220;man&#8221; (which, paired with the concluding chorus, implies that there is a protest song lurking within), or &#8220;me&#8221; (which implies that his mantra is directed at his girl rather than himself). Given that this is the most recent recording we have available, we&#8217;ll assume that this is where Bruce finally landed.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Yes I dreamed I was the cabin boy on an American clipper line</em><br />\n<em>Stealing cargo to colonies of South Caroline</em><br />\n<em>Watering flowers for the captain that they may not wilt</em><br />\n<em>On the best ol&#8217; clipper Donald McKay ever built</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Singing look towards the land</em><br />\n<em>&#8216;Cause the land is the key</em><br />\n<em>Keep an eye on the land</em><br />\n<em>And an eye on the sea</em></p>\n<p>I have to admit: I had to look up Donald McKay to verify if he was a real person, and indeed he was. McKay was a famous clipper shipbuilder, and the fact that Bruce knew this and namechecked him&#8211;combined with the fact that Bruce has made references to <a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/11/30/roll-of-the-dice-garden-state-parkway-blues/\">dreams of clipper ships in other songs</a>&#8211;implies that Bruce had a genuine fascination with clippers, and that this isn&#8217;t just a piece of colorful detail for a song.</p>\n<p>A lovely Clapton-esque guitar solo follows, and then we continue:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Yes I dreamed I was the captain of the river queen</em><br />\n<em>Caressing Mississippi waters down to New Orleans</em><br />\n<em>Just a riverboat captain, that&#8217;s what I wanna be</em><br />\n<em>Won&#8217;t you come on now, I&#8217;d let you ride, my mama, for free</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Singing look towards the river</em><br />\n<em>&#8216;Cause the river&#8217;s the key</em><br />\n<em>Keep an eye on the river</em><br />\n<em>And an eye on the sea</em></p>\n<p>This is where we get our first inkling that our narrator has an actual dilemma on his hands: he&#8217;s drawn to keep moving, but he wants company and implores his love to understand him: he&#8217;s like the river, he needs to flow. To make sure we don&#8217;t miss this as the crux of the song, he sings it twice:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Where the river flows, I&#8217;ll follow</em><br />\n<em>Where the sun shines, I will go</em><br />\n<em>Mama take my hand, I want to bring you to the land</em><br />\n<em>Where the wild wind blows</em><br />\n<em>And the mountains grow</em><br />\n<em>And the people know</em><br />\n<em>Yes they know</em><br />\n<em>You must let the river flow</em><br />\n<em>Let the river go</em></p>\n<p>Bruce now explicitly imagines himself as the river, flowing on:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Yes I dreamed I was a river flowing free</em><br />\n<em>And I dreamed that everybody just flowed naturally</em><br />\n<em>Yes I dreamed I was a crystal mountain stream</em><br />\n<em>Running down the biggest mountain you ever seen</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Singing look towards the river</em><br />\n<em>For they are the key</em><br />\n<em>Keep an eye on the river</em><br />\n<em>And an eye on the sea</em></p>\n<p>Finally, Bruce let&#8217;s go of the metaphor that&#8217;s carried us the entire length of the song, laying it out for his love:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>I dreamed I was your lover &#8217;cause that&#8217;s what I wanna be</em><br />\n<em>I dreamed that every night you dreamed only of me</em><br />\n<em>We walked together by the sea, a hand in hand</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;m telling you were my only woman and I&#8217;d be your only man</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Singing look toward the lovers</em><br />\n<em>For they are the key</em><br />\n<em>Keep an eye on the lovers</em><br />\n<em>And an eye on the war machine</em></p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s talk about that last line for a minute. I&#8217;m not sure what to make of it. The &#8220;war machine&#8221; line comes out of nowhere, and it casts a different light on the song&#8211;as if the force that keeps the singer moving is less wanderlust and more a fear of conscription.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s possible that this was still a holdover from earlier versions of the song, where there were other clues to a more political subtext. In the first recorded performance, a shorter acoustic version from May 1971, Bruce encourages the listener to &#8220;keep an eye on man,&#8221; and he concludes the song with a final couplet:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>And that&#8217;s why at night I&#8217;m afraid to sleep</em><br />\n<em>&#8216;Cause some of my dreams frighten me</em></p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Look Towards the Land by Bruce Springsteen\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/j6Gur5A4Zi8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Five months later, in October 1971, the song sounds very close to the Challenger version at the top of this article. The &#8220;man&#8221; reference has been dropped, but the &#8220;war machine&#8221; is there. Take a listen&#8211;it&#8217;s uploaded here to youtube for the first time:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"The Bruce Springsteen Band - &quot;Look Toward the Land&quot; - Richmond, 1971-10-23\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Imk5QO51SJM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>The fact that the song ends virtually the same way throughout its evolution suggests that Bruce at least had a political context in mind, if not subtext.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, we&#8217;re not likely to ever find out exactly what he had in mind. It&#8217;s closing in on five decades since Bruce last performed it; if Bruce even remembers he ever wrote it, I doubt he&#8217;d remember what he had in mind.</p>\n<p>So like much of his early pre-Street work, we&#8217;ll have to content ourselves with simply listening and taking away from it that which speaks to us.</p>\n<p><strong>Look Towards the Land<br />\n</strong><strong>Recorded:\u00a0</strong>March 14, 1972 (rehearsal)<br />\n<strong>Never released</strong><br />\n<strong>First performed:</strong> May 15, 1971 (Union, NJ)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> October 23, 1971 (Richmond, VA)</p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
