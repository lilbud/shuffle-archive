meta-description: No one could have known that this was Clarence’s final show. But it almost seems like Bruce did, because it’s hard to imagine a more fitting tribute to their friendship.

Way, way, up near the top of my favorite shows list lies this one. Certainly one of the least predictable, absolutely one of the most memorable and (especially in retrospect) emotional.

One of the rules of Springsteen tours is that the penultimate show is almost always way better than the final show of the tour. This show was the exception, and over the last nine years it’s only grown in stature.

Not just because of one of the earliest performances of “” (two years away from official release)…

Not even for his subtle but unmistakable love letter and promise to his fans that opened the encore–an acoustic “.”

And while the final two encores–“” and “Rockin’ All Over the World”–were perfect final notes for the tour, the show had already long since been elevated.

No, none of the above are the reasons why this show will always loom large for me.

Watch the video below–it comes early in the show, during the full album set. Although “” is hardly a rarity, tonight Bruce seemed to be feeling nostalgic, and he did something during the song break that he hadn’t done for decades: he told a story. And not just any story, but the near legendary recollection of the first time he met Clarence Clemons. It’s funny and moving, and then comes the moment where he leans toward Clarence, rests his arm on his shoulder, and recreates the iconic album pose from 34 years prior that first recognized and celebrated their deep friendship and made it one of the most famous in rock and roll.

It was an unexpected and absolutely electrifying moment.

And it felt important. Significant in ways we couldn’t understand at the time, and Bruce almost certainly couldn’t have either. And yet, he did.

It was Clarence’s last public concert appearance with the E Street Band. He died following a stroke in 2011. Bruce couldn’t have known it at the time, but if he had, I think he would have played a show exactly like this one.

Going into the show that night, the rumor and fear among fans was that this was the swan song of the E Street Band–the last show of what would inevitably become known as their last tour. I don’t remember how the rumor started, but I remember believing it and feeling like I absolutely to be there.

*had*

I didn’t know that not only would there be at least three more tours ahead of us, but even four-hour-plus marathon shows that would make setlists like this one pale by comparison.

But it didn’t take long for Bruce to dispel any notion of retirement. Early in the show he promised that the E Street Band was going away “for just a little while” and the encores of “,” “Higher and Higher” and “Rockin’ All Over the World” sent a message and a promise loud and clear: there would be many, many shows to come.

[I’ll Work For Your Love](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/02/14/roll-of-the-dice-ill-work-for-your-love/)

But in a sense, it very much was the end of an era. The next time any of us saw the E Street Band again (other than a select lucky few who witnessed a private promotional concert in late 2010), it would be missing a big piece of its heart and soul.

Like all families, both the band and the fans would mourn, heal, grow, and go on to new heights and unforeseen triumphs.

But at the time, all we knew was that we’d just seen a magical show by our favorite band, and it was our last, we stayed to watch them take their final bows.

*just in case*

Bruce and Clarence took theirs together, and then they walked off into the darkness, arm in arm.
