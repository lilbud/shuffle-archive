<p>On October 23, 1987, the music industry paid tribute to the man who introduced much of the world to Count Basie, Bob Dylan, Aretha Franklin, Benny Goodman, Billy Holliday, Pete Seeger, Bessie Smith, Stevie Ray Vaughn… and Bruce Springsteen.</p>
<p>John Hammond, the man who signed Bruce to Columbia Records, passed away on July 10, 1987, and his loss was deeply felt.</p>
<p>Bruce performed at Hammond’s memorial service at St. Peter’s Church in New York City, and the song he chose to play was fittingly written by “another young fellow that John gave a break to.”</p>

<p>“Forever Young” was a wonderful choice for the occasion, and not just because of its author–the song is a celebration of life, and of a life lived well. For those present, it must have been a moving moment.</p>
<p>Dylan’s original version (there were actually two–an uptempo rocker and a slower lullaby) dates back to his <em>Planet Waves</em> album in 1974.</p>

<p>Since then, many artists have covered the inspirational track, from Diana Ross and Johnny Cash to Meat Loaf and Blake Shelton.</p>
<p>But in 1995, Bruce had a chance to cover it with the songwriter himself when Dylan asked Bruce to join him on stage at the inaugural concert for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Museum. Bruce and Dylan have had a few chances to perform on stage together, but this one will always be my favorite.</p>
