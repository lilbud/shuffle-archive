<p>When it comes to covers, the rule here on the Shuffle is: Do it different, or do it better.</p>
<p>Given that the covered artist is Bruce Springsteen, pretty much every <em>Cover Me</em> entry leans toward the “different” end of the spectrum. Rarely do I encounter a cover that I actually like <em>better</em> than Bruce’s original.</p>
<p>But here’s one.</p>
<p>It’s not surprising (at least not to me) that the track in question comes from <em>Human Touch</em>. That album is full of great songs that go underappreciated, largely due (IMHO) to the album’s over-the-top production. “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/12/29/roll-of-the-dice-cross-my-heart/">Cross My Heart</a>” is one of the rare <em>Human Touch</em> tracks that doesn’t suffer from over-production–it’s actually pretty spare.</p>
<p>It’s also pretty slow.</p>
<p>“Cross My Heart” features some of Bruce’s most graphically sexual lyrics. Musically, though, while the original track sounds like it’s aiming for steamy and sultry, it never gets past a mild, meandering smoulder. The song doesn’t get its due as a result.</p>
<p>Enter The Mandrillos.</p>
<p>I know very little about this three-man combo. I have no idea where they’re from, and their barely-a-year-old social media pages don’t give many clues.</p>
<p>But I do know that they absolutely nail “Cross My Heart,” preserving the original’s bass backbone while taking the pace up a notch and filling in the instrumental breaks with some terrific guitar solos.</p>

<p>I always knew that “Cross My Heart” had the potential to be a solid rocker, and The Mandrillos prove it.</p>
<p>Now if only we could hear what the E Street Band could do with it…</p>
