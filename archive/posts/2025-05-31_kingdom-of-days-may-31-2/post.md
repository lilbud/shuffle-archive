**1973:** Before their evening show opening for Chicago at the Richmond Coliseum, Bruce and the band stop by Alpha Sound Studios in Richmond, Virginia, where they perform only their second-ever radio show, broadcast live on WGOE-FM. The show features an early version of “New York City Serenade” with a completely different melody (and very different lyrics), and a gorgeous “[You Mean So Much to Me](http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/02/16/cover-me-southside-johnny-and-ronnie-spector-you-mean-so-much-to-me/).”

Later that evening, Bruce and the (as yet unnamed) E Street Band open for Chicago at the Richmond Coliseum, where the set list features an ultra-rare “[Secret to the Blues](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2024/09/14/roll-of-the-dice-secret-to-the-blues/).” The local music reviewer is more impressed with the opening act than than the headliner.

The latter two remain unreleased to this day.
