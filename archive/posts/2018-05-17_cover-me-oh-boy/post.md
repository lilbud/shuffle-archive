"Oh Boy!" was originally written and recorded by Sonny West, but it was Buddy Holly and the Crickets' version that broke through to become a hit (peaking at number 10 in the US) and an enduring classic.

Bruce counts Buddy Holly among his big influences, so it's not surprising that Bruce performed "Oh Boy" a few times during the Darkness on the Edge of Town tour.

Here's the last performance from that tour, from the August 4, 1978 show in Charleston, West Virginia.

You're probably familiar with Buddy Holly's version already–so here's the Sonny West original.
