<p>“Oh Boy!” was originally written and recorded by Sonny West, but it was Buddy Holly and the Crickets’ version that broke through to become a hit (peaking at number 10 in the US) and an enduring classic.</p>
<p>Bruce counts Buddy Holly among his big influences, so it’s not surprising that Bruce performed “Oh Boy” a few times during the Darkness on the Edge of Town tour.</p>
<p>Here’s the last performance from that tour, from the August 4, 1978 show in Charleston, West Virginia.</p>
