One month into the Wrecking Ball Tour, the setlists were loosening but still WB-heavy. The new material had fully gelled, and older songs were starting to make their way back into the setlists. And they don't get much older than "[Thundercrack](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/09/24/roll-of-the-dice-thundercrack/)," which made a rare appearance that led up to one of the funniest moments I've seen at a Springsteen show.

Skip ahead if you must to about the 8:30 mark, where Bruce decides–as he often does–to have audience members sing along. Maybe it's unfamiliarity with the song–it never appeared on a studio album other than the *Tracks* box set of outtakes–or maybe he just picked a particularly tone-deaf part of the pit to visit, but each time he holds his mic out, the audience response is cringe-worthy. Bruce keeps his head down, trying hard not to react and casting about again and again for a decent singer... and then blurts out an honest statement that only he could get away with.

Setlist-wise, this wasn't a remarkable show: it was the first show of the tour without any premieres, but there were some Reunion-era gems, including "[Murder Incorporated](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/04/19/roll-of-the-dice-murder-incorporated/)" "[My Love Will Not Let You Down](https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/01/24/roll-of-the-dice-my-love-will-not-let-you-down/)," and "American Skin (41 Shots)," which kept the intensity level high.

I had a nice prime position in the pit for this show, and it proved to be a nice kick-off for my three-show California run. And if this show was lacking in surprises, the next two would certainly make up for it.
