<p>One month into the Wrecking Ball Tour, the setlists were loosening but still WB-heavy. The new material had fully gelled, and older songs were starting to make their way back into the setlists. And they don’t get much older than “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/09/24/roll-of-the-dice-thundercrack/">Thundercrack</a>,” which made a rare appearance that led up to one of the funniest moments I’ve seen at a Springsteen show.</p>
<p>Skip ahead if you must to about the 8:30 mark, where Bruce decides–as he often does–to have <span class="text_exposed_show">audience members sing along. Maybe it’s unfamiliarity with the song–it never appeared on a studio album other than the <em>Tracks</em> box set of outtakes–or maybe he just picked a particularly tone-deaf part of the pit to visit, but each time he holds his mic out, the audience response is cringe-worthy. Bruce keeps his head down, trying hard not to react and casting about again and again for a decent singer… and then blurts out an honest statement that only he could get away with.</span></p>

<p>Setlist-wise, this wasn’t a remarkable show: it was the first show of the tour without any premieres, but there were some Reunion-era gems, including “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/04/19/roll-of-the-dice-murder-incorporated/">Murder Incorporated</a>” “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/01/24/roll-of-the-dice-my-love-will-not-let-you-down/">My Love Will Not Let You Down</a>,” and “American Skin (41 Shots),” which kept the intensity level high.</p>
<p>I had a nice prime position in the pit for this show, and it proved to be a nice kick-off for my three-show California run. And if this show was lacking in surprises, the next two would certainly make up for it.</p>
