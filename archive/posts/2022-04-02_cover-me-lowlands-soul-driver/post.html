<p>Let’s continue our spotlight series on covers of lesser-known Springsteen songs by turning our attention to <em>Human Touch</em> as we celebrate its 30th anniversary this week.</p>
<p><em>Human Touch</em> is full of overlooked gems, largely (I would argue) because its heavy-handed production tends to overpower the songs themselves. And on an album of deep cuts, “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2023/01/22/roll-of-the-dice-soul-driver/">Soul Driver</a>” is one of the deepest.</p>
<p><span class="font_regular">That didn’t stop Italian roots/rock band Lowlands from covering it, though. Early in their decade-long career, they contributed a terrific version of it for the Italian tribute album <em>For You 2.</em> </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KbayqhTOK4">Watch on Youtube: Soul Driver (Remastered) (feat. Chris Cacavas)</a></p>
<p>Lowlands’s version of “Soul Driver” is considerably moodier and broodier than Bruce’s eccentric original, thanks to a folk-tinged arrangement that lends the song a timeless feel. (The original is one of the most dated-sounding songs in Bruce’s catalog.)</p>
<p>The band’s performance builds in power towards the song’s climax, with Chris Cacavas’ gravelly vocals more than up to the challenge of matching Bruce’s passionate delivery on the album track.</p>
<p>The <em>For You</em> albums are great cover collections that fly under-the-radar of most American fans; if you can find them, they’re well worth picking up.</p>
