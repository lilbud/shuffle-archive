On this cold, clear December day in Asbury Park ten years ago, it was a few hundred fans swarming the Carousel House in the freezing cold hoping for a way to get inside for a rare and special performance from Bruce Springsteen and some version of the E Street Band.</p>\n<p><em>The Promise: The Darkness on the Edge of Town Story</em> box set had been released less than a month prior, and the Carousel House event was to be a videotaped performance of songs from the collection.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Racing in the Street (Live At The Carousel, Asbury Park, NJ - 2010)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xlremWeb08o?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Even though the overwhelming majority of folks on the boardwalk knew they wouldn\u2019t be among the 59 people invited inside, there was a party mood outside.\u00a0 People began to gather by noon, and a small crowd had assembled up against the barricade when Bruce arrived in the early afternoon and graciously stopped to chat with fans.\u00a0 Those of us who were lucky enough to be among the invited were ushered inside with no idea what to expect, and we waited in the slightly warmer but still cold abandoned casino while the band rehearsed for quite a long time.</p>\n<p>A lone porta-potty stood among the lumber piles and rubble, and during this time the security and stage crew briefed us over and over that this was a <em>video shoot</em>, not a performance for an audience.\u00a0 \u201cRemember: we don\u2019t <em>need </em>an audience for this \u2013 we can escort you out at any time.\u201d\u00a0 While that seemed a tad harsh, it all made sense when we entered the Carousel House at around 5 pm.</p>\n<p>Each guest was assigned a specific spot to stand, and the same instructions showing us the floor cables and tracks for camera dollies were repeated by several members of the crew.\u00a0 This was both for our own safety and to make sure we all knew to not get in the way of the film crew.</p>\n<p>Much has been written and questioned over the years about the stiffness of the unexcited crowd, so let me dispel the assumptions about that. When we\u2019re at a Bruce show, fans participate so much that we become part of the show. The Promise at the Carousel wasn\u2019t like that&#8211;the guests were observers of a video shoot. We weren\u2019t participants, and it was made very clear to us that if we started swinging from the rafters, we\u2019d be shown the door. It was like being there for an E Street Band rehearsal; why would you interrupt?! That\u2019s not to say, though, that the crowd wasn\u2019t thrilled, in awe, and having a blast, because we were. We weren\u2019t unexcited, we were <em>mesmerized</em>.\u00a0 Having a ringside seat to watch Bruce work out songs and arrangements with the band was truly one of the most wonderful nights I\u2019ve experienced.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - The Promise (Live At The Carousel, Asbury Park, NJ - 2010)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-X3m6mjtFFs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Bruce and the band performed all songs twice, and with the exception of &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/11/29/cover-me-blue-christmas/\">Blue Christmas</a>&#8221; to close, all of the songs were from <em>The Promise</em>.\u00a0 Hearing Bruce\u2019s direction to the band in between takes was as magnificent as the songs themselves.

I leaned into my friend Lowell, pointed at my chest, did my best DeNiro, and mouthed, \u201cYou talkin\u2019 to me?\u201d Bruce looked right at me, pointed, and said, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m talking to you!\u201d\u00a0 I simultaneously laughed and muttered, \u201cPlease don\u2019t throw me out.\u201d</p>\n<p>It took us a while to shake off the instructions to not move or interfere, but eventually we warmed up and came into the circle of musicians when Bruce waved us in. It was a <em>very</em> small space, and only Max, Roy, Charlie, Garry, and the horns were up on risers.\u00a0 It was a bit of a dance to come on in and give Bruce his crowd without bumping into Clarence, Steve, and Garry (when he stepped down).</p>\n<p>I successfully fought off my impulse to grab one of the tambourines. Perhaps the audience\u2019s wonder didn\u2019t come across well on camera, but when we were on that floor, there were countless moments of us looking at each other with wide eyes, and saying without words, \u201cCan you believe this?!!\u201d By \u201c<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/06/02/roll-of-the-dice-aint-good-enough-for-you/\">Ain\u2019t Good Enough For You</a>,\u201d we were all in the groove and rockin\u2019 out with the greatest bar band in the world.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Ain&#039;t Good Enough for You (Live At The Carousel, Asbury Park, NJ - 2010)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z6OCZFzHmiA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Two rounds of \u201c<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/11/29/cover-me-blue-christmas/\">Blue Christmas</a>\u201d was a festive way to end an amazing night, and all of those bopping Santa hats are reflective of the fun and pure joy.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Blue Christmas (Live At The Carousel, Asbury Park, NJ - 2010)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8MGwtwX6IK0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>The room was so beautiful that evening, and hearing those songs played live (twice!) was pure magic.</p>\n<p>As I walked out, I was full of gratitude, knowing we\u2019d just had a genuine once-in-a-lifetime experience.
