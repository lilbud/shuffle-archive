<p><strong>1971: </strong>On a blustery night in Asbury Park, The Bruce Springsteen Band plays their second night of their residency at the Student Prince, while at the nearby Wonder Bar, Norman Seldin and the Joyful Noyze is in session. During an intermission at the Wonder Bar, new Joyful Noyze member Clarence Clemons walks over to the Student Prince to check out the talent. According to legend, the door blows off its hinges when Clarence opens it, leading to a memorable first meeting between Bruce and Clarence. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">(Joyful Noyze photo credit: Billy Smith)</span></p>

<p><strong>1972: </strong>Bruce performs an early solo set on open-mic night at Max’s Kansas City in New York. Local musician David Blue catches Bruce’s performance and invites Bruce to zip downtown with him to catch his set with Jackson Browne at The Bitter End. David introduces Bruce to Jackson, convincing Jackson to let Bruce do an intermission set that night. Bruce plays for about an hour, the start of a career-long friendship with Jackson.</p>
<p>Also on or about this night, Bonnie Raitt plays across the street at the Gaslight Au Go Go, and Bruce joins <em>her</em> on stage for a song as well.</p>
<p><strong>1975: </strong>Bruce drops by Jackson Browne’s show at The Main Point in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, where Bruce had performed an already legendary show earlier that year. Jackson invites Bruce on stage to perform an acoustic version of “Born to Run” and perhaps other songs as well.</p>
