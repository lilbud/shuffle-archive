<p>“Sweet Little Sixteen” was one of Chuck Berry’s greatest hits, peaking at #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.

<p>With that level of cultural influence, it’s no surprise that Bruce covered the song frequently during the seventies and eighties. Here’s one of the best, captured clearly on video, from Bruce’s Darkness show in Largo, MD on August 15, 1978.</p>
