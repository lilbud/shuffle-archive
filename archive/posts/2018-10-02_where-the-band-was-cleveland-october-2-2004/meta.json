Sure, it was all for naught, but boy was it cathartic at the time. Plus, Michael Stipe shook my hand and sang &#8220;The One I Love&#8221; directly to me, kneeling right in front of me and winking.</p>\n<p>Bruce kicked off the evening by welcoming us, but it was just a tease&#8211;and a warning: there would be no BRUUUUUCE-ing that night (at least not for the other performers) or he would slap us silly. He smiled, but he looked like he meant it.</p>\n<p>Bright Eyes opened the event, but honestly I can&#8217;t remember anything at all about Connor&#8217;s performance. I remember not being impressed, so that may be a good thing.</p>\n<p>R.E.M., though&#8211;they had long been on my bucket list of acts to see live, and they were fantastic.
