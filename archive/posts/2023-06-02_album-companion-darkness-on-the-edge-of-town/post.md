Don’t be fooled by the title: Bruce Springsteen’s fourth studio album isn’t dark… it’s just real.

If is unbridled romance, is unvarnished realism.

*Born to Run**Darkness on the Edge of Town*

And that’s easy enough to understand: if you’d just settled a years-long lawsuit with your former manager that barred you from recording new music and forced you into a never-ending hardscrabble tour of secondary towns and tertiary venues, the romance would probably have been beaten out of you too.

is devoid of the romantic imagery and characters that populated Bruce’s previous album, and even the words themselves are tighter, terser, plainer. This is the album where Bruce transitioned away from his rhyming dictionary and vivid scenery and embraced an economical approach to storytelling that would become a trademark going forward.

is significant for more than just its lyrical evolution, however. It’s also the album on which the musical virtuosity of the “classic” line-up of the E Street Band can be heard and appreciated for the first time. Gone is the Spectorian wall of sound production, returning is Springsteen the guitar hero, and for the first time, Bruce’s voice is shaded with the empathy and world-weariness that comes with adulthood.

But don’t confuse realism with pessimism, because the unifying theme and greatest strength of is the relentless optimism, defiance, and persistence of its narrators.

Just as their author refused to compromise his principles and willingly paid the price for his resistance, the characters in refuse to submit to their lot in life. The resulting collection of anthems and ballads seem to seethe, mourn, and concede at first listen but rouse, galvanize, and uplift upon deeper inspection.

And deeper inspection is exactly what we’ve done here over the past four years. With this past weekend’s final installment of our series, our multi-year exploration of the songs that comprise Springsteen’s landmark album is complete. (is the first album to receive the complete treatment, but more will follow over the months to come.)
