<p>I’m kicking off a new blog series with today’s entry. It’s called <em>Spare Parts</em>, because I honestly have no idea how else to classify this clip.</p>
<p>But: it’s seasonal, charming, and good-naturedly funny. So without further ado, here’s Xander Green and Gil Varod’s tale of How the Boss Saved Christmas from December 15, 2018.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOy4FGUUg4I">Watch on Youtube: It's Gonna Be A Bruce Springsteen Christmas</a></p>
<p>Green is obviously a fan: even though his voice isn’t anywhere near a close match for Bruce’s, his vocal patterns and phrasings are knowing, and there are a couple of great piano references to those mid-seventies bootlegs.</p>
<p>So thanks for the chuckle, Xander and Gil, and happy holidays!</p>
