I’m kicking off a new blog series with today’s entry. It’s called *Spare Parts*, because I honestly have no idea how else to classify this clip.

But: it’s seasonal, charming, and good-naturedly funny. So without further ado, here’s Xander Green and Gil Varod’s tale of How the Boss Saved Christmas from December 15, 2018.

Green is obviously a fan: even though his voice isn’t anywhere near a close match for Bruce’s, his vocal patterns and phrasings are knowing, and there are a couple of great piano references to those mid-seventies bootlegs.

So thanks for the chuckle, Xander and Gil, and happy holidays!
