<p>But I’m a sucker for a fresh interpretation of one of Bruce’s songs, and I’m hard pressed to name anyone more inventive with their covers than Silent Bear. (Check out his <a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/01/24/cover-me-silent-bear-tenth-avenue-freeze-out/">funky, improvisational, thirteen-minute cover</a> of “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/11/19/roll-of-the-dice-tenth-avenue-freeze-out/">Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out</a>” to see what I mean.)</p>
<p>Today’s entry is just as creative.</p>

<p>“Lyrically, ‘<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/05/20/roll-of-the-dice-badlands/">Badlands</a>‘ has always been one of my favorites,” Silent Bear explained to me. “If I choose to cover a song, most of the time, I like to challenge myself by coming up with an original arrangement. This was something that popped into my head that I just went with and it worked.  As a solo performance, I wanted the power of the lyric to come through without the support of a large ‘ wall of Sound’ band  arrangement like the original. In retrospect, my arrangement kind of reminds me of some of Bruce’s <em>Nebraska</em> arrangements, raw and blues-driven.”</p>
<p>Raw and bluesy are perfect descriptions of Silent Bear’s 2004 live performance captured above. It preserves both the darkness and the defiance of Bruce’s lyrics while recasting it in a completely new musical light.</p>
