(Check out his <a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/01/24/cover-me-silent-bear-tenth-avenue-freeze-out/\">funky, improvisational, thirteen-minute cover</a> of &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/11/19/roll-of-the-dice-tenth-avenue-freeze-out/\">Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out</a>&#8221; to see what I mean.)</p>\n<p>Today&#8217;s entry is just as creative.</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Badlands by Silent Bear\" width=\"758\" height=\"400\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&#038;url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F1322566231&#038;show_artwork=true&#038;maxheight=1000&#038;maxwidth=758\"></iframe></p>\n<p>&#8220;Lyrically, &#8216;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/05/20/roll-of-the-dice-badlands/\">Badlands</a>&#8216; has always been one of my favorites,&#8221; Silent Bear explained to me. &#8220;If I choose to cover a song, most of the time, I like to challenge myself by coming up with an original arrangement. This was something that popped into my head that I just went with and it worked.\u00a0 As a solo performance, I wanted the power of the lyric to come through without the support of a large &#8216; wall of Sound&#8217; band\u00a0 arrangement like the original. In retrospect, my arrangement kind of reminds me of some of Bruce&#8217;s <em>Nebraska</em> arrangements, raw and blues-driven.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Raw and bluesy are perfect descriptions of Silent Bear&#8217;s 2004 live performance captured above. It preserves both the darkness and the defiance of Bruce&#8217;s lyrics while recasting it in a completely new musical light.</p>\n<p>For more of Silent Bear&#8217;s\u00a0 creative covers and original songs, check out his Soundcloud <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/user-521341814\">here</a>.</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>Singer-songwriter Silent Bear returns with a raw,
