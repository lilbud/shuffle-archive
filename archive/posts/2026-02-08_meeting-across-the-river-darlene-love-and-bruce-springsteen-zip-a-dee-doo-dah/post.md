You might be more familiar with “Zip a Dee Doo Dah” in its original Disney incarnation, but in 1963, it went all the way to #8 on the charts when Bob B. Soxx and The Blue Jeans covered it. And if you’re not familiar with that band, you’re probably familiar with their featured vocalist on the track: Darlene Love.

In 2011, Darlene Love was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and “Zip a Dee Doo Dah” was among the songs she performed at the induction ceremony.

Bruce showed up to play lead guitar for Darlene (and that’s Curtis King on backing vocals)–resulting in one-off performance of an unexpected cover.
