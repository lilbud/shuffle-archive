I can&#8217;t make out most of the lyrics in the first half of the song (the distortion is too loud), but honestly, I&#8217;m not sure it matters. Judging from the back half of the song (which is full of high school rock cliches), this isn&#8217;t one of Bruce&#8217;s deeper compositions.</p>\n<p>Ah, but that guitar solo just past the three-minute mark&#8230; that&#8217;s another story. Bruce had a reputation even then as one of the fastest guitarists on the Jersey Shore, and he reminds us why in this performance.
