# Shuffle Archive

More info can be viewed [here](https://lilbud.github.io/2025/12/11/shuffle-archive/).

This repo contains a work in progress archive of Ken Rosen's "E Street Shuffle" site. Which has announced it will be shutting down in early 2026. Unfortunately, the shut down has started already, and many posts have since been deleted. I've been working on this archive and I believe it predates the start of that process.

The posts themselves can be viewed as markdown in the "export/" folder. Additionally, the raw JSON files can be seen in "posts/". There is also some very rough and poorly written python code which was used to do the bulk of the work. These were responsible for getting the JSON from the sites API, as well as the markdown conversion.

I hope to finalize the format of the markdown files, as well as at some point creating an eBook of the site in some way. Not sure how, so that is TBD. The link to my site at the top contains much more info on the shutdown and my archival efforts.
