Steve and Bruce fully commit themselves to the song, and their sincerity <em>almost</em> carries the day.</p>\n<p>Almost. Because for all its earnestness, &#8220;Native American&#8221; is lyrically and metrically awkward at times, and for me at least, that gets in the way of my appreciation of the song.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Native American\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_2CmMfqwVn8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Despite Bruce&#8217;s participation, &#8220;Native American&#8221; was released only as a B-side (backing &#8220;Trail of Broken Treaties&#8221;) rather than as a featured single. The song never became a hit, despite getting some great exposure in Steve&#8217;s opening sets for U2 on the Joshua Tree stadium tour.</p>\n<p>That didn&#8217;t stop Bruce from joining his friend and (then) ex-bandmate twice on-stage during the summer and fall of 1987, though.</p>\n<p>Amazingly, both performances were captured on video. The first was at The Stone Pony in late August, where a hometown crowd gave them a raucous reception:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen &amp;
