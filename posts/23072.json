Throughout the song, the narrator fights to preserve his window of truth while he is beset by politicians who tell him to trust their windows rather than his own.</p>\n<p>Through a series of vignettes, Bruce rejects the petty pundits, redirecting the conversation to the evils of war, lynching, homelessness and hunger. He&#8217;ll only engage with those who bring empathy, love, and truth to the table, but as the song progresses, our narrator&#8217;s resolve begins to waver as he realizes that his faith won&#8217;t help him make sense of the world. He&#8217;s left to his own devices.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>The sea is pounding at my window</em><br />\n<em>Wants to baptize my mind</em><br />\n<em>There&#8217;s a thousand politicians at my back door</em><br />\n<em>Blinding me with their lies</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Don&#8217;t tell me your problems my friend</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;ve heard them time and time and time and time again</em><br />\n<em>Get on your plastic words and fly</em><br />\n<em>If you don&#8217;t have the truth friend, then I don&#8217;t have the time</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>The earth is trembling beneath me</em><br />\n<em>And I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s to come</em><br />\n<em>The foreign soldier fires his weapon</em><br />\n<em>And a tear runs down the lonely ???</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Don&#8217;t tell me your problems my friend</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;ve heard them time and time and time and time again</em><br />\n<em>Get on your plastic words and fly</em><br />\n<em>If you don&#8217;t have a heart friend, then I don&#8217;t have the time</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I&#8217;ve traveled through the seasons so many times</em><br />\n<em>The saddest sight that I could see</em><br />\n<em>Was the youngest brother being hung</em><br />\n<em>&#8216;Neath the weeping willow tree</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I&#8217;ve sat &#8216;neath that weeping willow tree</em><br />\n<em>Trying to decide wrong from right</em><br />\n<em>The ancient scriptures that lay beside me</em><br />\n<em>Vanished with God into the night</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>The sea is pounding at my window</em><br />\n<em>Should I let it in</em><br />\n<em>There&#8217;s a hungry tramp at my back door</em><br />\n<em>Can I turn my eyes from him</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Don&#8217;t tell me your problems my friend</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;ve heard them time and time and time and time again</em><br />\n<em>Get on your plastic words and fly</em><br />\n<em>If you don&#8217;t have any love friend, then I don&#8217;t have the time</em></p>\n<p>These are not Bruce&#8217;s strongest lyrics (&#8220;get on your plastic words and fly&#8221; doesn&#8217;t exactly roll off the tongue), but remember: he was only eighteen at the time. He was already beginning to experiment with metaphor, and his liberal use of religious vocabulary and iconography was firmly established. This may be a <em>very\u00a0</em> early Bruce Springsteen song, but it does indeed read like a Bruce Springsteen song.</p>\n<p>No recording exists of &#8220;The Window&#8221; (that I know of, at least), but if Bruce truly did perform it on stage that year, perhaps there&#8217;s someone out there who recalls hearing it (or even captured it on tape&#8211;as unlikely as that would be, there are even earlier recordings in circulation).
