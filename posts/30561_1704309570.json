In reality, a full half of the album&#8217;s twelve songs were extant long before he wrote the other six in early 2019. But at least all twelve songs were recorded during a week-long session with the E Street Band that November, right?</p>\n<p>Well&#8230; that might be a bit of a stretch also.</p>\n<p>Because not only is &#8220;Burnin&#8217; Train&#8221; almost thirty years old (it was first demoed during Bruce&#8217;s Los Angeles residency back in 1993), I&#8217;m not sure the official studio track dates entirely from those November 2019 sessions.</p>\n<p>For one thing, Toby Scott carries an engineering credit not just on &#8220;Burnin&#8217; Train&#8221; but also on &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/05/30/roll-of-the-dice-one-minute-youre-here/\">One Minute You&#8217;re Here</a>&#8221; (which dates back to 2003) and &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/02/12/roll-of-the-dice-rainmaker/\">Rainmaker</a>&#8221; (2004)&#8211;and Toby left Bruce&#8217;s employ in 2017.</p>\n<p>And interestingly, there is no footage of &#8220;Rainmaker&#8221; in the <em>Letter to You</em> documentary, and the only video for &#8220;One Minute You&#8217;re Here&#8221; is of Bruce recording his vocals. There&#8217;s some footage of band members recording &#8220;Burnin&#8217; Train&#8221; just before the end credits roll, but it&#8217;s carefully edited enough that the sleuth in me suspects these may be hybrids of older recordings with more recent overdubs.</p>\n<p>One thing is certain, though: &#8220;Burnin&#8217; Train&#8221; certainly doesn&#8217;t <em>sound</em> like the rest of\u00a0<em>Letter to You</em>. Take a listen and hear for yourself.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Burnin&#039; Train (Official Audio)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tTwpR6SCyRw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>A hard-charging, full-on rocker, &#8220;Burnin&#8217; Train has a completely unique sound compared to the rest of its album-mates.

In true &#8220;I had a job, I had a girl&#8221; form, Bruce tells us all we need to know in the first line: <em>Zero&#8217;s my number</em>&#8211;I&#8217;m a loser<em>. Time is my hunter&#8211;</em>I&#8217;m old<em>. </em>Looking for love, he instead finds the rejuvenating power of lust, and it&#8217;s almost literally a religious experience.</p>\n<p>(In the interest of propriety, I&#8217;ll forego my usual line-by-line analysis, but suffice it to say that Bruce is not the first artist to equate <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9APOR1Ls1Bc\">holy water with bodily fluids</a> or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79fzeNUqQbQ\">prayers with orgasms</a>.)</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>White sun burning, black wings beating</em><br />\n<em>I ran my fingers &#8216;cross the hollow of your stomach as you lay breathing</em><br />\n<em>With our shared faith, rising dark and decayed</em><br />\n<em>Take me and shake me from this mortal cage</em><br />\n<em>Take me on your burning train</em></p>\n<p>The second verse holds the key to the song:\u00a0<em>Take me and shake me from this mortal cage</em>.\u00a0<em>Through sex with you, I am young, I am immortal.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Something shining in the light &#8216;neath your breast</em><br />\n<em>The thick smell of you on my chest</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>On your bed of thorns, I brought you shining gifts</em><br />\n<em>Wiped the sweat from your brow and I touched your lips</em><br />\n<em>Sheets stained with sweat, outside the endless rain</em><br />\n<em>Darling I&#8217;m blessed in your blood and marked by Cain</em><br />\n<em>Take me on your burning train</em></p>\n<p>Basking in the afterglow (I trust your ability to interpret Bruce&#8217;s lyrics through the climax), our narrator now bears the mark of Cain, a symbol of God&#8217;s protection against an early death, bestowed upon him through acts of passion.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m sure a Bible scholar would be quick to point out that God bestowed his mark to Cain not as a reward but to make sure that no one else had a chance to kill him while God was punishing him.</p>\n<p>But why quibble? Bruce&#8217;s message is clear:\u00a0 hot sex = long life.</p>\n<p>May you live long and prosper.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"~ Bruce Springsteen - Burnin&#039; Train - Tampa, February 1, 2023 (multicam w/official audio) ~\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/93LbbdUR3xs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><strong>Burnin&#8217; Train<br />\nRecorded:</strong> ? &#8211; 2019<br />\n<strong>Released:\u00a0</strong><em>Letter to You\u00a0</em>(2020)<br />\n<strong>First performed:\u00a0</strong>February 1, 2023 (Tampa, FL)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:\u00a0</strong>March 7, 2023 (Milwaukee, WI)</p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
