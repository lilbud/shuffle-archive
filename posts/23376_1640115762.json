There&#8217;s some nice guitar interplay between Bruce and Steve Van Zandt, but nothing that compares to their more memorable contemporary performances.</p>\n<p>Lyrically, &#8220;Last Night in Tulsa&#8221; is a simple road song of the sort that any touring musician who&#8217;s lingered just a bit too long with a comely companion would appreciate and identify with.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Last night in Tulsa</em><br />\n<em>And I&#8217;m goin&#8217; back home</em><br />\n<em>It&#8217;s my last night in Tulsa</em><br />\n<em>And I&#8217;m goin&#8217; back home</em><br />\n<em>I been in town just one night too long</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>My bags all packed up at the station</em><br />\n<em>Gotta take it on the Tulsa line</em><br />\n<em>My bags all packed up at the station</em><br />\n<em>I gotta take that all out on the Tulsa line</em><br />\n<em>There ain&#8217;t never been a feelin&#8217; so fine</em><br />\n<em>As laying out in some of that warm, warm, warm sunshine</em><br />\n<em>And everything looks surely grand</em><br />\n<em>With that fine little woman of mine</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I remember all them sweet kisses</em><br />\n<em>And I know I&#8217;m gonna miss her</em><br />\n<em>She was fine, that woman of mine</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Last night in Tulsa</em><br />\n<em>And I&#8217;m going back home</em><br />\n<em>It&#8217;s my last night in Tulsa</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;m just tired of travelling right along</em><br />\n<em>I been in this town one night too long</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Last night in Tulsa</em><br />\n<em>My last night in Tulsa</em><br />\n<em>My last night I&#8217;m coming home</em><br />\n<em>Coming home, coming home, coming home</em></p>\n<p>See what I mean? &#8220;Last Night in Tulsa&#8221; is pleasant enough, and I suspect that if I had a clean, clear performance (instead of the distant recording above), I might even listen to it once in a while.</p>\n<p>But it&#8217;s not likely to make any fan&#8217;s favorite list, and even if Bruce seems to be rediscovering his pre-label music of late, I wouldn&#8217;t count on Bruce acknowledging &#8220;Last Night in Tulsa&#8221; any time soon (if ever).</p>\n<p><strong>Last Night in Tulsa<br />\nFirst performed:</strong> July 10, 1971 (Lincroft, NJ)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> July 29, 1971 (South Amboy, NJ)</p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
