Cain, &#8220;Losin&#8217; Kind&#8221; was the bad-luck story of Frank Davis, who picks up a femme fatale against his better judgment, and ends up robbing a Best Western, flees from the police, and ends up wrapping his car around a telephone pole.</p>\n<p>Bruce never released the song, although a similar character named Frank turned up in &#8220;Highway Patrolman,&#8221; which starts so similarly that it forces one to wonder if it&#8217;s another perspective on the same story. But we&#8217;ll delve more into &#8220;Losin&#8217; Kind&#8221; and &#8220;Highway Patrolman&#8221; when the dice turn up those songs.</p>\n<p>I bring up &#8220;Losin&#8217; Kind&#8221; here because &#8220;Highway 29&#8221; is clearly an attempt by Bruce to revisit and perfect that song. The two songs tell the same basic story&#8211;a protagonist realizing too late he has a self-destructive streak, after the match is already lit.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Highway 29\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MmAgTqcYFgg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>In the dozen-plus years between the recordings of &#8220;Losin&#8217; Kind&#8221; and &#8220;Highway 29,&#8221; Bruce&#8217;s songwriting skills advanced considerably. Always cinematic with his lyrics, Bruce became more economical over time.</p>\n<p>In &#8220;Losin&#8217; Kind,&#8221; Frank spends the first verse introducing himself and telegraphing the outcome of the story. In &#8220;Highway 29,&#8221; Bruce wastes no time getting into the story:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>I slipped on her shoe, she was a perfect size seven</em><br />\n<em>I said &#8220;there&#8217;s no smoking in the store ma&#8217;am&#8221;</em><br />\n<em>She crossed her legs and then</em><br />\n<em>We made some small talk, that&#8217;s where it should have stopped</em><br />\n<em>She slipped me a number, I put it in my pocket</em></p>\n<p>When the protagonist succumbs to the mystery woman, Bruce learned to tighten from:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Well we had a few drinks and we danced a while, I pulled her close, she didn&#8217;t mind</em><br />\n<em>And what I knew kinda slipped my mind</em></p>\n<p>to</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>My hand slipped up her skirt, everything slipped my mind</em></p>\n<p>(Bruce had already re-used the original couplet in yet another similar song, &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/11/24/roll-of-the-dice-loose-change/\">Loose Change</a>,&#8221; but that&#8217;s a story for another day.)</p>\n<p>Bruce had also learned to trust the listener: in &#8220;Losin&#8217; Kind,&#8221; Frank described the crime in considerable detail, but in &#8220;Highway 29,&#8221; Bruce invites us to co-write the song, painting the scene but asking us to tell the story.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>It was a small town bank, it was a mess</em><br />\n<em>Well I had a gun, you know the rest</em><br />\n<em>Money on the floorboards, shirt was covered in blood and she was crying</em><br />\n<em>Her and me we headed south on Highway 29</em></p>\n<p>I think that verse is one of Bruce&#8217;s finest&#8211;by this point in his career, Bruce is in such command of his craft that he&#8217;s able to convey the entire story of a bank robbery gone wrong in just four short lines.</p>\n<p>The pair take off on the run, but the nameless narrator knows that things aren&#8217;t going to end well. He also knows it&#8217;s not the woman that&#8217;s leading him astray&#8211;it&#8217;s his own inner demons.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>In a little desert motel, the air was hot and clean</em><br />\n<em>I slept the sleep of the dead, I didn&#8217;t dream</em><br />\n<em>I woke in the morning, washed my face in the sink</em><br />\n<em>We headed into the Sierra Madres &#8216;cross the borderline</em><br />\n<em>The winter sun, shot through the black trees</em><br />\n<em>I told myself it was all something in her</em><br />\n<em>But as we drove I knew it was something in me</em><br />\n<em>Something had been coming for a long long time</em><br />\n<em>And something that was here with me now on Highway 29</em></p>\n<p>(Side note: when I write these essays, I look up the lyrics so I can include them&#8211;and I just now learned that the line is &#8220;&#8230;washed my face in the sink.&#8221; I always thought it was &#8220;&#8230;washed my face in the sand,&#8221; which I thought was both a beautiful detail of life on the run in the desert as well as a metaphor for the narrator trying to scrub himself clean of his sins. Turns out I&#8217;ve always just misheard the line, and Bruce&#8217;s lyric is far more pedestrian. So I keep learning as I write these. (But I like my version better.))</p>\n<p>Bruce uses the same trick for the final verse. In &#8220;Losin&#8217; Kind,&#8221; Bruce details the car crash and its aftermath, with a police officer&#8217;s admonishment. In &#8220;Highway 29,&#8221; Bruce again just paints the littered landscape:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>The road was filled with broken glass and gasoline</em><br />\n<em>She wasn&#8217;t saying nothing, it was just a dream</em><br />\n<em>Wind come silent through the windshield</em><br />\n<em>All I could see was snow and sky and pines</em></p>\n<p>We never find out what happens next, whether the pair lives or dies, whether they&#8217;re caught or free. The narrator simply escapes into his own mind as Bruce&#8217;s guitar takes us ever further down the road.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>I closed my eyes and I was running</em><br />\n<em>And I was running then I was flying</em></p>\n<p>In concert, &#8220;Highway 29&#8221; was a staple on the Ghost of Tom Joad tour, and it made several appearances on the Devils and Dust Tour as well. It hasn&#8217;t been performed since, though, and it has never been performed with any band or musician.</p>\n<p>On vinyl and on stage, &#8220;Highway 29&#8221; is always a solo Bruce Springsteen performance.</p>\n<p><strong>Highway 29</strong><br />\n<strong>Recorded:</strong> 1995<br />\n<strong>Released:</strong> <a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2023/06/03/album-companion-the-ghost-of-tom-joad/\"><em>The Ghost of Tom Joad</em> </a>(1995)<br />\n<strong>First performed:</strong> November 21, 1995 (New Brunswick, NJ)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> November 8, 2005 (Philadelphia, PA)</p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
