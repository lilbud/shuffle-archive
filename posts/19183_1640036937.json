Is it The Starlets? Patti LaBelle&#8217;s lead vocals and The Starlets on backing vocals? Just the Blue-Belles against the original backing track?</p>\n<p>No one seems to know for sure, or at least they&#8217;re not saying. The fact that The Starlets re-recorded their own version is of little help&#8211;their version sounds very close to the more well-known version.</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s less of a mystery is the beautiful girl Bruce refers to in his introduction to his one-and-only cover of this controversial song in 1974. She&#8217;s most likely the &#8220;drug-taking, hell-raising wild child who played by nobody&#8217;s rules&#8221; that Bruce &#8220;fell in obsession&#8221; with a few years earlier and wrote about in his autobiography four decades later.</p>\n<p>Or as he put it in\u00a0<em>Western Stars: </em>&#8220;I had a gal in New Jersey who broke my heart, ripped it to shreds, trampled on it, and sent it to me C.O.D. in a paper bag.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Now, I don&#8217;t know why Bruce was thinking about her that day in 1974, nor do I know why Bruce picked that night to cover an obscure jazz standard turned controversial girl group R&amp;B hit.</p>\n<p>But cover it he did, and the band&#8217;s unique arrangement (which draws from both the 1940s and 1960s versions) and polished performance strongly argues against it being an audible.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - I SOLD MY HEART TO THE JUNKMAN 1974  (audio)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/M99gSHyVVCE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>That performance was clearly planned and rehearsed, and it turned out great.

It was the earlier of two shows that night, which means Jon Landau missed Bruce&#8217;s one-time-only performance. Landau only attended the late show that night, and while there&#8217;s no audio from that show, it&#8217;s clear that Bruce must have put on quite a performance&#8211;because Landau would write a review of it leading with the words &#8220;I saw rock and roll future and its name is Bruce Springsteen.&#8221;)</p>\n<p><strong>I Sold My Heart to the Junkman<br />\nFirst performed:</strong> May 9, 1974 (Cambridge, MA)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> May 9, 1974 (Cambridge, MA)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>Who made &#8220;I Sold My Heart to the Junkman&#8221; famous, and what made Bruce cover it one night in 1974?
