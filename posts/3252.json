And while Bruce&#8217;s &#8220;Trapped&#8221; cover was a departure from the original, for &#8220;Many Rivers to Cross,&#8221; Bruce chose a more faithful arrangement.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s Jimmy&#8217;s original 1969 version, written and recorded at the age of 21. It&#8217;s the song of a frustrated would-be artist striving to keep his faith in himself and his will to persist, even when those around him abandon him and basic subsistence becomes a struggle.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Jimmy Cliff - Many Rivers To Cross (Lyrics on screen)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QvBEpwcGM2o?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Bruce&#8217;s version retains the soulfulness of Jimmy&#8217;s original arrangement&#8211;if anything, he ratchets it up, adding a gospel element with his backing singers.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, though, Bruce alters the lyrics&#8211;most notably by completely dropping the final verse in which the protagonist is so desperate that he&#8217;s tempted into &#8220;committing some dreadful crime.&#8221; Bruce also changes the narrator&#8217;s reaction to his woman leaving him from &#8220;Well, I guess I have to try&#8221; to &#8220;All I can do now is cry.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Many Rivers To Cross - Bruce Springsteen con subt\u00edtulos en espa\u00f1ol\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/UuCzgtKoqos?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>The result of the lyrical changes: a more traditional ballad of lost love than a down-on-his-luck musician. Why make the change? Who knows&#8211;maybe it was more in keeping with the relationships theme of the 1992-93 tour; maybe Bruce felt he&#8217;d have more authenticity this way. Or maybe this aspect of the song resonated more with him.</p>\n<p>Regardless, it remains a World Tour 1993 highlight. Bruce played it only one time since, at SxSW in 2012 with the original artist. Here&#8217;s Bruce and Jimmy performing it together (with the original lyrics) for the first and only time.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen and Jimmy Cliff - Many Rivers to Cross 03/15/2012\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zEMwQVGIcW0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer;
