On September 16, 1967, at The Left Foot in Freehold, a band called The Castiles played &#8220;Steve&#8217;s Song&#8221; early in their set.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Steve&#8217;s Song&#8221; was still new at the time&#8211;it had only been released on album ten months earlier&#8211;but that didn&#8217;t deter the young band from taking a run at it. Miraculously, that performance was captured on tape, in decent quality.</p>\n<p>On lead vocals you&#8217;ll hear Castiles co-founder George Theiss, but on guitar you&#8217;ll hear <em>seventeen-year-old</em> Bruce Springsteen.
