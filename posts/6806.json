Because many of the songs were transcribed on the same date, it&#8217;s extremely likely that the songs were written earlier, and that Bruce copied them into the notebook for safekeeping. Given the date of transcription (April 26, 1968), it&#8217;s not at all out of the question that Bruce might have written the songs months earlier, perhaps even at seventeen.</p>\n<p>Regardless: he was young, and he still had a long way to go toward refining his craft. He&#8217;s not very adventurous with metaphor, and the rhyme scheme of the verses are consistent (although whether intentional or not (I&#8217;m inclined to credit it), there&#8217;s a clever almost rhyme between the third lines for the first two verses.)</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>As my mind bends clouds into dreams that I like</em><br />\n<em>As the sun disappears into the night</em><br />\n<em>I look and you have gone</em><br />\n<em>Then I hear you calling to me in the distance</em><br />\n<em>Yet can&#8217;t you see I&#8217;m resisting the whisperings of your mind</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>And as the cry of war racks my brain</em><br />\n<em>I realize men don&#8217;t love the same</em><br />\n<em>Maybe I&#8217;ll make it to the summer rain</em><br />\n<em>Or maybe I&#8217;ll lose my mind insane trying</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>The paper flag flies high over the soldiers grave</em><br />\n<em>Let&#8217;s see what mistake the young boy made</em><br />\n<em>Was his life really done</em><br />\n<em>In another land a flower drips in the morning dew</em><br />\n<em>It&#8217;s been thousands of years since I&#8217;ve seen you, you know that it&#8217;s true</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>And as the cry of war racks my brain</em><br />\n<em>I realize men don&#8217;t love the same</em><br />\n<em>Maybe I&#8217;ll make it to the summer rain</em><br />\n<em>Or maybe I&#8217;ll lose my mind insane trying</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>I&#8217;m walking down by the banks of the river</em><br />\n<em>My heart is lonely, she flows by you to whisper</em><br />\n<em>Then I see you standing there</em><br />\n<em>The gypsy tells the future of a dying man</em><br />\n<em>Yet he&#8217;ll never understand what he&#8217;s dying for</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>And as the cry of war racks my brain</em><br />\n<em>I realize men don&#8217;t love the same</em><br />\n<em>Maybe I&#8217;ll make it to the summer rain</em><br />\n<em>Or maybe I&#8217;ll lose my mind insane trying</em></p>\n<p>Bruce is believed to have played &#8220;Clouds&#8221; during some of his acoustic shows in 1968, but we don&#8217;t have any definitive recording or setlist to testify to it.
