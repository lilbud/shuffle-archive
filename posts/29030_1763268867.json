Undersea cowboys is <em>high concept</em>, folks!</p>\n<p>Yes, there&#8217;s a concluding verse that touches on environmental and possibly class-conflict themes, but it arrives too late for me to consider it anything but an afterthought. This song is all about the undersea cowboys.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well, they ride beneath the waves at twenty-thousand leagues</em><br />\n<em>On stallions stitched to seaweed strands, so smiling, so smiling</em><br />\n<em>They herd the fishes of the deep, they ride for you and me</em><br />\n<em>They ranch the rich and the sunken soil at the bottom of the sea</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>And in the dead of night, alive in sleep I hear them calling me</em><br />\n<em>Them deep sea desperadoes, them midnight maelstrom freaks, the cowboys of the sea</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>So on wings of sleep I pierce the deep and ride like a hurricane</em><br />\n<em>In midnight still I paid my bill, I turned my back on the land</em><br />\n<em>With the help of Old Paint, that seaweed nag, it&#8217;s just Jesse James and me</em><br />\n<em>We ride the depths and we rob the banks with the cowboys of the sea</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>With a seaman&#8217;s grip on navigation and some fired, hired hands</em><br />\n<em>Whoa, we set forth to confront the nation and lend a cowboy&#8217;s hand</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>We do the dolphin&#8217;s dance duet, my mermaid babe and me</em><br />\n<em>Then I ride off into the blue sunset at the bottom of the sea</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Whoa, and with the seaman&#8217;s grip on submarining and some aqualung outlaws</em><br />\n<em>Our guns are made of solid dreaming and bullets of the cause</em><br />\n<em>Whoa, and with hand held high to touch the sky a good Texas Ranger I&#8217;ll be</em><br />\n<em>But sometimes I feel like a lone stranger &#8216;midst the cowboys of the sea</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Oh, and man above he just can&#8217;t make love, he&#8217;s gotta rape his mother the sea</em><br />\n<em>Because of his greed we&#8217;re a vanishing breed, we cowboys of the sea</em><br />\n<em>With the cowboys of the sea</em></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s easy to understand why Bruce was so taken with his song; it&#8217;s equally easy to understand why those around him did their best to distract him from it. The concept is clever, but the lyrics are clunky. (There a few neat internal rhymes, a device to which Bruce was quickly warming, but nothing as noteworthy or as artful as those he&#8217;d write shortly after.)</p>\n<p>The song is stronger musically, but if the acoustic arrangement sounds familiar, that&#8217;s because it&#8217;s a prototype for what would eventually make the album as &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/02/20/roll-of-the-dice-lost-in-the-flood/\">Lost in the Flood</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The full-band version is more noteworthy. It&#8217;s one of those Steel Mill holdover arrangements that feels ill-suited for The Bruce Springsteen Band (Sancious gets a workout, but not a challenge), and the unrivaled highlight of the track is Bruce&#8217;s&#8217; blisteringly, jaw-droppingly fast mid-song guitar solo. It&#8217;s an instructive example for those who wonder how Bruce had earned his reputation as the fastest guitar-slinger on the Jersey Shore.</p>\n<p>In the end, &#8220;Cowboys of the Sea&#8221; is little more than a footnote in Bruce&#8217;s recording history, but it&#8217;s a clever asterisk for a young songwriter honing his craft with what would prove to be a couple of his favorite themes.</p>\n<p><strong>Cowboys of the Sea<br />\nRecorded:</strong> April &#8211; July 1972<br />\n<strong>Never released</strong><br />\n<strong>First performed:</strong> February 4, 1972 (Richmond,
