Bruce, however, has been a fan of Ness&#8217; band Social Distortion since the early &#8217;90s. (&#8220;How did this guy even hear of us?&#8221; Ness once wondered to an interviewer.)</p>\n<p>Today, Bruce and Mike are friends and influence each other, and they&#8217;ve each graced the other&#8217;s stage. And one time (so far), they even collaborated in the studio.</p>\n<p>When Ness recorded his first solo album,&nbsp;<em>Cheating at Solitaire</em>, in 1999, Bruce was one of several musicians Mike asked to join him on record. The result: A raging rocker called &#8220;Misery Loves Company,&#8221; featuring Bruce prominently on vocals and guitar.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Mike Ness -  Misery Loves Company\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cI5uK1BHuSM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>As for why Bruce took to this particular song&#8230; well, looking at the lyrics, it&#8217;s not hard to see the resonance:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px\"><em>I used to think that I was a king</em><br />\n<em>Fancy cars, fancy clothes and diamond rings</em><br />\n<em>Yeah but happiness it&#8217;s a funny thing</em><br />\n<em>And misery just loves company</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px\"><em>Don&#8217;t even try to understand what goes on inside this man</em><br />\n<em>As a boy I used to dream &#8217;cause sometimes life ain&#8217;t what it seems&#8230;</em></p>\n<p>In May of 2008&#8211;almost a decade after the song&#8217;s release&#8211;Ness played a show at The Stone Pony in Asbury Park, and Bruce showed up to join him on stage for four songs, including their one and only collaboration. But sadly no recording circulates from that performance, so fans of both artists had to wait for more than another decade to get another chance to catch &#8220;Misery Loves Company&#8221; by the original artists.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, that last performance (At Sea. Hear. Now. in September 2018) not only was captured, it&#8217;s easy to find in several great video versions, including this one.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Misery Loves Company - Social Distortion with Bruce Springsteen - Sea Hear Now\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/loIfsQ8RmAc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><strong>Misery Loves Company<br />\nRecorded:</strong> December 29, 1998<br />\n<strong>Released:</strong>&nbsp;<em>Cheating at Solitaire</em> (1999)<br />\n<strong>First performed</strong>: May 17, 2008 (Asbury Park, NJ)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> September 30, 2018 (Asbury Park, NJ)</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>Mike Ness has played with Bruce on stage on several occasions, but they only collaborated in the studio once.
