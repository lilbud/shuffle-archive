I think.</p>\n<p>We gotta give Bruce some points though: first, because he anticipated the request and worked it up at soundcheck; second for taking a chance with an unusual arrangement; and third for never once wavering in his commitment.</p>\n<p>The occasion was captured in terrific audio and HD multi-cam quality, so enjoy Bruce Springsteen and The E Street Band covering Bobby Pickett&#8217;s 1962 novelty hit, &#8220;Monster Mash,&#8221; for the first and only time.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen Monster Mash Rochester, NY 10-31-2012 with Intro\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2B-9GgbK9dk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Yeah, that reggae arrangement doesn&#8217;t really do the song any favors. Bruce realizes it a couple of minutes into the song but does his game best to carry it to conclusion.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, though, he compensates with shtick. He obviously didn&#8217;t rehearse that Transylvania accent, and that ad libbed &#8220;Boss Man&#8221; reference caught the band so off-guard that more than one back-up singer stepped on his line.</p>\n<p>Still, it was great fun&#8211;and isn&#8217;t that the point of a novelty song?\u00a0 And when it comes to hamming it up to &#8220;Monster Mash,&#8221; it&#8217;s pretty tough to beat the original artist:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bobby Pickett &quot;Monster Mash&quot;\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vNuVifA7DSU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;Monster Mash&#8221; was a huge hit around Halloween when it was originally released, and it&#8217;s been a seasonal favorite ever since&#8211;so maybe it&#8217;s not out of the question for Bruce to give it another shot someday.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s just hope he chooses a different arrangement.</p>\n<p><strong>Monster Mash<br />\nFirst performed:</strong> October 31, 2012 (Rochester, NY)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> October 31, 2012 (Rochester, NY)</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>One time only (thankfully): Bruce and The E Street Band re-imagine &#8220;Monster Mash&#8221; as a reggae song.
