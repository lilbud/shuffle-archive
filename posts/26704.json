(It would be a long time before I learned that &#8220;Bad Day&#8221; was the inspiration for rather than a repetition of &#8220;It&#8217;s the End of the World.&#8221;) Nevertheless, the song went to number one on the Billboard Adult Alternative chart.</p>\n<p>When R.E.M. joined Bruce Springsteen on tour in 2004 as part of the Vote for Change initiative, &#8220;Bad Day&#8221; was still finishing its first year as an officially released song, so it&#8217;s not surprising that the band added it to their set list.
