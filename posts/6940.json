He was right.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Elliott Murphy  Ft.

But when Bruce took the song into his home studio, recorded his contribution and sent it back, Elliott was surprised but delighted to discover that Bruce had recorded lead vocals for an entire verse. And honestly, how could he resist:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Well, I&#8217;m a man without a place</em><br />\n<em>Sometimes afraid to show my face</em><br />\n<em>Hear me humming in the night</em><br />\n<em>When you turn out the light</em><br />\n<em>They can blow my tires out</em><br />\n<em>&#8216;Til I&#8217;m filled up with nothing else but doubt</em><br />\n<em>Still, I&#8217;m rolling on my rims</em><br />\n<em>Oh baby, coming back to you again.</em></p>\n<p>That Murphy is clever like a fox. Put a verse like that in front of Bruce and odds are pretty good he&#8217;s gonna sing it. Now Elliot had a genuine Springsteen duet on his hands.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Everything I Do (Leads Me Back to You)&#8221; garnered neither widespread attention nor acclaim upon it&#8217;s release, but it remains a lovely under-the-radar track with two beautiful vocal performances.</p>\n<p><strong>Everything I Do (Leads Me Back to You)<br />\nRecorded:</strong> mid-1995<br />\n<strong>Released:\u00a0</strong><em>Selling the Gold\u00a0</em>(1995)<br />\n<strong>Never performed live</strong></p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>Here&#8217;s a lovely under-the-radar duet featuring one of Bruce&#8217;s best 90s vocals and a verse he couldn&#8217;t resist.</p>\n", "protected": false}, "author": 1, "featured_media": 7014, "comment_status": "open", "ping_status": "open", "sticky": false, "template": "", "format": "standard", "meta": {"_monsterinsights_skip_tracking": false, "_monsterinsights_sitenote_active": false, "_monsterinsights_sitenote_note": "", "_monsterinsights_sitenote_category": 0, "jetpack_post_was_ever_published": false, "_jetpack_newsletter_access": "", "_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs": false, "_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id": 0, "_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content": false, "_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content": false, "footnotes": "", "jetpack_publicize_message": "", "jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled": true, "jetpack_social_post_already_shared": true, "jetpack_social_options": {"image_generator_settings": {"template": "highway", "default_image_id": 0, "font": "", "enabled": false}, "version": 2}}, "categories": [5], "tags": [761, 2102], "class_list": ["post-6940", "post", "type-post", "status-publish", "format-standard", "has-post-thumbnail", "hentry", "category-meeting-across-the-river", "tag-elliott-murphy", "tag-everything-i-do-leads-me-back-to-you"], "aioseo_notices": [], "jetpack_publicize_connections": [], "jetpack_featured_media_url": "https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/everything.jpg?fit=300%2C300&ssl=1", "jetpack_sharing_enabled": true, "jetpack_shortlink": "https://wp.me/p9w3Lk-1NW", "jetpack_likes_enabled": true, "jetpack-related-posts": [{"id": 28866, "url": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/08/24/matr-elliot-murphy-and-bruce-springsteen-rock-ballad/", "url_meta": {"origin": 6940, "position": 0}, "title": "MatR: Elliott Murphy and Bruce Springsteen: Rock Ballad", "author": "Ken", "date": "August 24, 2021", "format": false, "excerpt": "One time only: Bruce invites Elliott Murphy on stage for an acoustic duet of Elliott's 1977 \"Rock Ballad.\"", "rel": "", "context": "In &quot;Cover Me&quot;", "block_context": {"text": "Cover Me", "link": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/category/cover-me/"}, "img": {"alt_text": "", "src": "https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/murphy.png?fit=647%2C630&ssl=1&resize=350%2C200", "width": 350, "height": 200, "srcset": "https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/murphy.png?fit=647%2C630&ssl=1&resize=350%2C200 1x, https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/murphy.png?fit=647%2C630&ssl=1&resize=525%2C300 1.5x"}, "classes": []}, {"id": 33512, "url": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/03/29/matr-elliott-murphy-and-bruce-springsteen-diamonds-by-the-yard/", "url_meta": {"origin": 6940, "position": 1}, "title": "MatR: Elliott Murphy and Bruce Springsteen: Diamonds by the Yard", "author": "Ken", "date": "March 29, 2022", "format": false, "excerpt": "One time only: Elliott Murphy joins Bruce on stage in Paris for an acoustic duet on Elliott's 1976 epic.", "rel": "", "context": "In &quot;Cover Me&quot;", "block_context": {"text": "Cover Me", "link": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/category/cover-me/"}, "img": {"alt_text": "", "src": "https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/diamonds.jpg?fit=1200%2C675&ssl=1&resize=350%2C200", "width": 350, "height": 200, "srcset": "https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/diamonds.jpg?fit=1200%2C675&ssl=1&resize=350%2C200 1x, https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/diamonds.jpg?fit=1200%2C675&ssl=1&resize=525%2C300 1.5x, https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/diamonds.jpg?fit=1200%2C675&ssl=1&resize=700%2C400 2x, https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/diamonds.jpg?fit=1200%2C675&ssl=1&resize=1050%2C600 3x"}, "classes": []}, {"id": 8423, "url": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/04/11/matr-john-eddie-and-bruce-springsteen-bang-a-gong-get-it-on/", "url_meta": {"origin": 6940, "position": 2}, "title": "MatR: John Eddie, Bruce Springsteen, and Friends: Bang a Gong (Get It On)", "author": "Ken", "date": "April 11, 2019", "format": false, "excerpt": "One time only: Bruce Springsteen, John Eddie, Greg Kihn, Marshall Crenshaw, and Elliott Murphy team up on the T.
