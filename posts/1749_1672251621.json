As I like to put it: a good place to be <em>from</em>.</p>\n<p>I escaped to the Pacific Northwest half my life ago, but as long as Bruce continues to tour, I&#8217;ll keep going back. (Also, I have family there.)</p>\n<p>Pretty much every Springsteen show is great. But in some cities, you&#8217;re more likely than not to get the jaw-dropping, rarities-filled setlists that fans dream of. And in Philadelphia, you&#8217;re pretty much guaranteed it: Philly is consistently and reliably the site of legendary Bruce shows dating back well before &#8220;Born to Run.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This show certainly fit that mold. It started out normally enough, with a standard &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/05/20/roll-of-the-dice-badlands/\">Badlands</a>&#8221; opener kicking off the usual WOAD opening pack and recession-themed mini-set. But then came sign-collection time, and we were off to the races.</p>\n<p>First, a rare outing of &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/08/05/roll-of-the-dice-fire/\">Fire</a>&#8221; in response to a sign deserving of attention&#8230;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Fire - Live from Philadelphia - Working On A Dream Tour - 2009\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0kTnyP33fbM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Reliving that moment as I write this, it&#8217;s so wonderful to see Bruce and Clarence share the mic and enjoy each other&#8217;s company&#8230; we didn&#8217;t know at the time that our remaining opportunities to see moments like that were so limited.</p>\n<p>Next, the song I&#8217;d always chased&#8211;the song at the very top of my as-yet-unheard-but-must-hear-someday mountain: &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/10/04/roll-of-the-dice-the-fever/\">The Fever</a>.&#8221; Bruce plays it so rarely in concert (other than at special bar sets and benefits, he&#8217;d played it only twice in 30 years), I&#8217;d resigned myself to it being forever out of reach.

He sent us home with a raucous &#8220;Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)&#8221; that left us exhausted but exhilarated for <a
