Each morning before dawn, our hero races back to his girl, racing down a deserted New Jersey turnpike across a state so quiet and empty it&#8217;s &#8220;like a lunar landscape.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Working the night shift all alone, driving that lonely road&#8211;it&#8217;s enough to make a man feel like he&#8217;s almost disconnected from the world, living on its very edge.</p>\n<p>That pretty much the song. Both songs. Some details get longer or shorter shrift, but in essence they&#8217;re the same.</p>\n<p>Some verses appear in complete form in both songs:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Early North Jersey industrial skyline</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;m a all-set cobra jet creeping through the night time</em><br />\n<em>Gotta find a gas station, gotta find a pay phone</em><br />\n<em>This turnpike sure is spooky at night when you&#8217;re all alone</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Now the boss don&#8217;t dig me, so he put me on the night shift</em><br />\n<em>It takes me two hours to get back to where my baby lives</em><br />\n<em>In the wee wee hours your mind gets hazy</em><br />\n<em>Radio relays towers, won&#8217;t you lead me to my baby</em><br />\n<em>Underneath the overpass, trooper hits his party light switch</em><br />\n<em>Good night good luck, one two power shift</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Radio&#8217;s jammed up with gospel stations</em><br />\n<em>Lost souls calling long distance salvation</em><br />\n<em>Hey mister deejay won&#8217;t you hear my last prayer</em><br />\n<em>Hey ho rock &#8216;n roll deliver me from nowhere</em></p>\n<p>Others vary a bit:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Radio, radio, hear my tale of heartbreak</em><br />\n<em>New Jersey in the morning like a lunar landscape\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>&#8230;and some details (like the name and employer of the aforementioned girl) differ.</p>\n<p>But even when the lyrics identical, they&#8217;re often all out of order. In fact, if you listen carefully to the November 1979 rehearsal sessions below (it&#8217;s hard to make out the vocals, but if you concentrate, you can), you&#8217;ll realize that Bruce was constantly swapping around the order of lines and verses, suggesting that &#8220;Living on the Edge of the World&#8221; is less of a narrative and more of a portrait (or perhaps the stream-of-consciousness late-night rambling we might all fall victim to in the same circumstances).</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen Living On The Edge #1\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hshkgRrbZIs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen Living On The Edge #2\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yMVAp21uWZ8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen Living On The Edge #3\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RSIt_ZWG4nY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>See what I mean?</p>\n<p>Except it&#8217;s not just &#8220;Open All Night&#8221; that intermingles its lyrics with &#8220;Living on the Edge of the World.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Both:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Down past the refinery towers where the great black river flows</em></p>\n<p>and</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>In the wee wee hours my mind gets hazy</em><br />\n<em>Relay towers, won&#8217;t you lead me to my baby</em></p>\n<p>appear in &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/12/22/roll-of-the-dice-state-trooper/\">State Trooper</a>&#8221; as well, along with references to radio stations jammed with gospel (&#8220;Living&#8221;) or talk show (&#8220;State Trooper&#8221;) stations.</p>\n<p>But even <em>that&#8217;s</em> not all&#8211;check out this 1981 home demo of &#8220;Living on the Edge of the World.&#8221; (yes, Bruce was\u00a0<em>still</em> working on the song two years later, although by now it had a new name, &#8220;Open All Night,&#8221; which makes the latter song arguably the &#8220;finished&#8221; version of the former (I prefer to think of them as different songs, though)).</p>\n<p>Once you get past the &#8220;Nebraskafication&#8221; of the song, pay careful attention to the last verse&#8230;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Open All Night (early version)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jF4Ju9wu7EI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Mister, can you tell me what happened to the seeds</em><br />\n<em>What happened to the seeds I&#8217;ve sown</em><br />\n<em>Yeah, where they fall from my hand</em><br />\n<em>And they fell on the ground of this hard land</em></p>\n<p>Yep&#8230; that&#8217;s right: now we have &#8220;Open All Night,&#8221; &#8220;State Trooper,&#8221; and &#8220;This Hard Land,&#8221; all spinning out of one song: &#8220;Living on the Edge of the World.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If it wasn&#8217;t for that crazy instrumental track, we&#8217;d probably consider &#8220;Living on the Edge of the World&#8221; just a curious historical artifact, but it&#8217;s just so darn crazily and addictively compelling that it stands on its own.</p>\n<p>The bootleg rehearsals above had been circulating for a while with unclear vocals, but Bruce finally released the song &#8220;officially&#8221; on his\u00a0<em>Tracks</em> boxset compilation in 1998. The song got a second release in 2015 when it was included with\u00a0<em>The Ties That Bind: The River Collection</em> box set that documented the sessions and outtakes that surrounded that classic album.</p>\n<p>But &#8220;Living on the Edge of the World&#8221; has only been performed once*&#8211;when Bruce opened with it(!) at MetLife Stadium on the Wrecking Ball Tour. That was a true one-off, head-turning moment (it even throws Bruce and the band toward the end), and you can watch it for yourself below:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Living on the Edge of the World - Metlife Stadium -  9-21-12\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fwmwfjZdrKA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>*Technically, Bruce has only performed &#8220;Living on the Edge&#8221; that one time in 2012&#8230; at least that&#8217;s the only time he&#8217;s played it in full with its own melody.</p>\n<p>But here&#8217;s a bonus: check out this genuine one-off historical curiosity.
