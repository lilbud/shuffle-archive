The melody is identical, as is the theme. If it weren&#8217;t for the fact that Bruce rewrote the entire set of lyrics, we&#8217;d consider it an experiment in gender-fluid songwriting.</p>\n<p>But Bruce did rewrite the lyrics, and it&#8217;s instructive to take a close listen and appreciate how Bruce approaches his craft.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen Stockton Girls\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_cKBiQvTO2w?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>The exact chronology of the Stockton siblings is unclear&#8211;we don&#8217;t know whether the girls came first, last, or somewhere in between the four &#8220;Stockton Boys&#8221; demos. All five of the demos (four boys, one girl) feature partially or heavily bluffed lyrics, so there&#8217;s little we can glean by comparing the lyrical completeness.</p>\n<p>The most we can infer is that Bruce was clearly reaching for a song about working men and women looking for release on a Friday night, rather than setting up a romance. If anything, the Stockton songs feel like a precursor to &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/10/28/roll-of-the-dice-out-in-the-street/\">Out in the Street</a>&#8221; (which was also recorded around this time).</p>\n<p>The song construction of &#8220;Stockton Boys&#8221; and &#8220;Stockton Girls&#8221; is similar: it&#8217;s Friday night (5:30 for the boys, 8pm for the girls), it&#8217;s payday, and the boys and girls are ready to let off some steam.</p>\n<p>But while the boys aren&#8217;t particularly interested in romance (they&#8217;re too busy acting tough, making noise), the girls are looking for some dance partners:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Soon as Friday night comes around, 8 o&#8217;clock they roll into town</em><br />\n<em>Looking for a few good thrills with a paycheck to kill</em><br />\n<em>Her hands hurt ???</em><br />\n<em>Baby wants to go out, baby wants to dance</em><br />\n<em>Baby wants to find a little romance</em><br />\n<em>To take her away</em><br />\n<em>Oh Stockton girls, they got no diamonds or pearls</em><br />\n<em>Running down from the factories</em><br />\n<em>Oh Stockton girls, diamonds and pearls</em><br />\n<em>I love those Stockton girls</em></p>\n<p>Stockton is clearly a blue-collar town. The girls work in the factories, the boys in the mills. Neither have anything to show for it besides the paychecks burning a hole in their pockets.</p>\n<p>Even the second verses are parallel, with the Stockton Boys leaving their wives and kids at home while the Girls ditch their kids and fathers for the night:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Susie worked down at the ???</em><br />\n<em>She got a kid and an old man</em><br />\n<em>That she takes care of ???</em><br />\n<em>They come down when the day is done</em><br />\n<em>And baby wants to rock, baby wants to roll</em><br />\n<em>Baby wants to find, but it&#8217;s too cold</em><br />\n<em>Stockton girls, ain&#8217;t got no diamonds or pearls</em><br />\n<em>They come running down from the mill</em><br />\n<em>Oh Stockton girls</em><br />\n<em>Stockton girls, they got no diamonds or pearls</em><br />\n<em>They come running down from the factory</em><br />\n<em>I love those Stockton girls</em></p>\n<p>Bruce never finished either song (that we know of), although he would develop a similar theme in &#8220;Out on the Street&#8221; and repurpose a couple of &#8220;Stockton Boys&#8221; lyrics for &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/01/11/roll-of-the-dice-working-on-the-highway/\">Working on the Highway</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In the end, both &#8220;Stockton Boys&#8221; and &#8220;Stockton Girls&#8221; are curiosities, signposts on the road to <em>The River</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Stockton Girls<br />\nRecorded:</strong> Autumn 1979 (home demo only)<br />\n<strong>Never released</strong><br />\n<strong>Never performed</strong></p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
