Starting off defiantly with the anthemic &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/12/25/roll-of-the-dice-we-take-care-of-our-own/\">We Take Care of Our Own</a>,&#8221; Bruce descends from anger to surrender, bottoming out with &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/02/21/roll-of-the-dice-this-depression/\">This Depression</a>&#8221; before climbing out towards &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/01/05/roll-of-the-dice-land-of-hope-and-dreams/\">Land of Hope and Dreams</a>&#8221; and closing with the eternal &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/09/15/roll-of-the-dice-we-are-alive/\">We Are Alive</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>And then, almost as an afterthought, comes two bonus tracks: &#8220;Swallowed Up (In the Belly of the Whale)&#8221; and &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/01/10/roll-of-the-dice-american-land/\">American Land</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The latter makes sense as a bonus track&#8211;although it&#8217;s not a completely square peg in the album&#8217;s roundly economic theme, Bruce had already given it an official release as a live performance back in 2006.</p>\n<p>But as for the former&#8230; I try not to second-guess Bruce&#8217;s album inclusion and sequence choices (or at least I <em>try</em> to try not to), I can&#8217;t help but feel like Bruce made the wrong call: the album would have been better served with &#8220;Swallowed Up&#8221; as its nadir and &#8220;This Depression&#8221; in the bonus track slot. (Or better yet, keep them both and kick &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/07/29/roll-of-the-dice-youve-got-it/\">You&#8217;ve Got It</a>&#8221; to the back of the disc.)</p>\n<p>&#8220;This Depression&#8221; is a great song, but it breaks the album&#8217;s theme. It shifts the focus from the societal wreckage wreaked by economic inequity to a more universal and personal depression.</p>\n<p>By contrast, &#8220;Swallowed Up&#8221; packs just as much emotional wallop without ever straying thematically, and it&#8217;s much more artistically daring&#8211;breathtakingly so. It deserves to have been the album&#8217;s centerpiece rather than an afterthought.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s take a listen. But first&#8211;and I know I say this often, but this time it&#8217;s\u00a0<em>really</em> necessary&#8211;put on your headphones. and turn up the volume. And if you can, turn out the lights.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Swallowed Up (In The Belly Of The Whale)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LboAVgvL_jc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;Swallowed Up&#8221; is so intimate that we can actually hear the ambiance of the room Bruce recorded it in. If you listen clearly, even in the song&#8217;s opening measures, you can hear every movement Bruce makes, every tap of a fingertip against his guitar.</p>\n<p>The effect is one of unsettling intimacy, as if we&#8217;re in such close proximity to Bruce that he&#8217;s literally singing in our ear.</p>\n<p>Musically, there&#8217;s a lot going on: the simulated ocean waves, the somber bass drum, and the out-of-tune guitar lead a procession of low-register instruments (including the bassoon and contrabassoon, in their first appearances in a Bruce Springsteen song) that drag us to murky depths.</p>\n<p>The lyrics pave more familiar ground, employing biblical metaphor (in this case, the story of Jonah and the whale) for secular purpose.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I fell asleep on a dark and starless sea</em><br />\n<em>With nothing but the cloak of God&#8217;s mercy over me</em><br />\n<em>I come upon strange earth and a great black cave</em><br />\n<em>I dreamt I awoke as if buried in my grave</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>We&#8217;ve been swallowed up</em><br />\n<em>We&#8217;ve been swallowed up</em><br />\n<em>Disappeared from this world</em><br />\n<em>We&#8217;ve been swallowed up</em></p>\n<p>Now, it certainly possible to interpret &#8220;Swallowed Up&#8221; in a broader context than purely economic, especially with only the first verse and chorus to reflect on. The notion of a great black cave that swallows one whole is a pretty apt way to describe depression.</p>\n<p>But there&#8217;s something about that third line in the chorus&#8211;&#8220;Disappeared from this world&#8221;&#8211;that suggests something more. The second verse suggests as much, too:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>The bones of sailors from the north and sailors from the east</em><br />\n<em>Lay high in a pyre in the belly of a beast</em><br />\n<em>A beast should you wander in its path upon your ship and your flesh he&#8217;ll sup</em><br />\n<em>You&#8217;ll disappear from this world &#8217;til you&#8217;ve been swallowed up</em></p>\n<p>Besides what must be Bruce&#8217;s most awkward syntactical construction, that verse implies that this isn&#8217;t an inner demon, and it isn&#8217;t a personal one: it&#8217;s claimed the lives of the narrator&#8217;s countrymen, and it claims as its prize not just your soul but your home.</p>\n<p>But as is often the case with Bruce, it comes down to a single couplet to drive the message home:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>We trusted our skills and our good sails</em><br />\n<em>Put our faith that with God the righteous in this world prevail</em></p>\n<p>And that&#8217;s the song&#8217;s heart and torment in a nutshell: we&#8217;re raised to believe that with strong skill, persistence, values, and faith, we&#8217;ll find a path in this world&#8211;if not to riches, then at least to security.</p>\n<p>But that&#8217;s no longer the case, if it ever was:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>But we&#8217;ve been swallowed up</em><br />\n<em>We&#8217;ve been swallowed up</em><br />\n<em>Disappeared from this world</em><br />\n<em>We&#8217;ve been swallowed up</em></p>\n<p>There may be opportunity out there. But there&#8217;s also a beast, a whale that feeds on smaller creatures to survive. And each time the whale feeds, it grows bigger, stronger, more dangerous.</p>\n<p>Unfortunate enough to lie in its path, Bruce&#8217;s narrator finds himself unable to resist its appetite.\u00a0Swallowed up, disappeared from this world, as if he was never there.</p>\n<p>If the narrator&#8217;s spectral cries of anguish&#8211;jolting in their suddenly high register&#8211;don&#8217;t raise the hair on your arms, then you haven&#8217;t surrendered yourself to the song.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Swallowed Up&#8221; stopped me in my tracks the very first time I heard it. Years later, I still consider it one of Bruce&#8217;s most powerful and artistic compositions. It&#8217;s a song that could never fully translate to a live setting, and therefore not one we&#8217;re ever likely to hear live.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s so potent that I almost postponed writing this article when the dice turned up its number in the midst of a pandemic, and when I followed my own listening advice above, I could feel the song sitting on my chest.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s some pretty great art.</p>\n<p><strong>Swallowed Up (In the Belly of the Whale)<br />\nRecorded:</strong> 2011<br />\n<strong>Released:</strong>\u00a0<em>Wrecking Ball</em> (2012)<br />\n<strong>Never performed</strong></p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
