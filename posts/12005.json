But today&#8217;s pairing goes way, way, waaaaay back&#8230; all the way to 1971, when a 22-year-old Bruce Springsteen was fronting a band named after himself.</p>\n<p>Although you&#8217;d be hard pressed to tell the difference between The Bruce Springsteen Band and the E Street Band by its personnel (especially toward the end of its run, when it consisted only of Bruce, Steve Van Zandt, Garry Tallent, David Sancious, and Vini Lopez), you wouldn&#8217;t have any trouble figuring out which band you were listening to by their sound.</p>\n<p>The Bruce Springsteen Band was a jam band to its core, and their sets featured a mix of brassy Springsteen originals and bluesy arrangements of popular rock and R&amp;B covers. On the night of November 13, 1971, they gave the Bruce Springsteen Band treatment to Marvin Gaye&#8217;s 1965 Top Ten hit, &#8220;Ain&#8217;t That Peculiar,&#8221; opening the show with it at The Student Prince in Asbury Park.</p>\n<p>The band had a guest-star that night as well: Southside Johnny joined the band on harmonica throughout most of the set. And for that one-off &#8220;Ain&#8217;t That Peculiar&#8221; opener, Southside took lead vocals as well&#8211;although it&#8217;s David Sancious on keyboards who steals the show on this number.</p>\n<p>Take a listen to this amazing recording (just in its mere existence all these years later) from that once-only performance of Southside Johnny fronting The Bruce Springsteen Band on Marvin Gaye&#8217;s &#8220;Ain&#8217;t That Peculiar.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Ain&#039;t that peculiar  ( Marvin Gaye cover )\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WlNyiUnYHQg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Gaye&#8217;s original recording is one of his best-known and -loved Motown classics, but obviously that didn&#8217;t stop Bruce from dramatically re-interpreting it.
