So take the dates at the bottom of the article with a grain of salt.</p>\n<p>We\u00a0<em>think</em> Bruce played his original song &#8220;Magic Kind of Loving&#8221; at least three times that month, but only one of those performances circulates widely&#8211;and it&#8217;s a somewhat muddy audience recording, which makes it difficult to understand Bruce&#8217;s lyrics at times.</p>\n<p>But that&#8217;s okay, because Bruce is focusing more on the music here&#8211;&#8220;Magic Kind of Loving&#8221; is a fierce, guitar-driven rocker designed to get and keep the audience on their feet&#8211;it&#8217;s more typical of Bruce&#8217;s Steel Mill songwriting than his BSB-era output.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Magic Kind Of Lovin&#039; - Bruce Springsteen Band\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ukHSDaYB-f0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>As for the lyrics, there are several lines almost impossible to decipher, but the rest are clear enough for us to grok the song without the mystery lines.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well I might not be no natural-born lover</em><br />\n<em>Or a brown eyed handsome man</em><br />\n<em>Well ???</em><br />\n<em>and she said that I want you</em><br />\n<em>???</em><br />\n<em>She got a magic kind of loving</em><br />\n<em>It sure don&#8217;t matter for me</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well I might not be no king bee</em><br />\n<em>And my baby might not be no queen</em><br />\n<em>Well when she comes to the door</em><br />\n<em>She says &#8220;Daddy I&#8217;m yours&#8221;</em><br />\n<em>???\u00a0</em><br />\n<em>She got that magic kind of loving</em><br />\n<em>It sure don&#8217;t matter for me</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well I might not be no natural born lover</em><br />\n<em>???</em><br />\n<em>But whenever she&#8217;s blue</em><br />\n<em>She said Daddy, I want you</em><br />\n<em>???</em><br />\n<em>She got that magic kind of loving</em><br />\n<em>And it sure does matter for me</em></p>\n<p>In other words, the lovers in &#8220;Magic Kind of Loving&#8221; may not be beauties, but they&#8217;re all right&#8211;and that&#8217;s alright with them.</p>\n<p><strong>Magic Kind of Loving<br />\nFirst performed:</strong> February 4, 1972 (Richmond, VA)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> February 25, 1972 (Richmond, VA)</p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
