After repeated cajoling from Fonda, Dylan scratched out a few lines on a napkin:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>The river flows, it flows to the sea</em><br />\n<em>Wherever that river goes, that\u2019s where I want to be</em><br />\n<em><span id=\"IL_AD1\" class=\"IL_AD\">Flow</span>, river,\u00a0flow</em></p>\n<p>Dylan gave the napkin to Fonda along with his blessing for another songwriter to take it from there.</p>\n<p>Fonda turned to Roger McGuinn of The Byrds, who completed the song and credited Dylan as co-writer&#8211;much to Dylan&#8217;s annoyance. Dylan insisted his credit be removed, and today Dylan is cited simply as having provided &#8220;input.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Roger McGuinn - &quot;Ballad of Easy Rider&quot;\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BWoMz6C7INQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Meanwhile, although McGuinn recorded a lovely solo version of &#8220;Ballad of Easy Rider&#8221; for the film, for some reason he immediately re-recorded it with The Byrds for release as a single. As a result, in short order there were two different versions available, both featuring McGuinn: his solo recording (released in August 1969) and a band version (released in October).</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"The Byrds - Ballad of Easy Rider (1969)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/r8jC1lRZGTU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Both versions are great, and when Bruce Springsteen covered &#8220;Ballad of Easy Rider&#8221; for the first and only time (at his 1981 benefit concert for the Vietnam Veterans of America), his arrangement seemed to draw from both of them.
