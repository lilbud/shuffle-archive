But it&#8217;s also one of Bruce&#8217;s most misunderstood songs&#8211;or perhaps more accurately, one of his most malleable songs.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Born in the U.S.A.&#8221; is a song that seems to adapt to the arrangement, the context, and the moment in which it is sung, and if it seems in turns angry, celebratory, proud, ashamed, defiant and resigned&#8230; well, perhaps that&#8217;s by design. After all, it took Bruce himself a long time to figure out what he was trying to say&#8211;and there&#8217;s no better way to illustrate that than by tracing the evolution of the song.</p>\n<p>So let&#8217;s pick our story up where we left off, with the melody of &#8220;Vietnam&#8221; paired with prequel lyrics to &#8220;Born in the U.S.A.&#8221;&#8211;and the first appearance of what would eventually become an iconic chorus.</p>\n<div id=\"v-ZZMFFtgu-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='426' src='https://videopress.com/embed/ZZMFFtgu?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>Bruce continued working on the song throughout the remainder of 1981, and the three takes in the combined clip below show his remarkable craft at work. Let&#8217;s eavesdrop as Bruce inches his way toward his vision. In this next version, we have a new but familiar melody. For the first time, we can hear the final song taking shape:</p>\n<div id=\"v-ypaZ9d3b-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='426' src='https://videopress.com/embed/ypaZ9d3b?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>Bruce&#8217;s lyrics have progressed significantly, although the chorus sounds just a bit too jingoistic for the tone Bruce is trying to strike.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Got in a little hometown jam</em><br />\n<em>So the law put a rifle in my hand</em><br />\n<em>Sent me off to kill the yellow man</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Born baby in the U.S.A.<br />\nI believe in the American Way</em></p>\n<p>The second take features a slower tempo, expanded lyrics, and the first appearance of the &#8220;long gone daddy&#8221; refrain:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Got in a little hometown jam</em><br />\n<em>so the law put a rifle in my hand</em><br />\n<em>sent me off to kill the yellow man</em><br />\n<em>??? rock and roll band</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Born in the U.SA., Born in the U.S.A.</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;m a long gone daddy in the U.S.A.</em></p>\n<p>(&#8220;I&#8217;m a long gone daddy&#8221; is a reference to the Hank Williams song by the same name, in which the singer leaves home and a dysfunctional relationship. With a famous chorus of &#8220;I&#8217;m leaving now, I&#8217;m leaving now, I&#8217;m a long gone daddy, I don&#8217;t need you anyhow,&#8221; Bruce uses the reference here as shorthand for his character&#8217;s determination to escape his lot in life. And of course, it works out about as well as we suspect it did for Hank Williams&#8217; character.)</p>\n<p>The song continues with a fascinating verse that gives the singer&#8217;s returning friend a voice&#8211;albeit a bitter one.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>My buddy, he come back from Vietnam</em><br />\n<em>He said nobody remembers who i am</em><br />\n<em>People sure forget real fast man</em><br />\n<em>I don&#8217;t give a damn</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Assembly line to the front lines</em><br />\n<em>Take you directly toward Saigon</em><br />\n<em>Born in the U.S.A.</em><br />\n<em>You better know what&#8217;s going on</em></p>\n<p>The song returns to familiar territory now, with almost-final lyrics&#8211;except for a heart-breaking final line.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Had a buddy over in Khe Sahn</em><br />\n<em>Fighting off them Viet Cong</em><br />\n<em>They&#8217;re still there but he&#8217;s all gone</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>He had a little girl in Saigon</em><br />\n<em>Sent me a picture of him in her arms</em><br />\n<em>Said he&#8217;d bring her back</em><br />\n<em>But I don&#8217;t know where she&#8217;s gone.</em></p>\n<p>The last take in the clip above is fascinating. Bruce switches the perspective and writes from the first person now. This time it&#8217;s\u00a0<em>him</em> who was in Khe Sahn and who had the girl in Saigon. It&#8217;s a subtle change that shows how Bruce was still experimenting to find the right nuance for the song.</p>\n<p>Bruce continues, bringing back the pivotal scene and wrenching chorus from &#8220;Vietnam&#8221; and turning it into a pair of verses that starkly illustrate the young man&#8217;s plight.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I was digging dirt and I was eating the sand</em><br />\n<em>Came back to see the VA man</em><br />\n<em>He had some papers there in his hands</em><br />\n<em>That said I died there in Vietnam</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Assembly line to the front lines</em><br />\n<em>Back home to the unemployment row</em><br />\n<em>Detroit straight to Saigon</em><br />\n<em>Man this whole world sure is cold</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 13pt;\"><span style=\"caret-color: #3d3d3d; color: #3d3d3d; font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.3); text-size-adjust: 100%; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; text-decoration: none; float: none; display: inline !important;\">That &#8220;I </span>died<span style=\"caret-color: #3d3d3d; color: #3d3d3d; font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.3); text-size-adjust: 100%; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; text-decoration: none; float: none; display: inline !important;\"> there in </span>Vietnam<span style=\"caret-color: #3d3d3d; color: #3d3d3d; font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.3); text-size-adjust: 100%; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; text-decoration: none; float: none; display: inline !important;\">&#8221; line works just as well here as in &#8220;Vietnam&#8221; &#8212; on two levels at once: irony (\u201cwe heard you died over there\u201d) and metaphor (\u201cthe person we knew died in the war; the person who came back is a stranger\u201d).</span></span></p>\n<p>There&#8217;s one final verse here, and it almost sounds like an afterthought. It&#8217;s powerful, but it&#8217;s a step too far from the personal toward the political:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I wonder where them Cambodians gone</em><br />\n<em>When them bombs started falling like rain</em><br />\n<em>I don&#8217;t care what they say</em><br />\n<em>They wasn&#8217;t bombing the white man that way</em></p>\n<p>You&#8217;d think that Bruce would instinctively realize he was venturing from the narrative. Instead, in the next take, he doubles down:</p>\n<div id=\"v-tFEoOcRo-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='426' src='https://videopress.com/embed/tFEoOcRo?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>Yes, you heard those lyrics right:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Richard Nixon&#8217;s on the lam</em><br />\n<em>After dropping bombs on the yellow man</em><br />\n<em>I don&#8217;t care what shit they say</em><br />\n<em>They wouldn&#8217;t bomb a white man that way</em><br />\n<em>Not a day in prison did he spend</em><br />\n<em>They should have cut off his balls and let them twist in the wind</em></p>\n<p>Thankfully, those lyrics soon vanish. But the verse that follows is instantly recognizable&#8211;it&#8217;s very close to what will eventually become the song&#8217;s opening verse:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Born down in a dead man&#8217;s town</em><br />\n<em>Where they kick you when you hit the ground</em><br />\n<em>What you got ain&#8217;t enough</em><br />\n<em>You spend half your time just coverin&#8217; up</em></p>\n<p>There&#8217;s also a final verse that&#8217;s hard to make out, and that&#8217;s too bad&#8211;because the opening couplet is terrific and would have served the song well:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>They planted an American flag</em><br />\n<em>on a cake that said &#8220;welcome home&#8221;</em><br />\n<em>??? in a different house</em><br />\n<em>but it&#8217;s forever gone.</em></p>\n<p>In Bruce&#8217;s next take, the classic introduction is now completely in place. In fact, the entire song is now <em>very</em> close to final&#8211;other than the masterful yet economical verse with the VA man (which Bruce is still struggling to find the right place for) and the still-missing &#8220;ten years burning down the road&#8221; closing, the song is essentially complete.</p>\n<div id=\"v-xqUD3rof-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='426' src='https://videopress.com/embed/xqUD3rof?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>Finally, in this last version, we hear a much more comfortable and confident Bruce. He clearly feels that he&#8217;s close to completion, and indeed the final lyrics are all present.</p>\n<div id=\"v-c1iuoKno-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='426' src='https://videopress.com/embed/c1iuoKno?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>But we also have the return of the backstory verses from &#8220;Vietnam&#8221; along with some harrowing, you-are-there imagery that&#8217;s powerful enough to overpower the pain and neglect that await him upon his return home:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Son, behind that line of trees, something&#8217;s waiting in the jungle rain</em><br />\n<em>there deep in the dark forest, there&#8217;s a river without a name</em><br />\n<em>Go crawl up there on your knees, go crawlin&#8217; quiet, boy, as you can</em><br />\n<em>Lieutenant sir, if you please, I wanna see my baby again</em></p>\n<p>Bruce would shortly and wisely drop those lyrics.</p>\n<p>The next version of &#8220;Born in the U.S.A.&#8221; is the one Bruce eventually released on\u00a0<em>Tracks</em>. It&#8217;s tighter now, with an eerie echo and anguished howls that makes the singer seem even more isolated and alone than on the rock version&#8211;enough to raise goosebumps if you listen to it in a dark room.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Born In The USA (acoustic from Tracks)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3UBei3n4FOY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>There&#8217;s also the first hint of an electrified &#8220;Born in the U.S.A.&#8221; near the end of the clip above. Indeed, Bruce seems to have intended &#8220;Born in the U.S.A.&#8221; to be a rocker from the beginning (although Max Weinberg recalls recording a country version somewhere along the way). Bruce sent the above version of the song to his manager, dismissing it as &#8220;a little ditty&#8221; that should be done &#8220;very hard rockin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As powerful as the acoustic version is, it&#8217;s hard to argue with Bruce. In late April 1982, Bruce assembled the E Street Band to take a crack at the song, and their eight-minute(!) unreleased take (only their second, and the one that would form the basis for the final version) immediately proves Bruce&#8217;s point. Roy&#8217;s synthesizer riff is a clarion call for the veteran&#8217;s countrymen to wake up and <em>see</em> him, and Bruce&#8217;s rock vocals convey the perfect mix of anger, anguish, loss, and betrayal.</p>\n<div id=\"v-KAVddP0t-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='426' src='https://videopress.com/embed/KAVddP0t?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>Bruce and the boys would finally nail the song just a few days later, on May 3, 1982, with a much shorter jam but with Max&#8217;s famous-ever-after lightning-in-a-bottle drum solo that just barely holds the band together until Bruce counts them back in.</p>\n<p>The finished track was magic, and the band knew it. Released more than two years later as the title track of Bruce&#8217;s 1984 album&#8211;and as a single on Halloween eve, backed by its litter-mate &#8220;Shut Out the Light&#8221;&#8211;&#8220;Born in the U.S.A.&#8221; was an immediate hit, peaking at #9 in the U.S. and #5 in the U.K. (1984 was a great year for music).</p>\n<p>On Thanksgiving eve, Bruce released his video for the song, strangely pairing the recording with out-of-sync concert footage and a dubbed audience. &#8220;Born in the U.S.A,&#8221; may be one of Bruce&#8217;s better songs, but it&#8217;s not one of his better videos. Even the cutaways to a small child followed by a vast cemetery were too subtle to register with most viewers.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Born in the U.S.A.

Although technically and ironically his words were not inaccurate, it&#8217;s highly likely that &#8220;Born in the U.S.A.&#8221; was the song Reagan had in mind when he said this at a campaign stop:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Ronald Reagan - Bruce Springsteen (19.09.1984)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/z8BRWNaOdlc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>In fairness, though, at times it seemed like Bruce was determined to feed the controversy. In January 1985, producer Arthur Baker (who had previously tried his hand at &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/12/25/roll-of-the-dice-dancing-in-the-dark/\">Dancing in the Dark</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/01/13/roll-of-the-dice-cover-me/\">Cover Me</a>&#8220;) produced a trio of remixes of Bruce&#8217;s anthem.</p>\n<p>These remixes draw a lot of scorn, but if you listen carefully, they&#8217;re actually pretty good&#8211;especially the &#8220;Freedom Mix&#8221; below. Yes, it&#8217;s mostly a curiosity today, but had the final minute of Bruce&#8217;s studio version sounded as harrowing and haunted as the final minutes of Baker&#8217;s remix, a lot fewer people would have misunderstood the song.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Born In The U.S.A.
