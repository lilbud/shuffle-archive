As far back as 1965 The Castiles performed &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/03/17/matr-bruce-springsteen-and-eric-burdon-we-gotta-get-out-of-this-place/\">We Gotta Get Out of This Place</a>&#8221; at a local psychiatric hospital only four months after The Animals originally released the song.\u00a0In 1967 The Castiles covered &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/05/22/cover-me-san-franciscan-nights/\">San Franciscan Nights</a>&#8221; in concert before it was even a month old.</p>\n<p>Despite Bruce&#8217;s obvious fondness for The Animals, though, he&#8217;s never covered one of their greatest hits at one of his own shows.\u00a0&#8220;I&#8217;m Crying&#8221; was one of The Animals&#8217; first singles, peaking at #19 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #8 on the U.K. Singles charts when it was released in September 1964.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"The Animals

aligned: On March 1, 1990, Tom Petty &amp; The Heartbreakers played The Forum in Los Angeles, and both Bruce Springsteen and Bob Dylan were on-hand for the occasion.</p>\n<p>Tom brought Bruce and Bob on stage during the encores for two songs, the latter of which was &#8220;I&#8217;m Crying.&#8221; Judging from the clip below, Bruce was more than happy to oblige.</p>\n<div id=\"v-4Sw2cr76-1\"
