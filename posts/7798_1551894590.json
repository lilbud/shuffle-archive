And every once in a while, one of those one-off covers conjured true magic.</p>\n<p>Case in point: &#8220;Little Bit O&#8217; Soul,&#8221; originally released in 1965 by a British band called The Little Darlings.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"&quot;Little Bit O&#039; Soul&quot; - The Little Darlings (ORIGINAL  VERSION 1965)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QcJmAKpMdQE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>The Little Darlings&#8217; version didn&#8217;t make any noise on the charts, but The Music Explosion sure did when they covered it two years later&#8211;it made it all the way to Number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 and became a garage rock classic.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Little Bit O&#039; Soul (Remastered Stereo Version)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4fyn-cFgjSk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Both versions are instantly recognizable thanks to the infectious riff that serves as the song&#8217;s signature, but it&#8217;s the latter one that clearly captured Bruce&#8217;s attention.</p>\n<p>When a fan with great musical taste brought a sign for &#8220;Little Bit O&#8217; Soul&#8221; to the opening show of Bruce&#8217;s final stand at the Philadelphia Spectrum, it proved too much for Bruce to resist.</p>\n<p>After a minute of consultation to work it out, the E Street Band nailed the song&#8211;and we&#8217;re fortunate that the moment was captured on video. Bruce&#8217;s smile while performing says it all.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the one and only time Bruce has covered &#8220;Little Bit O&#8217; Soul,&#8221; from that epic stand at the Spectrum in October
