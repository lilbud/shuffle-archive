Fortunately, the performance was captured for posterity and issued on the CD single for Joe&#8217;s &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/05/08/matr-joe-grushecky-and-bruce-springsteen-labor-of-love/\">Labor of Love</a>.&#8221; While you can clearly here Bruce on backing vocals and guitar throughout, it&#8217;s a performance worth listening to even if Bruce hadn&#8217;t been there.
