had more of an &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/01/29/meeting-across-the-river-bruce-springsteen-and-levon-helms-all-stars-up-on-cripple-creek/\">Up on Cripple Creek</a>&#8221; vibe to it until Max infused it with the Bo Diddley beat, and in so doing Max transformed &#8220;She&#8217;s the One&#8221; into one of the most electrifying songs in Bruce&#8217;s catalog.</p>\n<p>But that&#8217;s only part of the story.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>It began with the Big Man.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I wrote &#8216;She&#8217;s the One&#8217; because I wanted to hear Clarence play the sax in that solo,&#8221; Bruce admitted to author Bill Flanagan in 1987. &#8220;I sort of went back and wrote the words to it just &#8217;cause I wanted to hear that beat and hear Clarence play that&#8230; I wanted that sax solo and I wanted the guys to play the beat and I had a production idea.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Bruce debuted &#8220;She&#8217;s the One&#8221; in concert on October 4, 1974 (more than ten months before it would be released on album), and in those early performances, Clarence did indeed get a workout&#8211;like in this recording from Boston&#8217;s Music Hall on October 29th.</p>\n<!--[if lt IE 9]><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\">document.createElement('audio');</script><![endif]-->\n<audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-25005-1\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/108-Shes-The-One-1974-10-29.mp3?_=1\" /><a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/108-Shes-The-One-1974-10-29.mp3\">https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/108-Shes-The-One-1974-10-29.mp3</a></audio>\n<p>Clinton Heylin&#8217;s excellent documentation of Bruce&#8217;s recording sessions in\u00a0<em>E Street Shuffle</em> pins Bruce&#8217;s first studio cut at &#8220;She&#8217;s the One&#8221; on October 16th, and I&#8217;m inclined to believe it based on the recording.</p>\n<p>The lyrics are the same as in the Boston performance on the 29th, but Clarence&#8217;s solo is more restrained, lending credence to placing it in mid-October.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - She&#039;s The One (alternate Version with different Lyrics)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Wh9jdatP70?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer;

the lyrics were an afterthought.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I sort of went back and wrote the words to it just &#8217;cause I wanted to hear that beat and hear Clarence play that&#8230; Things can be compelling just musically. I think that later on I tended to get a little more\u00a0lyric-oriented <em>first</em>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But about those lyrics&#8230;</p>\n<hr />\n<p>It began on the backstreets.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Sometimes I&#8217;ll have a couple of lines that can sit around for four or five years. I knew they were good lines but they never found exactly the right setting. In those days, I used to switch and trade all the time. You could do it with a lot of that stuff. I do it a little bit now, but not as much as I used to. It still happens on occasion.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Bruce&#8217;s admission was in answer to Flanagan&#8217;s observation that &#8220;She&#8217;s the One&#8221; (even in its final version) included a French cream/French kisses couplet lifted straight from Bruce&#8217;s 1973 outtake, &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/03/06/roll-of-the-dice-santa-ana/\">Santa Ana</a>&#8221; (which at the time of Flanagan&#8217;s interview was still more than a decade away from an official release on\u00a0<em>Tracks</em>.)</p>\n<p>But if you listened carefully to the outtake and early live performance above, you probably had a strong sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\u00a0from a completely different song.</p>\n<p>That original version of &#8220;She&#8217;s the One&#8221; (which Bruce performed regularly in concert right up until the spring of 1975) wasn&#8217;t the romantic meditation we know and love today. Bruce&#8217;s original lyrics were spiteful and vituperative. This was clearly a post-breakup song.</p>\n<p>It was also clearly a work in progress. It isn&#8217;t just that we&#8217;re used to hearing the final lyrics&#8211;these early lyrics are clunky and awkward, especially the second verse:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well it was not distance, and it was not length</em><br />\n<em>That brought down that wonder girl</em><br />\n<em>It was a date last night and a lover\u2019s fight</em><br />\n<em>In a mixed-up baby\u2019s world</em><br />\n<em>And you were with me in New York</em><br />\n<em>That time we pushed real hard and baby I got beat</em><br />\n<em>You ran and left me wasted</em><br />\n<em>Wasted, burning right there in the street</em><br />\n<em>A ghost like dust, oh baby with that smile</em><br />\n<em>Oh you were born to run</em><br />\n<em>Oh, oh she\u2019s the one</em></p>\n<p>That may be a contender for the worst verse Bruce has ever written.</p>\n<p>If we can get past its awkwardness, though, there are a couple of interesting things to note: first, the obvious reference to another destined-for-legend Springsteen song; second, a whiff of &#8220;Backstreets&#8221; in the wasted/street line.</p>\n<p>That scent is about to get a lot stronger:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>We hated your ma, we hated your pa</em><br />\n<em>We hated the kids, we hated the cops</em><br />\n<em>I hated the lies and I hated the truth that ran us down</em><br />\n<em>Most of all I hated the town for what they did</em><br />\n<em>I hated the way they made us live</em><br />\n<em>I hated him for his fancy ways</em><br />\n<em>And I hated you when you went away</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Now you\u2019re back and you\u2019re huddled in the corner</em><br />\n<em>Where you hated me baby, just like a child</em><br />\n<em>Get back on your feet, come out into the street</em><br />\n<em>Where love was dangerous and wild</em><br />\n<em>Remember all the movies, all them movies, baby</em><br />\n<em>That we\u2019d go see, tryin\u2019 to learn how to walk</em><br />\n<em>Talk, talk rough, just like all the heroes</em><br />\n<em>We thought we had to be</em><br />\n<em>A smile that shines upon me</em><br />\n<em>One that burns just like the sun</em><br />\n<em>Oh, she\u2019s the one</em></p>\n<p>Now, we&#8217;ve heard Bruce borrow his own lyrics when working on new music before. But all evidence suggests that this is different&#8211;although Bruce is known to have been working on &#8220;Backstreets&#8221; as early as October 1974 (the same time he was road-testing &#8220;She&#8217;s the One&#8221; in concert), it&#8217;s likely that &#8220;Backstreets&#8221; had different lyrics at that time, and that the lyrics we know and love from that epic were originally created for its poppier album-mate.</p>\n<p>Bruce&#8217;s last known performance of the early version of &#8220;She&#8217;s the One&#8221; was in March 1975; one month later, he recorded both the earliest circulating studio take of &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/05/14/roll-of-the-dice-backstreets/\">Backstreets</a>&#8221; (which we&#8217;ll listen to in a future <em>Roll of the Dice</em> entry) and this next studio outtake of &#8220;She&#8217;s the One.&#8221; As we can hear, the transplant is complete&#8211;the &#8220;Backstreets&#8221; lyrics have been completely excised. We have no replacements, though; &#8220;She&#8217;s the One&#8221; is now shorter and tighter but still angry and harsh.</p>\n<audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-25005-2\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/313-Shes-The-One-v2a-May-5-1975.mp3?_=2\" /><a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/313-Shes-The-One-v2a-May-5-1975.mp3\">https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/313-Shes-The-One-v2a-May-5-1975.mp3</a></audio>\n<p>This second outtake is also notable for Bruce&#8217;s scat-ified sax solo&#8211;Clarence must not have been at the studio that day.</p>\n<p>Now, if you&#8217;re familiar with Bruce&#8217;s record release dates, you might already be wondering: if &#8220;She&#8217;s the One&#8221; is in such a disjointed state in April 1975&#8211;only four months before\u00a0<em>Born to Run</em> was on record store shelves&#8211;when exactly did Bruce get it together?</p>\n<p>The answer is: late. Very, very late.</p>\n<p>How late? So late that the album was already finished.</p>\n<p>So late that the <em>Born to Run</em> Tour had already begun.</p>\n<p>Bruce didn&#8217;t play &#8220;She&#8217;s the One&#8221; on the tour&#8217;s opening night, but on Night Two (July 22), he played it with its final lyrics for the first time. We don&#8217;t know exactly when he came up with them, but I suspect it was probably shortly before he debuted them. Because two nights later, Bruce was back in the studio recording those lyrics for the first time. He finished &#8220;She&#8217;s the One&#8221; the following night, July 25th.</p>\n<p>The album was on sale a month to the day later, featuring a dramatically transformed &#8220;She&#8217;s the One.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"She&#039;s the One\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/blbFaatKszE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>The differences in the first verse are subtle but significant: whoever <em>She</em> is, the girls no longer want to rip her apart. The emphasis is on the narrator&#8217;s inner turmoil now&#8211;he&#8217;s no longer angry, he&#8217;s just in over his head.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>With her killer graces and her secret places</em><br />\n<em>That no boy can fill with her hands on her hips</em><br />\n<em>Oh and that smile on her lips</em><br />\n<em>Because she knows that it kills me</em><br />\n<em>With her soft French cream</em><br />\n<em>Standing in that doorway like a dream</em><br />\n<em>I wish she&#8217;d just leave me alone</em><br />\n<em>Because French cream won&#8217;t soften them boots</em><br />\n<em>And French kisses will not break that heart of stone</em><br />\n<em>With her long hair falling</em><br />\n<em>And her eyes that shine like a midnight sun</em><br />\n<em>She&#8217;s the one</em></p>\n<p>From the second verse forward, however, this new version is a completely different song. No longer a post-breakup song, &#8220;She&#8217;s the One&#8221; is now the story of two fierce spirits, both of whom refuse to be tamed, one of whom may secretly want to be.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>That thunder in your heart</em><br />\n<em>At night when you&#8217;re kneeling in the dark</em><br />\n<em>It says you&#8217;re never gonna leave her</em><br />\n<em>But there&#8217;s this angel in her eyes</em><br />\n<em>That tells such desperate lies</em><br />\n<em>And all you want to do is believe her</em><br />\n<em>And tonight you&#8217;ll try just one more time</em><br />\n<em>To leave it all behind and to break on through</em><br />\n<em>Oh she can take you, but if she wanna break you</em><br />\n<em>She gonna find out that ain&#8217;t so easy to do</em><br />\n<em>And no matter where you sleep tonight or how far you run</em><br />\n<em>She&#8217;s the one</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>And just one kiss</em><br />\n<em>She&#8217;d fill them long summer nights</em><br />\n<em>With her tenderness that secret pact you made</em><br />\n<em>Back when her love could save you from the bitterness</em></p>\n<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s the One&#8221; is ultimately still a break-up song, but Bruce has shifted his characters earlier in their story. Now the focus is on the inevitability of the split, rather than the fallout.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s only when we go back and read the final lyrics that we realize that even in its final state, &#8220;She&#8217;s the One&#8221; seems unfinished, as if it was meant to have a final verse to either provide resolution or make it clear that none is in the offing.</p>\n<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s the One&#8221; <em>reads</em> lyrically rushed and incomplete, but it doesn&#8217;t <em>sound</em> that way. Once again: the lyrics are almost beside the point.</p>\n<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s the One&#8221; is an alchemical fusion that has no business working as well as it does.</p>\n<p>But it does.</p>\n<p>When Bruce shortened the song, he tautened it. When he jettisoned his spiteful lyrics, he infused all of their anger and frustration into the E Street Band&#8217;s performance. (Roy Bittan in particular is practically a dervish in early performances.)</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"She&#039;s the One (Live at the Hammersmith Odeon, London &#039;75)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cx_K0tFXr8k?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s the One&#8221; crackles and sizzles, and its appearance in the set list guarantees an adrenaline rush rivaled only by &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/10/31/roll-of-the-dice-night/\">Night</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/01/24/roll-of-the-dice-my-love-will-not-let-you-down/\">My Love Will Not Let You Down</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It quickly became a set list mainstay, and as Bruce realized how many rock and roll songs were built on that unforgettable beat, &#8220;She&#8217;s the One&#8221; would often feature several minutes of build-up, usually in the form of rock classics like &#8220;Not Fade Away&#8221; and &#8220;Mona,&#8221; sometimes drawn from Bruce&#8217;s own catalog like &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/07/01/roll-of-the-dice-preachers-daughter/\">Preacher&#8217;s Daughter</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/08/30/roll-of-the-dice-aint-got-you/\">Ain&#8217;t Got You</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - She&#039;s The One (Includes Gloria &amp; Not Fade Away) / Landover 1978\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Koogv4fLLnM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen &amp; The E Street Band - She&#039;s The One (Live in Houston, 1978)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LicjPZ3GSLs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen Live 1988 - Ain&#039;t Got You &amp; Shes The One\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PQOaUQTM55E?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>But even (and perhaps especially) without any build-up or introduction), &#8220;She&#8217;s the One&#8221; turbocharges the set.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen &amp; The E Street Band - She&#039;s the One (Live In Barcelona)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0KfvXjbBFaU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen &amp; The E Street Band - She&#039;s the One (London Calling: Live In Hyde Park, 2009)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xg7tlh-H6_Y?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>There&#8217;s a reason why &#8220;She&#8217;s the One&#8221; is one of Bruce&#8217;s most performed songs, even if its lyrics don&#8217;t rank in the top half of his catalog.
