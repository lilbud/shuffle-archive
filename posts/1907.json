Listening to it years later, I love how fresh the <em>Devils &amp; Dust</em> material sounds so early in the tour. And since we&#8217;d managed to avoid all spoilers (it was much easier in those days), there were some genuinely breathtaking surprises, starting with the pump organ opener of &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2023/02/19/roll-of-the-dice-my-beautiful-reward/\">My Beautiful Reward</a>&#8221; and the bullet mic version of &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/02/27/roll-of-the-dice-reason-to-believe/\">Reason to Believe</a>.&#8221; We hadn&#8217;t even hit the new material yet, and I&#8217;d already heard two personal premieres.</p>\n<p>&#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/05/26/roll-of-the-dice-two-faces/\">Two Faces</a>&#8221; was a stunner&#8211;it was only the second time the song had been performed since 1988, and it was the early highlight of the show for me:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Two Faces - Oakland, May 5 2005\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XNDtMzKT7Qw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>In all, I heard fifteen(!) songs I&#8217;d never heard before that night, including the tour premiere of &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/04/16/roll-of-the-dice-nebraska/\">Nebraska.</a>&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Nebraska - Oakland, May 5 2005\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/k3CJROja3Tc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>We even lucked out with the tour premiere of &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/01/05/roll-of-the-dice-land-of-hope-and-dreams/\">Land of Hope and Dreams</a>,&#8221; my personal favorite Bruce song and only the second time it had ever been performed acoustically.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Land of Hope and Dreams - Oakland, May 5 2005\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/psFjDUQuviY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8230;but even though I was there, I have to rely on the bootleg for to remind me of most of the detail and nuance of Bruce&#8217;s performance that night.</p>\n<p>Why? Because sitting directly in front of me and one seat to the right was the late, great Robin Williams, and I was fascinated watching his reactions to the songs&#8211;so much so that I forgot to notice my own. Robin was clearly a fan, and he was rapt for the entire show, with the same joy and wonder playing across his face as the rest of us. (In my imagination, I pictured him joining Bruce on stage for an encore of &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/08/05/roll-of-the-dice-fire/\">Fire</a>&#8221; in full Elmer Fudd mode, but alas, it was not to be.)</p>\n<p>So of all the shows I&#8217;ve attended, this is the one I remember least vividly&#8211;the downside of proximity to your heroes.</p>\n<p>Luckily, I was able to attend three more shows that tour, and those shows I remember perfectly&#8211;they were full of riches.
