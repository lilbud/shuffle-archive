He can get his ideas across with humility and an ability to do what he wants to do. He\u2019s run his own band longer than I have, so I don\u2019t have to say, &#8216;Hey Bruce, how about&#8230;?&#8217; He says, &#8216;How about if I try this?&#8217; and &#8216;How about if I try that?&#8217; and, he\u2019s Bruce Springsteen &#8212; sure, try it.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">&#8212; John Mellencamp, <em>Cleveland.com</em>, February 7, 2022</span></p></blockquote>\n<p>Word got out quickly.</p>\n<p>First, the two were spotted at a local diner in Mellencamp&#8217;s Bloomington, Indiana stomping grounds in April 2021.</p>\n<p>A month later, Mellencamp revealed Springsteen&#8217;s involvement during a pre-Grammy gala and an interview with <em>Billboard</em>.</p>\n<p>In June, Bruce confirmed their collaboration during his <em>From My Home to Yours\u00a0</em>radio show and a call-in to E Street Radio the next day. He told host Jim Rotolo, &#8220;I worked on three songs on John&#8217;s album, and I spent some time in Indiana with him. I love John a lot and he&#8217;s a great songwriter, and we&#8217;ve actually become very close. And I&#8217;ve had a lot of fun with him. So I sang a little bit on his music&#8230; he&#8217;s got a terrific record that I think is coming out in the fall, I think&#8230; you know, I&#8217;m not exactly sure.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It took a little longer than that, but Mellencamp finally released <em>Strictly a One-Eyed Jack</em> in January 2022, and as promised it featured three Springsteen appearances. As the first single and video (and featuring duet vocals from Bruce), &#8220;Wasted Days&#8221; got all the buzz. &#8220;Did You Say Such a Thing&#8221; featured Bruce on backing vocals; it received considerably less notice.</p>\n<p>Bruce&#8217;s third album appearance went almost completely under the radar.</p>\n<audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-36658-10\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://audio.pulsewebcontent.com/MP3/2022/01_jan/John_Mellencamp_On_Sessions_With_Bruce_Springsteen.mp3?_=10\" /><a href=\"https://audio.pulsewebcontent.com/MP3/2022/01_jan/John_Mellencamp_On_Sessions_With_Bruce_Springsteen.mp3\">https://audio.pulsewebcontent.com/MP3/2022/01_jan/John_Mellencamp_On_Sessions_With_Bruce_Springsteen.mp3</a></audio>\n<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s playing guitar on &#8216;(A) Life Full of Rain,&#8217; Mellencamp told MyRadioLink.com, &#8220;He&#8217;s playin&#8217; the lead. &#8216;Cause Bruce started out as a lead guitar player \u2014 he wasn&#8217;t so much the singer of the band as he was the guitar player. So he had that ability to play that type of guitar.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t the first time Mellencamp praised Bruce&#8217;s melodic talents. While most fans and critics focus on his lyrics, Mellencamp had this to say to Howard Stern in 2018:</p>\n<audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-36658-11\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width:

Life Full of Rain&#8221; is a moody and contemplative closing track, featuring gruff solo vocals from Mellencamp and an emotive Springsteen guitar solo unlike anything we&#8217;ve heard from him on his own albums.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"John Mellencamp, Bruce Springsteen - A Life Full Of Rain (Visualizer)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\"
