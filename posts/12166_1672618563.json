How could I pass that up?</p>\n<p>Well, I couldn&#8217;t, of course. My conversation with Efraim is only one segment of wide-ranging episode, but I had a blast getting introduced to Tori Amos super-fandom!</p>\n<p>So instead of my usual commentary here, If you&#8217;ve got 110 minutes or so, take a\u00a0 listen to Efrain and David discovering and analyzing both Bruce&#8217;s and Tori&#8217;s versions of &#8220;I&#8217;m on Fire,&#8221; along with my comparative thoughts, and let me know what you think.</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"0335 BFP Era Tracks - I&#039;m On Fire by Drive All Night: The Songs of Tori Amos\" width=\"758\" height=\"400\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&#038;url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F664413398&#038;show_artwork=true&#038;maxheight=1000&#038;maxwidth=758\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Efrain and David feel like kindred spirits to me: they&#8217;re deep into their mission to profile every song that Tori Amos has ever recorded, including the covers, and boy are they\u00a0<em>thorough</em>. Each episode features a line-by-line analysis, notable covers, great live performances, and more. When they tackle Tori covering another artist, they invite a &#8220;superfan&#8221; (their word, not mine) of the original artist to provide comparative context and commentary.</p>\n<p>Efrain and I had a great conversation; it was fascinating to talk to someone so interested to learn all about Bruce but who was a relatively blank Springsteen slate. For my part, I learned a lot about what Bruce and Tori fans have in common, discovered some great covers of &#8220;I&#8217;m on Fire&#8221; that I hadn&#8217;t known about, and heard some outstanding Tori Amos live performances of Bruce&#8217;s music that flat-out floored me (including a cover of &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/09/29/roll-of-the-dice-growin-up/\">Growin&#8217; Up</a>&#8221; that&#8217;s never been released but which you can hear during the show).</p>\n<p>So thanks again, Efrain and David, for a great conversation, for an introduction to the Toriverse, and for adding a handful of great covers to my &#8220;to-blog&#8221; list!</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>It\u2019s a crossover!
