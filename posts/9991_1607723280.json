Why did Bruce drop it? As far as I know, no one&#8217;s ever asked him, and he&#8217;s never commented.</p>\n<p>But when fans who ordered the deluxe edition of the album played the bonus DVD that came with it, they quickly discovered that the Thom Zimny-directed video for &#8220;A Night with the Jersey Devil&#8221; was included.</p>\n<p>Bruce apparently wasn&#8217;t satisfied with that limited exposure, though: in April 2009, he released the song as the B-side to the single for &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/11/25/roll-of-the-dice-what-love-can-do/\">What Love Can Do</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>So let&#8217;s stop and tally: this song that Bruce couldn&#8217;t commit to releasing on an album nevertheless received an official release on Bruce&#8217;s web site, his Youtube channel, a DVD, and a single. That&#8217;s a lot of weight to put behind an outtake&#8211;which might make sense if it was a great song. But &#8220;A Night with the Jersey Devil&#8221; is a bit&#8230; odd.</p>\n<p>It starts out as a creepy retelling of a local myth, almost a Halloween version of &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/04/16/roll-of-the-dice-nebraska/\">Nebraska.</a>&#8221; Midway through, we suspect something else is at play, and by the end, we realize that Bruce has pulled a fast one on us. &#8220;A Night with the Jersey Devil&#8221; is ultimately a good-natured prank&#8211;one stop short of a novelty song, and that&#8217;s probably what prompted its album revocation at the last minute.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s take a listen and go inside the song, but let&#8217;s start with a quick history lesson. When I was a kid, I used to go canoeing with my friends in the New Jersey Pine Barrens. We all knew the story of the Jersey Devil, and the two-minute History Channel clip below sums it up pretty well.\u00a0 Give it a watch, and then we&#8217;ll move on.</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.history.com/embed/21150900\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Now that we&#8217;re versed in the history of the Jersey Devil, we can see that the first half of the song is a colorful but essentially traditional first-person retelling of the myth surrounding the thirteenth child of Mother Leeds. In fact, the video even starts with a brief textual recap, before a coyote&#8217;s howl heralds the emergence of an oddly dispassionate (for now) Bruce Springsteen from the murky depths.</p>\n<p>Bruce seems lost in thought (and a really poor lip-syncher) as he tells his tale:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Hear me now!</em><br />\n<em>I was born 13th child, &#8216;neath the 13th moon</em><br />\n<em>Spit out hungry and born anew</em><br />\n<em>Daddy drag me to the river, tie me in rocks</em><br />\n<em>Throw me in where it&#8217;s deep and wide</em><br />\n<em>I go down, I don&#8217;t die</em><br />\n<em>Hole in the river bottom, I crawl through</em><br />\n<em>Come back kill six brothers and sisters, kill Papa too</em><br />\n<em>Sway down Mama, sway down low</em><br />\n<em>They gonna know me wherever I go</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Into my bed with her kerosene my mama creep</em><br />\n<em>Set my flesh to burning, whilst I sleep</em><br />\n<em>I burn, burn, burn, till my soul burn black</em><br />\n<em>Black rains fall, I come back, I come back</em></p>\n<p>Creepy, yes. But basically a first-person Jersey Devil origin story with a Muddy Waters blues riff and the bullet microphone that Bruce grew so fond of during the Devils &amp; Dust Tour (almost certainly a coincidence, but who knows).</p>\n<p>But then the song takes a sudden turn: Bruce&#8217;s voice is sinister now (and his lip-synching much better); his eyes lock onto ours as if he&#8217;s finally registered our presence. He&#8217;s done retelling history&#8211;now he&#8217;s making a promise directly to us:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Get down Mama, get down low</em><br />\n<em>They gonna know me wherever I go<br />\n16 witches cast 16 spells</em><br />\n<em>Make me guitar outta skin and human skull</em><br />\n<em>Sing you a song like the wind in the sandy loam</em><br />\n<em>Bring you baby out your happy home</em></p>\n<p>And this is where we realize that something strange has happened, because the myth of the Jersey Devil has just merged with the legend of Bruce Springsteen. They&#8217;re now one and the same. Fiendish demon or rock star&#8211;is there a difference? Perhaps not in the mind of the singer, he seems to be saying. At least not tonight.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Ram&#8217;s head, forked tail, clove hoof, love&#8217;s my trail</em><br />\n<em>I sup on your body, sip on your blood like wine</em><br />\n<em>Out world theirs, this world mine</em><br />\n<em>So kiss me baby till it hurts</em><br />\n<em>God lost in heaven, we lost on earth</em><br />\n<em>Sway down Mama, sway down low</em><br />\n<em>They gonna know me wherever I go\u00a0</em><br />\n<em>Wherever I go, wherever I go</em></p>\n<p>And now comes the punchline: Bruce seamlessly segues into the first verse and chorus from Gene Vincent&#8217;s 1958 single, &#8220;Baby Blue,&#8221; a song with basically the same riff but lyrically the polar opposite of &#8220;A Night With the Jersey Devil.&#8221; (So much of the song is used, in fact, that Bruce credits Gene Vincent and Robert Jones as his co-songwriters.)</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Gene Vincent ~ Baby Blue [HQ]\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/d7bb2Fcq5hk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>This is where we realize that everything that came before is a would be Romeo&#8217;s inner monologue. &#8220;Baby Blue&#8221; reveals to us that the singer is a lovestruck musician who sees himself as a much more sinister ladies&#8217; man than anyone else does. Perhaps the title of the song should have given it away from the beginning&#8211;it&#8217;s just a typical night with a would-be Jersey Devil.</p>\n<p>And just in case we don&#8217;t get the joke, Bruce windmills on air guitar while his stick figure drawing of a devilish guitar player closes out the song.</p>\n<p>Pretty clever, all in all, but it&#8217;s hard to imagine an album that it would fit on&#8211;or a setlist, for that matter. On Halloween night 2012, Bruce opened his show in Rochester with his one and only performance to date of &#8220;A Night with the Jersey Devil.&#8221; Maybe it played better to those who were there, but watching it from a distance, it seems more a curiosity than anything else. (It would have been cool if he had played a full &#8220;Baby Blue,&#8221; though.)</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Night with the Jersey Devil - Rochester, NY 10-31-12\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/I-cRhE4diyk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><strong>A Night With the Jersey Devil</strong><strong><br />\nRecorded:</strong> 2007-2008<br />\n<strong>Released: </strong>Digital Download (2008), <em>What Love Can Do\u00a0</em> (b-side, 2009)<br />\n<strong>First performed:\u00a0</strong>October 31, 2012 (Rochester, NY)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> October 31, 2012 (Rochester, NY)</p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
