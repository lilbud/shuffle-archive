Of course, it&#8217;s fleeting. Or at least it will be, and the narrator probably knows it. But that&#8217;s not the point. The point is that in life, we have moments where everything else&#8211;our jobs, our fears, our sources of stress and strife&#8211;all fade into the background, and we are gifted with calm, peace, joy, and contentment.</p>\n<p>The groom in &#8220;The Honeymooners&#8221; is wise enough to recognize the moment, to live in it and preserve it. May we all have that same gift.</p>\n<p>The Honeymooners shares one other trait with &#8220;County Fair:&#8221; the crickets in &#8220;County Fair&#8221; draw us into the magic of a summer night in a way that the music itself couldn&#8217;t. In &#8220;The Honeymooners,&#8221; listen just past the 1:50 mark, as a barking dog and passing car take us on that front porch as the music trails off. Is it intentional, or is it background noise? (Bruce recorded &#8220;The Honeymooners&#8221; at home, after all, so either is possible.) I don&#8217;t know, but it&#8217;s accidental it&#8217;s also serendipitous, and it&#8217;s a perfect way to end a perfect song about a day of perfect moments.</p>\n<p><strong>The Honeymooners<br />\nRecorded: </strong>February 22, 1987<strong><br />\nReleased: </strong><em>Tracks</em> (1998)<br />\n<strong>Never performed</strong></p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
