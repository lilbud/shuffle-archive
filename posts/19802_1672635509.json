Part public art and part roadside attraction, the Cadillac Ranch is a string of ten old Cadillacs buried nose down in the ground.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Cadillac Ranch History - Amarillo Texas\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NqtTz-Uw2kU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>The cars themselves represent the golden age of the American automobile; buried and arranged as if in a graveyard, the installation serves as a metaphor for our fleeting youth and inevitable death.</p>\n<p>In &#8220;Cadillac Ranch&#8221; the song, Bruce leaps behind the wheel of that metaphor and takes it on a manic, gleeful joyride before eventually driving it even deeper into the ground than the actual Cadillacs themselves.</p>\n<p>Whenever Bruce refers to a Cadillac, he speaks of Death. (In this song, at least. In his other Caddy song, &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/08/21/roll-of-the-dice-pink-cadillac/\">Pink Cadillac</a>,&#8221; it represents a vagina. Make of that what you will.)</p>\n<p>So when Bruce sings&#8230;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well there she sits, buddy, just a-gleaming in the sun</em><br />\n<em>There to greet a working man when his day is done</em></p>\n<p>&#8230;he&#8217;s saying: Death is always nearby, waiting patiently for the end of your working day (i.e. your life).</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I&#8217;m gonna pack my pa and I&#8217;m gonna pack my aunt</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;m gonna take them down to the Cadillac Ranch</em></p>\n<p>My dad&#8217;s dead. My aunt&#8217;s dead, too. I&#8217;m burying them both.</p>\n<p>(Bruce sometimes changes the line to &#8220;I\u00a0<em>wanna</em> pack my aunt&#8221; which makes the line much funnier.)</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Eldorado fins, whitewalls and skirts</em><br />\n<em>Rides just like a little bit of heaven here on earth</em><br />\n<em>Well buddy when I die throw my body in the back</em><br />\n<em>Drive me to the junkyard in my Cadillac</em></p>\n<p>Heaven on earth, get it? Clever jokes aside, what Bruce is really saying in this verse and in the chorus that follows is: Life is a road trip, and death is the destination. If you don&#8217;t make an effort to enjoy the ride, then what&#8217;s the point of driving at all?</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Cadillac, Cadillac</em><br />\n<em>Long and dark, shiny and black</em><br />\n<em>Open up your engines let &#8217;em roar</em><br />\n<em>Tearing up the highway like a big old dinosaur</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>James Dean in that Mercury &#8217;49</em><br />\n<em>Junior Johnson running through the woods of Caroline</em><br />\n<em>Even Burt Reynolds in that black Trans Am</em><br />\n<em>All gonna meet down at the Cadillac Ranch</em></p>\n<p>James Dean died young; Junior Johnson and Burt Reynolds lived well into their eighties. But they all drove fast&#8211;both literally and figuratively.</p>\n<p>Bruce couldn&#8217;t have known when he wrote the song that Johnson and Reynolds would live to such a ripe old age, but that foreknowledge would have only underscored the message of &#8220;Cadillac Ranch,&#8221; anyway. As Neil Gaiman once wrote (through his own metaphor for death), we each get the same amount of time on this earth as everyone else gets: a lifetime. Use it while you got it.</p>\n<p>All this time, by the way, the E Street Band plays with barely restrained abandon, as if in desperation to distract us from our inevitable demise&#8211;which of course is the intent. But in the song&#8217;s final verse, things take an unexpectedly tragic turn.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Hey little girlie in the blue jeans so tight</em><br />\n<em>Driving alone through the Wisconsin night</em><br />\n<em>You&#8217;re my last love, baby, you&#8217;re my last chance</em><br />\n<em>Don&#8217;t let &#8217;em take me to the Cadillac Ranch</em></p>\n<p>I love this verse, because we can read it in different ways: if we&#8217;re romantically inclined, the little girlie is a fellow life traveler&#8211;pairing up can help us both live better and maybe even longer. If we&#8217;re more self-absorbed, our little girlie represents youth, sex, a May/December mid-life crisis as we find ourselves no longer able to ignore our advancing age.</p>\n<p>Either way, it doesn&#8217;t end well. In an ironic twist, it&#8217;s not our mortality-obsessed narrator who Death claims in &#8220;Cadillac Ranch.&#8221;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Cadillac, Cadillac</em><br />\n<em>Long and dark, shiny and black</em><br />\n<em>Pulled up to my house today</em><br />\n<em>Came and took my little girl away</em></p>\n<p>Wow! We didn&#8217;t see\u00a0<em>that\u00a0</em>coming, did we? I think we can safely assume that by &#8220;little girl,&#8221; our narrator refers to the aforementioned lady love, although it&#8217;s possible that he has a daughter.</p>\n<p>Either way, what a downer of an ending! Every time I hear the song, whether on disc or on stage, I can&#8217;t help but laugh at this point of the song. Not because of the lyrics, but because of the way Bruce and the E Street Band just party as if they&#8217;re oblivious to what Bruce just sang.</p>\n<p>Like, that&#8217;s seriously the last line of the song&#8211;the unexpected death of the person who presumably matters most to him&#8211;and Bruce just keeps on driving.</p>\n<p>And there&#8217;s probably a message in that, too: time doesn&#8217;t stop for grief. Pulling off the road of life isn&#8217;t going to bring your loved one back, so you might as well keep driving.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Even by critics who do understand the song, &#8220;Cadillac Ranch&#8221; is often lumped into the same category as &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/09/21/roll-of-the-dice-born-in-the-u-s-a/\">Born in the U.S.A.</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/12/21/roll-of-the-dice-hungry-heart/\">Hungry Heart</a>&#8221; &#8212; songs where Bruce&#8217;s lyrics are belied by the backing track.</p>\n<p>But that&#8217;s an unfair classification for &#8220;Cadillac Ranch,&#8221; because it&#8217;s hard to imagine the song working in any arrangement other than the one Bruce went with for the studio track. Trust me&#8211;Bruce has on rare occasion tried a different arrangement. It usually does not go well, like in this 2005 solo acoustic arrangement inexplicably interchanged with &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/09/10/roll-of-the-dice-ramrod/\">Ramrod</a>&#8221; on the tour.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"22.
