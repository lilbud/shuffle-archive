I always have, since I first heard it.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Queen of the Supermarket&#8221;&#8211;like the album it hails from&#8211;is frequently misunderstood and definitely underappreciated. If you&#8217;re searching its lyrics for unplumbed depths, you&#8217;re missing the point: this is a song about the beauty that can be found in mundanity, set against a backdrop of wondrousness that we take for granted.</p>\n<p>Let me show you what I mean:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><em>There&#8217;s a wonderful world where all you desire</em><br />\n<em>And everything you&#8217;ve longed for is at your fingertips</em><br />\n<em>Where the bittersweet taste of life is at your lips</em><br />\n<em>Where aisles and aisles of dreams await you</em><br />\n<em>And the cool promise of ecstasy fills the air</em><br />\n<em>At the end of each working day she&#8217;s waiting there</em></p>\n<p>Scoff all you want about Bruce the millionaire writing about the common man&#8211;but if you can walk into a Whole Foods or a Wegmans and not be at least momentarily overwhelmed by the luxuries and indulgences amassed before you, you&#8217;ve lost way more perspective than Bruce has.</p>\n<p>I&nbsp;<em>still</em> love going to my local supermarket, where I can sample my way through more kinds of cheese than I ever knew existed, find fish I never thought i&#8217;d see outside of a high-end seafood restaurant or fishing charter, try fruits and vegetables I&#8217;d never heard of, and an array of spirits more impressive than any bar I&#8217;d ever frequented as a young man.</p>\n<p>My wife and I used to go to the supermarket on dates early on in our marriage, and I vividly remember the thrill of discovery and the sense of security found there. No one dies in a supermarket&#8211;everything you need, everything you want, and everything you never knew you wanted is there.</p>\n<p>For Bruce to set a love song against that backdrop? That&#8217;s inspired.</p>\n<p>For the object of the singer&#8217;s affection to be overshadowed by her surroundings? That&#8217;s brilliant.</p>\n<p>Heck, even the instrumental track is brilliant. Watch the &#8220;making of&#8221; video below and listen to that introduction again.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen Working On A Dream - Making Of Queen Of The Supermarket and VideoClip\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/p4uhxxrzoYk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Notice how Bruce has Roy syncopate mid-bar? That&#8217;s Bruce creating a background of delayed gratification to offset the foreground of instant gratification. Genius, I tell you.</p>\n<p>I won&#8217;t even bother writing about Bruce&#8217;s warm, soaring vocal. It speaks for itself.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><em>I&#8217;m in love with the queen of the supermarket</em><br />\n<em>As the evening sky turns blue</em><br />\n<em>A dream awaits in aisle number two</em></p>\n<p>With that line, Bruce starts knitting, entwining love-struck metaphor with stark, everyday reality, and we&#8217;re never quite sure whether to laugh or swoon. Which is exactly what Bruce is going for.</p>\n<p>Look how effortlessly he does it:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><em>With my shopping cart I move through the heart</em><br />\n<em>Of a sea of fools so blissfully unaware</em><br />\n<em>That they&#8217;re in the presence of something wonderful and rare</em></p>\n<p>That line&#8211;&#8220;with my shopping cart I move through the heart&#8221;&#8211;is&nbsp;<em>exactly&nbsp;</em>what I referred to above: the juxtaposition of something tangible against something figurative, the ordinary against the sublime.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><em>The way she moves behind the counter</em><br />\n<em>Beneath her white apron her secrets remain hers</em><br />\n<em>As she bags the groceries, her eyes so bored</em><br />\n<em>And sure she&#8217;s unobserved</em></p>\n<p>Oh my. Her &#8220;secrets&#8221; beneath her &#8220;white apron?&#8221; That&#8217;s one of the most artfully subtle sexual references Bruce has ever written. And the fact that this beauty is bored and detached&#8211;numbed by overexposure to the wonders that surround her&#8211;creates the central dilemma of the song that&#8217;s so powerful that we instinctively understand it without Bruce ever stating it:</p>\n<p>If this woman isn&#8217;t moved by the richness, the beauty, the diversity and divinity that surrounds her, how in the world can our hero ever hope to attract her attention, let alone hold it?</p>\n<p>The strings swell, the backing vocals soar as our hero professes his love into the ether:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><em>I&#8217;m in love with the queen of the supermarket</em><br />\n<em>There&#8217;s nothing I can say</em><br />\n<em>Each night I take my groceries and I drift away</em><br />\n<em>And I drift away</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><em>With guidance from the gods above</em><br />\n<em>At night I pray for the strength to tell the one I love</em><br />\n<em>I love I love I love her so</em><br />\n<em>I take my place in the checkout line</em><br />\n<em>For one moment her eyes meet mine</em><br />\n<em>And I&#8217;m lifted up, lifted up, lifted up, lifted up</em></p>\n<p>And there we have it: our moment of connection, and it&#8217;s so powerful that even in that sacred setting, the singer is carried away by this one-of-a-kind in an emporium of excess.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><em>I&#8217;m in love with the queen of the supermarket</em><br />\n<em>Though a company cap covers her hair</em><br />\n<em>Nothing can hide the beauty waiting there</em><br />\n<em>The beauty waiting there</em></p>\n<p>Another clever literary device, this is. Supermarkets are notorious laboratories of product placement and packaging, with every product&#8217;s exterior engineered to attract and hold attention. And here we have a checkout clerk who is attired to do anything but that&#8211;and yet.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><em>As I lift my groceries into my car</em><br />\n<em>I turn back for a moment and catch a smile</em><br />\n<em>That blows this whole fucking place apart</em></p>\n<p>Perhaps no verse that Bruce has ever written is ridiculed as much as that one. This is a writer who does not employ f-bombs indiscriminately, so why do so here?</p>\n<p>Because the intensifier is necessary!</p>\n<p>He&#8217;s singing about a woman who radiates so much beauty that she overshadows the amazing array of riches strewn about the aisles of the supermarket.</p>\n<p>So when she steps&nbsp;<em>out</em> of the supermarket&#8230; just imagine how powerful she must be set against the backdrop of a&nbsp;<em>parking lot</em>. That smile&#8211;it must have been like looking straight into the sun. No wonder it blew the whole fucking place apart.</p>\n<p>And let&#8217;s talk about that ending, because it&#8217;s one last stoke of inspired genius, an ethereal coda where the dominant instrument is the checkout scanner. Bruce turns the the monotonal scanner into a musical instrument, illustrating the transcendent beauty in the ordinary while simultaneously (and paradoxically) bringing us back to reality&#8211;and yet still managing to keep the protagonist afloat through swooning sighs.</p>\n<p>Just. Fucking. Brilliant.</p>\n<p>Bruce doesn&#8217;t attempt &#8220;Queen of the Supermarket&#8221; on stage very often. In fact, he&#8217;s only played it three times, and always by request (probably because he&#8217;s thrilled anytime he meets someone who likes the song).</p>\n<p>But it tends not to work in concert. For one thing, it&#8217;s too delicate to translate well to a large arena or stadium; for another, the song is so carefully constructed and instrumented from start to finish that it&#8217;s just plain difficult to recapture that lightning in a bottle.</p>\n<p>To the degree that it works at all, it works best as a quiet acoustic number. Here&#8217;s such a performance from the Wrecking Ball Tour in 2013:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen 2013-05-07 Turku - Queen Of The Supermarket\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IEzGTq49Gls?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>So there.
