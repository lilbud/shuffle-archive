However, enough is legible for us to get a sense of &#8220;Sun Time&#8221; as a tender bordering on sappy love song that was no doubt intended for Bruce&#8217;s acoustic performances.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Like a forest after the rain</em><br />\n<em>As teardrops of sunlight pushes the ???</em><br />\n<em>Open like the sea after the storm ???</em><br />\n<em>And tranquility once again starts to reign</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Like a story that was never told</em><br />\n<em>Like a mountain stream with waters running so cold</em><br />\n<em>Like a flower wet with the spring</em><br />\n<em>Like the silly songs that I sing</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>The earth with all its beauty came to bare</em><br />\n<em>??? ??? through the silk thin strands of your honeyed hair</em><br />\n<em>and I feel ??? ??? knowing that your ???</em><br />\n<em>The thought that you may go away</em><br />\n<em>Clouds my tender years with ???</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&#8216;Cause I can&#8217;t see without your eyes</em><br />\n<em>And I can&#8217;t touch without your hands</em><br />\n<em>And I can&#8217;t live without your life</em><br />\n<em>And I can&#8217;t love without your love</em></p>\n<p>There&#8217;s not a lot to analyze here, due both to the illegible lines and the relatively straightforward nature metaphor as stand-in for his love interest.
