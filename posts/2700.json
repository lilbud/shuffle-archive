Indefinite vs. definite.</p>\n<p>And once I realized that, the entire meaning of the song changed on me. I&#8217;ll never listen to the song the same way again&#8211;that&#8217;s how significant that word choice was.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll explain, but let&#8217;s take a listen first to get us in the mood:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"The Promised Land\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/azQY2YBUMQc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>If you really pay attention to it, &#8220;The Promised Land&#8221; is a pretty dark song, befitting its home on a dark album:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>On a rattlesnake speedway in the Utah desert</em><br />\n<em>I pick up my money and head back into town</em><br />\n<em>Driving cross the Waynesboro county line</em><br />\n<em>I got the radio on and I&#8217;m just killing time</em><br />\n<em>Working all day in my daddy&#8217;s garage</em><br />\n<em>Driving all night chasing some mirage</em><br />\n<em>Pretty soon little girl I&#8217;m gonna take charge</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>The dogs on Main Street howl\u00a0&#8217;cause they understand</em><br />\n<em>If I could take one moment into my hands</em><br />\n<em>Mister, I ain&#8217;t a boy. No, I&#8217;m a man!</em><br />\n<em>And I believe in a promised land</em></p>\n<p>This is a man who is seriously stuck. He idles his life away a day at a time, somewhere out in a remote area of a remote state. He holds no power, he exerts no control over his life.</p>\n<p>During the day, he works for his father. Is it any wonder that the most impassioned line of the chorus is a protest that he&#8217;s a man, not a boy? One gets the sense (I do, at least) that the &#8220;Mister&#8221; he&#8217;s singing to is himself.</p>\n<p>Why are the dogs howling on Main Street? They&#8217;re howling in empathetic frustration&#8211;they feel, as the narrator feels, unable to exert any influence or control over their surroundings, their lives.</p>\n<p>If only they could just have one moment&#8230; one make-or-break moment&#8230; what would they do?</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>I&#8217;ve done my best to live the right way</em><br />\n<em>I get up every morning and go to work each day</em><br />\n<em>But your eyes go blind and your blood runs cold</em><br />\n<em>Sometimes I feel so weak I just want to explode</em><br />\n<em>Explode and tear this whole town apart</em><br />\n<em>Take a knife and cut this pain from my heart</em><br />\n<em>Find somebody itching for something to start</em></p>\n<p>We live our lives. We do what we believe we&#8217;re supposed to do, act like we believe we&#8217;re supposed to act. We try our best to live the lessons we&#8217;ve been taught about what life is supposed to be.</p>\n<p>But what do you do when the person you&#8217;re <em>supposed</em> to be isn&#8217;t the person you\u00a0<em>want\u00a0</em>to be? When the urge to rebel and escape is so overpowering that it blinds you and makes you cold to those around you&#8211;when self-determination meets collides with familial obligation and comes out the other side as self-loathing&#8230; what do you do?</p>\n<p>Do you take it out on the town?</p>\n<p>Do you find a metaphorical knife and take it out on yourself?</p>\n<p>Do you walk around with a chip on your shoulder, waiting for someone &#8220;itching for something to start&#8221; to cross your path?</p>\n<p>Or do you anesthetize yourself to ease the pain that living brings? (to quote another, much later, song)</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m well aware that most fans embrace the final verse as a stance of defiance, courage, and determination:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Well there&#8217;s a dark cloud rising from the desert floor</em><br />\n<em>I packed my bags and I&#8217;m heading straight into the storm</em><br />\n<em>Gonna be a twister to blow everything down</em><br />\n<em>That ain&#8217;t got the faith to stand its ground</em><br />\n<em>Blow away the dreams that tear you apart</em><br />\n<em>Blow away the dreams that break your heart</em><br />\n<em>Blow away the lies that leave you nothing but lost and brokenhearted</em></p>\n<p>&#8230;but I don&#8217;t hear it that way. Not anymore, at least. I used to, back when I heard Bruce sing &#8220;the&#8221; and not &#8220;a.&#8221;</p>\n<p>When I thought I heard Bruce sing about &#8220;<em>the\u00a0</em>promised land,&#8221; the narrator struck me as someone with a dream, a vision that he was trying to reach, to make real. His steadfastness was heroic, and throwing himself into the storm was an act of bravery.</p>\n<p>But once I realized Bruce was singing about &#8220;<em>a</em> promised land,&#8221; I felt the ground shift beneath me.\u00a0<em>The</em> promised land is a specific goal, a place you run <em>to. A</em><em>\u00a0</em>promised land is simply an escape <em>from.</em></p>\n<p>And once the song becomes more about running from than running toward, the narrator becomes (in my mind) more trapped, more desperate, more despairing. And that storm&#8230;\u00a0I can&#8217;t help but hear that verse as a callback to &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/02/20/roll-of-the-dice-lost-in-the-flood/\">Lost in the Flood</a>:&#8221;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>That pure American brother, dull-eyed and empty-faced</em><br />\n<em>Races Sundays in Jersey in a Chevy stock super eight</em><br />\n<em>He rides her low on the hip, on the side he&#8217;s got Bound For Glory in red, white and blue flash paint</em><br />\n<em>He leans on the hood telling racin&#8217; stories, the kids call him Jimmy the Saint</em><br />\n<em>Well that blaze and noise boy, he&#8217;s gunnin&#8217; that bitch loaded to blastin&#8217; point</em><br />\n<em>He rides headfirst into a hurricane and disappears into a point</em><br />\n<em>And there&#8217;s nothin&#8217; left but some blood where the body fell</em><br />\n<em>That is, nothin&#8217; left that you could sell</em><br />\n<em>Just junk all across the horizon, a real highwayman&#8217;s farewell</em><br />\n<em>And I said, &#8220;Hey kid, you think that&#8217;s oil? Man, that ain&#8217;t oil, that&#8217;s blood&#8221;</em><br />\n<em>I wonder what he was thinking when he hit that storm</em><br />\n<em>Or was he just lost in the flood?</em></p>\n<p>If not for the setting (Jersey vs. Utah), it wouldn&#8217;t be a stretch to wonder if &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/02/20/roll-of-the-dice-lost-in-the-flood/\">Lost in the Flood</a>&#8221; and &#8220;The Promised Land&#8221; are the same song about the same character told from two different perspectives. The storm in &#8220;Lost in the Flood&#8217; is a metaphor for drugs, and that strikes me as a very plausible read of &#8220;The Promised Land&#8221; as well. Read it again, through that lens:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Well there&#8217;s a dark cloud rising from the desert floor</em><br />\n<em>I packed my bags and I&#8217;m heading straight into the storm</em><br />\n<em>Gonna be a twister to blow everything down</em><br />\n<em>That ain&#8217;t got the faith to stand its ground</em><br />\n<em>Blow away the dreams that tear you apart</em><br />\n<em>Blow away the dreams that break your heart</em><br />\n<em>Blow away the lies that leave you nothing but lost and brokenhearted</em></p>\n<p>You hear it now, don&#8217;t you?</p>\n<p>You might argue that the rousing music belies this interpretation; I&#8217;d counter by pointing out that this would hardly be the only case of Bruce pairing painful, sobering lyrics with an anthem-like melody (see &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/09/21/roll-of-the-dice-born-in-the-u-s-a/\">Born in the U.S.A.</a>&#8220;).</p>\n<p>And just like the acoustic blues version of &#8220;Born in the U.S.A.&#8221; brings out the deep meaning and inner pain of that song, so too does the acoustic version of &#8220;The Promised Land&#8221; from the 1995-1997 and 2005 tours practically beg a darker reading:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - The Promised Land - D\u00fcsseldorf 2005-06-16 CLOSEUP\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QJhsH1TlB8Y?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>That&#8217;s not a song of defiance&#8211;that&#8217;s a song of submission and surrender, that percussive heartbeat the sound of a dream dying.</p>\n<p>And the tragedy of it is that the narrator&#8211;even in that moment of despair and surrender&#8211;<em>still</em> believes that somewhere, somewhere, there&#8217;s a promised land where he can realize his potential. If only he knew where, and how to get there.</p>\n<p>To my ears, &#8220;The Promised Land&#8221; is a deeply, deeply unsettling song.</p>\n<p>Am I able to still enjoy the anthemic arrangement at an E Street Band show? Sure. I&#8217;m well aware that Bruce sees &#8220;The Promised Land&#8221; (at least in some contexts) as a lesson to the importance of community, as a metaphor for the American dream. And I can accept that&#8211;he&#8217;s the songwriter after all&#8211;in much the same way that I can accept Bruce and Patti singing &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/02/06/roll-of-the-dice-brilliant-disguise/\">Brilliant Disguise</a>&#8221; as a love song despite its origin as something else.</p>\n<p>But every time I hear it in concert&#8211;which is a\u00a0<em>lot</em> (Bruce has played it at 65% of my 65 shows)&#8211;I feel a strange mix of defiance and doubt, of ferocity and fear, of community and isolation that takes me a song or two after to fully shake off.</p>\n<p>And whether you see the song through that lens or not&#8211;whether &#8220;The Promised Land&#8221; leaves you feeling exhilarated or defeated&#8211;it&#8217;s the sign of a great work of art when you feel that much of\u00a0<em>anything</em>. &#8220;The Promised Land&#8221; ranks up there among Bruce&#8217;s greatest art. That&#8217;s probably why it hasn&#8217;t missed a tour since it debuted.</p>\n<p><strong>Bonus clips</strong>:</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s an alternate mix of &#8220;The Promised Land,&#8221; minus Bruce&#8217;s guitar solo.
