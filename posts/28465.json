Bob Dylan had the courage to stand in that fire, and he caught the sound of that explosion. This song remains a beautiful call to arms. The meaning of this song and the echo of that explosion live on in the struggle for social justice in America that continues so fiercely today.&#8221;\u00a0 <em>&#8211;Bruce Springsteen, Kennedy Center Honors, December 7, 1997</em></span></p></blockquote>\n<p>Bob Dylan recorded &#8220;The Times They Are A-Changin'&#8221; on October 24, 1963, during the one-year anniversary of the Cuban Missile Crisis and only weeks after the March on Washington and Dr. King&#8217;s &#8220;I Have a Dream&#8221; speech.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bob Dylan - The Times They Are A-Changin&#039; (Official Audio)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/90WD_ats6eE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Within a month, President Kennedy would be assassinated, auguring a tumultuous year that proved to be an inflection point for both the Civil Rights movement and America&#8217;s overseas interventions.</p>\n<p>The times, were most definitely a-changing, and Dylan&#8217;s song made sure everyone acknowledged it. He performed it live the very next day following Kennedy&#8217;s death.</p>\n<p>Amazingly, &#8220;The Times They Are A-Changin'&#8221; was never released as a single in the U.S. It almost certainly would have been a hit if it had been. (It peaked at #9 in the U.K., where it was released in 1965.)</p>\n<p>Over the years, it&#8217;s become a beloved protest song, with covers by The Byrds, Peter Paul &amp; Mary, Simon and Garfunkel, The Beach Boys, Cher, The Hollies, and Nina Simone just in the first five years following Dylan&#8217;s original version. James Taylor and Carly Simon performed at the legendary 1979 <em>No Nukes</em> concerts, and Billy Joel performed it at his famous Soviet shows.</p>\n<p>Rarely does a year go by without a notable live or studio cover. Its rank as #59 on <em>Rolling Stone&#8217;s</em> 500 Greatest Songs of All Time is well-deserved.</p>\n<p>Given Dylan&#8217;s influence on Bruce&#8217;s music and career, it seemed predestined that Bruce would eventually cover &#8220;The Times They Are A-Changin'&#8221; in concert. When he finally did, the circumstances couldn&#8217;t have been more auspicious.</p>\n<p>On December 7, 1997, Bob Dylan was one of the honorees at the annual Kennedy Center Honors ceremony, and the &#8220;New Dylan&#8221; was one of the artists selected to pay tribute to him that night.</p>\n<p>Although he&#8217;d never played it live before, Bruce&#8217;s song selection was an obvious one. Fresh off his solo acoustic Ghost of Tom Joad Tour, Dylan&#8217;s social protest song was very much in keeping with Bruce&#8217;s own recent set lists.</p>\n<p>Bruce&#8217;s arrangement was somber and sincere, and his performance was mesmerizing both live (Dylan seemed particularly moved) and on the professionally captured video.</p>\n<p>From the 1997 Kennedy Center Honors, here&#8217;s Bruce Springsteen&#8217;s only performance to date of Bob Dylan&#8217;s &#8220;The Times They Are A-Changin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"The Times They Are A-Changin&#039; (Bob Dylan Tribute) - Bruce Springsteen - 1997 Kennedy Center Honors\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wa0fOE-x84k?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><strong>The Times They Are A-Changin&#8217;<br />\nFirst performed:</strong> December 7, 1997 (Washington, DC)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> December 7, 1997 (Washington, DC)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>One time only: Bruce performs one of the most beloved protest songs of all time for its author and original artist at the 1997 Kennedy Center Honors.</p>\n", "protected": false}, "author": 1, "featured_media": 28586, "comment_status": "open", "ping_status": "open", "sticky": false, "template": "", "format": "standard", "meta": {"_monsterinsights_skip_tracking": false, "_monsterinsights_sitenote_active": false, "_monsterinsights_sitenote_note": "", "_monsterinsights_sitenote_category": 0, "jetpack_post_was_ever_published": false, "_jetpack_newsletter_access": "", "_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs": false, "_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id": 0, "_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content": false, "_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content": false, "footnotes": "", "jetpack_publicize_message": "", "jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled": true, "jetpack_social_post_already_shared": true, "jetpack_social_options": {"image_generator_settings": {"template": "highway", "default_image_id": 0, "font": "", "enabled": false}, "version": 2}}, "categories": [4], "tags": [803, 1959], "class_list": ["post-28465", "post", "type-post", "status-publish", "format-standard", "has-post-thumbnail", "hentry", "category-cover-me", "tag-bob-dylan", "tag-the-times-they-are-a-changin"], "aioseo_notices": [], "jetpack_publicize_connections": [], "jetpack_featured_media_url": "https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/timeschange.jpg?fit=1500%2C1500&ssl=1", "jetpack_sharing_enabled": true, "jetpack_shortlink": "https://wp.me/p9w3Lk-7p7", "jetpack_likes_enabled": true, "jetpack-related-posts": [{"id": 55269, "url": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2024/12/07/kingdom-of-days-december-7/", "url_meta": {"origin": 28465, "position": 0}, "title": "Kingdom of Days: December 7", "author": "Ken", "date": "December 7, 2024", "format": false, "excerpt": "It's a date for tributes, as Bruce salutes Harry Chapin, Bob Dylan, and Sting.
