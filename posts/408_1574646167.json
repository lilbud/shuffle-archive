Extra thanks if you&#8217;re a repeat visitor, and extra\u00a0<em>extra\u00a0</em>thanks if you subscribe and/or comment. It makes me happy to know you&#8217;re there!</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m still getting the hang of WordPress but starting to feel comfortable. If you&#8217;re a more experienced blogger than I am (meaning you&#8217;ve been at it for more than 20 days), tips, suggestions, critiques are all very welcome.</p>\n<p>I also thought I&#8217;d answer a few questions that I&#8217;ve received via e-mail, the feedback form, DMs, or my somewhat bemused friends:</p>\n<p><strong>Do I really roll dice to figure out what song to write about next?\u00a0</strong>No,\u00a0 I don&#8217;t think they make dice with hundreds of sides. But I do keep it random by using Google&#8217;s random number generator. I like the surprise of not knowing what song is coming next, and it forces me to re-listen and really think about each song before writing. The only &#8220;Roll of the Dice&#8221; post that I cheated on was the first one&#8211;I wanted to start with a song that was meaningful to me. From there on out, it&#8217;s random.</p>\n<p><strong>Can I keep up the steady pace of content</strong>? I think so. Getting a head start helped, and writing at least 80% of the week&#8217;s posts in the wee hours of the preceding weekend has helped me stay ahead of the calendar. As I write this, I&#8217;m still six days ahead of schedule, so fingers crossed for staying there.</p>\n<p><strong>Why so many covers</strong>? Because there\u00a0<em>are</em> so many covers. Seriously, it was an effort cataloging the hundreds of songs that Bruce has penned or performed (I still have almost 1,400 in my list, so I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll run out of material any time soon). I can&#8217;t even begin to wrap my head around how many covers of Bruce&#8217;s songs there are by other artists&#8211;the list is crazy long. It&#8217;s also a fun way to keep content coming while I&#8217;m thinking about the longer analysis pieces, and I enjoy seeing how other artists interpret Bruce&#8217;s music. I hope you&#8217;re enjoying them, too. If you have favorites or obscure ones, please send them my way.</p>\n<p><strong>What happens with the Kingdom of Days posts after a year?\u00a0</strong>I&#8217;ll revisit. Those posts started mostly as a way for me to organize all the random video and audio clips I&#8217;d collected over the years and share anything that appears not to be in layperson&#8217;s circulation (i.e. Youtube). So far, almost everything I&#8217;ve linked to was already available, which I greatly appreciate. But I&#8217;ve created a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsJqIOT5dS3zfPk31U8o8_A\">youtube channel</a> for the clips that I can&#8217;t find elsewhere&#8211;and those clips start with Saturday&#8217;s post. You can subscribe to the channel if you want to see the clips as soon as they&#8217;re posted (generally about a week before the blog posts catch up). If you&#8217;re a long time &#8220;uber&#8221; collector, I don&#8217;t <em>think</em> you&#8217;ll discover anything new. But if you&#8217;re a moderate to ardent fan, you might dig the stuff I upload. Either way, let me know. Oh yeah, and the revisit: I don&#8217;t want to overstuff these posts, so in year two my plan is to freshen them up with new media.</p>\n<p><strong>Any plans to broaden the scope?</strong> Nope. Other than launching a new series tomorrow (concert reviews of shows I attended, called &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/category/where-the-band-was/\">Where the Band Was</a>&#8220;), I&#8217;m satisfied with the focus of this blog. There are so many great Springsteen-focused blogs out there, each with their own unique lens, so I want to keep this one personal and true to its name:\u00a0 an unpredictable journey through Bruce&#8217;s catalog, cameos, and influencees, one song at a time.</p>\n<p>Thanks again for reading, and for all of the retweets, likes, and especially the comments (those are my favorite!).
