The Tony Awards are coming up next weekend, and Aaron is a sure bet to win the Best Leading Actor in a Musical award for his performance as Christian in <em>Moulin Rouge!,\u00a0</em>a role to which he returns when the show re-opens on Broadway next Friday.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t make this prediction based on inside information or any particular insight into the theater world. It&#8217;s just that Tveit is the only person nominated this year.</p>\n<p>He&#8217;s well-deserving of the honor. I was fortunate to see him star in <em>Moulin Rouge!\u00a0</em>shortly before the shutdown, and I enjoyed him in\u00a0<em>Schmigadoon!\u00a0</em>on AppleTV+ over the summer. (Apparently, Aaron now only accepts roles in shows with exclamatory titles.)</p>\n<p>But I didn&#8217;t know he was a Springsteen fan until I googled him to look up his full credits and discovered several performances of &#8220;Thunder Road&#8221; floating around the Internet.</p>\n<p>Like many of us, Aaron was moved and inspired when he saw\u00a0<em>Springsteen on Broadway</em> in its original theatrical run, and he incorporated &#8220;Thunder Road&#8221; into his concert sets shortly thereafter.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Aaron Tveit - Thunder Road (Bruce Springsteen)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/alIEkm_QbiM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;Thunder Road&#8221; is widely considered one of Bruce&#8217;s most cinematic compositions, and Tveit clearly responds to the story as much as the song.</p>\n<p>Although he claims to have been inspired by Chris Cornell&#8217;s cover arrangement, Aaron&#8217;s performance stands tall on its own. His smooth tenor, passionate delivery, and tasteful flourishes bring Bruce&#8217;s song to life as if we were watching it on the screen or stage.</p>\n<p>So here&#8217;s wishing Aaron good luck at the Tony Awards next Sunday along with a welcome return to Broadway Friday night!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>Watch Tony nominee (and soon-to-be winner) Aaron
