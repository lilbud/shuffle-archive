And although George left no shortage of songs from which to choose, there was really only one obvious choice.</p>\n<p>Harrison wrote &#8220;Something&#8221; for The Beatles&#8217;\u00a0<em>Abbey Road</em> album, and when it was issued as a single with &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/01/15/meeting-across-the-river-bruce-springsteen-and-axl-rose/\">Come Together</a>&#8221; on the flip-side, it became his first-ever A-side and not only topped the Billboard Hot 100 but also went to #1 in Canada, Australia, West Germany, and New Zealand.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"The Beatles - Something\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/UelDrZ1aFeY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;Something&#8221; quickly became The Beatles&#8217; second most-covered song (after &#8220;Yesterday&#8221;) and the 17th most-performed song of the 20th century. Bruce made sure it was carried into the 21st as well.</p>\n<p>On December 3rd 2001, Bruce took the stage with his acoustic guitar, and together with Soozie Tyrell on violin and Patti Scialfa on backing vocals, they played a sad but achingly beautiful cover of &#8220;Something.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Something - Bruce Springsteen (3-12-2001 Convention Hall, Asbury Park, NewJersey)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MXwqzJTU8fs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>It was a beautiful arrangement, one that captured the emotion of both the song and the moment.
