I&#8217;ll always remember<span class=\"text_exposed_show\">\u00a0the days before the South Africa shows as much as I do the evenings&#8211;there&#8217;s something about new places that makes everything more vivid and detailed, and that held true for the concerts as well.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"text_exposed_show\">Even the songs I&#8217;d heard dozens of times live were fresh and exciting because they were new experiences for virtually everyone around me.

It was really small (you can see that in some of the videos that follow), and Bruce compared it to Asbury Park&#8217;s Convention Hall. For the first show, I didn&#8217;t make the pit, but I was able to see directly over it with an unobstructed line of sight to the stage by standing off to the side along the edge of the &#8220;bowl.&#8221; The price I paid for standing and dancing on a steep incline all night: aching calves the next day. It was worth it.</p>\n<p><span class=\"text_exposed_show\">Check out the videos, and you&#8217;ll feel the mood that held for the whole evening&#8211;an exuberant celebration.
