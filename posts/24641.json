That changed at Bruce&#8217;s Madison Square Garden stand in May 1988, where in a bit of symmetry Bruce once again closed a pair of shows with a Jackie Wilson cover.</p>\n<p>The second of those two performances (with Jon Landau joining the band on guitar) was officially released as part of Bruce&#8217;s official archive series, with &#8220;Lonely Teardrops&#8221; released for free on YouTube.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen &quot;Lonely Teardrops&quot; Madison Square Garden, May 23 1988\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SxbVieRyZYI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Bruce took full advantage of the band&#8217;s horn section in a bright arrangement that&#8217;s perhaps just a bit too slow and at least a minute too long to rank among his best covers (they came at the end of long shows, after all). Still, it&#8217;s a faithful and respectful performance of one of rock&#8217;s more important songs, deserving of its official release.</p>\n<p><strong>Lonely Teardrops<br />\nFirst
