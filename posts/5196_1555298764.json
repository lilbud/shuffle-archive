Still, even a casual listen to songs like &#8220;Like a Stranger&#8221; reveals that Bruce was grappling with relationships through song even when he was relatively new to them.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"The Bruce Springsteen Band, &quot;Like a Stranger&quot; 1972-02-04\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZVcW1yVSrN0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>There&#8217;s not a lot known about &#8220;Like a Stranger.&#8221; Bruce never recorded it, and he hasn&#8217;t spoken about it. We haven&#8217;t seen any lyric sheets turn up, so it&#8217;s hard to even estimate when Bruce wrote it.</p>\n<p>But we know he performed it, because we have the very well preserved recording of it above, from his days fronting the Bruce Springsteen Band in 1972.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not one of his best compositions, even in comparison to his other original songs from that period. The metaphors are spare and simple, and the language is often repetitive:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>And when the children return to their mothers</em><br />\n<em>When my lover goes home to her lover</em><br />\n<em>She pulls tight around me just like my covers</em><br />\n<em>But you know loneliness is such a bad lover</em></p>\n<p>&#8230;ouch. That&#8217;s a really weak verse (although a good last line).</p>\n<p>&#8220;Like a Stranger&#8221; is more notable for its theme&#8211;a young Bruce Springsteen coming to grips with the inner workings of relationships&#8211;than its artfulness, so I&#8217;ll keep my analysis high level.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Well no matter where I run, no matter where I hide</em><br />\n<em>Like a bloodhound on the trail of a convict lost in flight</em><br />\n<em>She sees me in the daytime, mama, she kiss me every night</em><br />\n<em>She thrills me in the night-shine, mama, and chills my sheets at night</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Yes and what I wouldn&#8217;t give</em><br />\n<em>Oh darlin&#8217; what I would not give</em><br />\n<em>Baby what I wouldn&#8217;t give to be able to live</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Like a stranger, no woman, no home</em><br />\n<em>Like a stranger, no cares but my own</em><br />\n<em>Like a stranger, a different face, a different name</em><br />\n<em>Like a stranger, a different place, a different game</em><br />\n<em>Like a stranger, a different touch, a different smell</em><br />\n<em>Cause then you would not know me so well</em></p>\n<p>That last line of the chorus is the line that makes the song. Until then, &#8220;Like a Stranger&#8221; is a typical girl-as-object-of-desire-cum-enigma song, but that last line flips the song on its head: its not the girl who&#8217;s the cipher, it&#8217;s the singer. Or rather, that&#8217;s how he wants to see himself. But his girl, she knows him all too well, and that freaks him out:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Well she claims she knows everything I do</em><br />\n<em>And why I do everything</em><br />\n<em>She says she knows all the meaning to every song I sing</em><br />\n<em>She&#8217;s the wind that blows me inside out</em><br />\n<em>On the streets at 2am</em><br />\n<em>She burns me up and spits me out, and tells me who I am</em></p>\n<p>Bruce is writing about something most of us&#8211;all but the most self-aware perhaps&#8211;encounter in our early romantic relationships: that moment when you realize that your partner understands you more than you understand yourself. If knowledge is truly power, that&#8217;s a scare concept to come to grips with. it&#8217;s also a pretty great concept for a young songwriter: it&#8217;s safer to be a stranger than to be known.</p>\n<p>So we can forgive Bruce for his relative inartfulness with &#8220;Like a Stranger,&#8221; because he&#8217;d eventually get it right. In fact, not that long from here&#8211;just three years later, he&#8217;d write and release these lyrics on vinyl:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>With her killer graces and her secret places</em><br />\n<em>That no boy can fill with her hands on her hips</em><br />\n<em>Oh and that smile on her lips</em><br />\n<em>Because she knows that it kills me</em><br />\n<em>With her soft French cream</em><br />\n<em>Standing in that doorway like a dream</em><br />\n<em>I wish she&#8217;d just leave me alone</em></p>\n<p>Compare those lines to the first verse of &#8220;Like a Stranger,&#8221; (in content, they&#8217;re basically the same) and you&#8217;ll see just how much Bruce grew as a songwriter in those three years.</p>\n<p>(And yeah, we&#8217;ll just leave that last verse alone&#8230;)</p>\n<p>We shouldn&#8217;t be too harsh with &#8220;Like a Stranger.&#8221; It&#8217;s a stepping stone to later, subtler, and more incisive songs, and there are still phrases to admire and appreciate.</p>\n<p>But there&#8217;s a reason why Bruce never recorded it, and it&#8217;s probably not oversight&#8211;so this will likely remain our definitive document of the song.</p>\n<p><strong>Like a Stranger<br />\nNever Recorded</strong><br />\n<strong>First performed:</strong> February 4, 1972 (Richmond, VA)*<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> February 25, 1972 (Richmond, VA)</p>\n<p>*evidence suggests &#8220;Like a Stranger&#8221; was performed in 1971 as well, but we cannot pin to a particular date(s)</p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
