As the <a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/11/08/kingdom-of-days-november-8/\">November 8th date approached</a>, Bruce decided to do more than just play a standard tour show; he invited some special guests (Patti and Soozie) to join him on stage, and tour premiered a whopping eight songs for the hometown crowd.</p>\n<p>But he saved the biggest and best surprise for the very last encore: he&#8217;d written a brand new song for the occasion: a tender, funny, pointed, and affectionately disrespectful remembrance called, simply, &#8220;Freehold.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Listen to that performance below (including an unintentional interlude where Bruce is reminded why he uses his Telepromptr most of the time).</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"26.

It&#8217;s interesting to note just how well the lyrics match with Bruce&#8217;s eventual book and stage show&#8211;and to remember how new this information was when Bruce first debuted this song back in 1996. There are few annotations worth making, though:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>I was born right here on Randolph Street in Freehold</em><br />\n<em>Here right behind that big red maple in Freehold</em><br />\n<em>Well I went to school right here</em><br />\n<em>Got laid and had my first beer</em><br />\n<em>In Freehold</em></p>\n<p>In both his book and his Broadway show, Bruce talks about the tree that felt like a childhood friend to him, a constant reliable companion while he was growing up. These days it&#8217;s a beech tree rather than a maple, and I wonder whether Bruce simply just didn&#8217;t get around to properly identifying it until it was gone.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Well my folks all lived and worked right here in Freehold</em><br />\n<em>I remember running up the street past the convent to the church here in Freehold</em><br />\n<em>I chased my daddy down in these bars</em><br />\n<em>First fell in love with this guitar</em><br />\n<em>Here in Freehold</em></p>\n<p>That single line&#8211;&#8220;I chased my daddy down in these bars&#8221;&#8211;would become an emotional centerpiece story in\u00a0<em>Springsteen on Broadway</em> twenty years later.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Well I had my first kiss at the YMCA canteen on a Friday night</em><br />\n<em>Maria Espinosa tell me where are you tonight</em><br />\n<em>You were thirteen but way ahead of your time</em><br />\n<em>I walked home with a limp but I felt fine</em><br />\n<em>That night in Freehold</em></p>\n<p>Bruce has mentioned Maria often since that night, but at the time, fans scratched their heads and asked, &#8220;Who?&#8221;</p>\n<p>He&#8217;d never spoken of her publicly before, and as a result, neither had she. When she was a teenager and had her secret kiss with Bruce, she was afraid of getting in trouble with her parents; years later, when Bruce was famous, she assumed no one would believe her. Maria had no idea Bruce remembered her, much less written a song about her, but once she heard the song&#8217;s lyrics she confirmed the event (which apparently lasted a full minute).</p>\n<p>(She denies she sent him home with a limp, however&#8211;that may have been poetic license on Bruce&#8217;s part.)</p>\n<p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-attachment-id=\"23602\" data-permalink=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/12/03/roll-of-the-dice-freehold/maria-3/#main\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/maria-1.jpg?fit=546%2C2443&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"546,2443\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"maria\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/maria-1.jpg?fit=67%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/maria-1.jpg?fit=229%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-23602\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/maria-1.jpg?resize=446%2C1997&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"446\" height=\"1997\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/maria-1.jpg?resize=67%2C300&amp;ssl=1 67w, https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/maria-1.jpg?resize=229%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 229w, https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/maria-1.jpg?resize=343%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 343w, https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/maria-1.jpg?w=546&amp;ssl=1 546w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 446px) 100vw, 446px\" /></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Well the girls at Freehold Regional they looked pretty fine</em><br />\n<em>Had my heart broke at least half a dozen times</em><br />\n<em>I wonder if they missed me, if they still get the itch</em><br />\n<em>Would they had dumped me if they knew I&#8217;d strike it rich</em><br />\n<em>Straight out of Freehold</em></p>\n<p>Bruce rarely lets his fame go to his head in public. This was a nice reminder that he&#8217;s subject to the same types of &#8220;glory days&#8221; what-ifs as the rest of us.</p>\n<p>The remaining verses introduce us to characters and stories that we now know well from Bruce&#8217;s writing and stage performances:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Well Tex rest in peace and Marion gave us kids a hand in Freehold</em><br />\n<em>Georgie, we started up a little Rock and Roll band in Freehold</em><br />\n<em>But we learned pretty quick how to rock it</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;ll never forget the feeling of that first five bucks in my pocket</em><br />\n<em>That I earned in Freehold</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Well I got outta here really hard and fast in Freehold</em><br />\n<em>Everybody wanted to kick my ass back there in Freehold</em><br />\n<em>Well if you were different, black or brown</em><br />\n<em>It was a bit of a redneck town</em><br />\n<em>Back then in Freehold</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Well something broke my daddy&#8217;s back in Freehold</em><br />\n<em>In &#8217;69 he left and he never come back to Freehold</em><br />\n<em>Except once he drove from California 3000 miles in three days</em><br />\n<em>Called my relatives some dirty names</em><br />\n<em>And pulled straight out of Freehold</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Sister had her first little baby at seventeen in Freehold</em><br />\n<em>Well people they can be pretty mean</em><br />\n<em>Honey you had a rough road to go but you ain&#8217;t made of nothin&#8217; but soul</em><br />\n<em>I love you more than you&#8217;ll ever know</em><br />\n<em>We both survived Freehold</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Well my buddy Mike, well he&#8217;s the mayor now in Freehold</em><br />\n<em>I remember when we used to have a lot more hair in Freehold</em><br />\n<em>Well I left and swore I&#8217;d never walk these streets again Jack</em><br />\n<em>Tonight all I can say is &#8220;holy shit, I&#8217;m back&#8221;</em><br />\n<em>Back in Freehold</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Well this summer everything was green</em><br />\n<em>Rode my kids on the fire engine through the streets of Freehold</em><br />\n<em>I showed them where dad was born and raised</em><br />\n<em>And first felt the sun on his face</em><br />\n<em>There in Freehold</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Well I still got a lot of good friends right here in town</em><br />\n<em>I can usually find me a free beer somewhere</em><br />\n<em>With offers of free meals I am blessed</em><br />\n<em>Should I go crazy, blow all my money and ruin my life, well at least I&#8217;ll never go hungry I guess</em><br />\n<em>Here in Freehold</em></p>\n<p>At the time, it was a laugh line. But with time and revelation, we now know that Bruce has long struggled with mental illness. There&#8217;s a cost that comes with being famous and continuing to live in the place that you are very publicly associated with. But there&#8217;s a benefit as well, and it must be comforting to Bruce to live in a place surrounded by people who know more than just the side of himself he presents on stage, and to know that he&#8217;s loved and supported by a town grateful for his contributions without demanding them.</p>\n<p>Finally, Bruce couldn&#8217;t let the occasion end without getting in one last good-natured jab at the expense of the school&#8217;s faculty and staff. We can almost hear the collective blush:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Well I got a good Catholic education here in Freehold</em><br />\n<em>Led to an awful lot of masturbation here in Freehold</em><br />\n<em>Father it was just something I did for a smile</em><br />\n<em>Hell, I still get a good one off once in a while</em><br />\n<em>And dedicate it to Freehold</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I ain&#8217;t putting anybody down</em><br />\n<em>Hell, in the end it all just goes and comes around</em><br />\n<em>It&#8217;s one hell of a town</em><br />\n<em>Freehold</em></p>\n<p>Despite promising a one-time-only performance, Bruce played &#8220;Freehold&#8221; periodically throughout the remainder of the tour. (One has to wonder how the song played in such far-flung places as Sydney and Warsaw.)</p>\n<p>He brought it back a couple of years later during the homecoming stand on the Reunion Tour, with some added lyrics. After the verse about his father, he added:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Now he&#8217;s there by the highway buried in the dirt</em><br />\n<em>His ghost just flippin&#8217; the bird</em><br />\n<em>To everybody in Freehold</em></p>\n<p>And in response to news of his hometown&#8217;s defeated proposal to erect a ten-foot statue of himself at a considerable cost, he sang:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Well I read something in the papers a few weeks ago that was pretty funny</em><br />\n<em>Seems the town council was debating whether to up a statue of me in my hometown, but it cost too much money</em><br />\n<em>Well I&#8217;d like to thank the Town Council my friends</em><br />\n<em>For saving me from humiliation by displaying the good hard common sense</em><br />\n<em>We learned in Freehold</em></p>\n<p>Listen to that updated performance below:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - FREEHOLD\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FLlz_IihzFA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;Freehold&#8221; is a sweet song, but after Bruce&#8217;s year-plus-long residency on Broadway and his preceding autobiography tour, it&#8217;s likely that Bruce is going to give the song a rest for a good long while.</p>\n<p>As far as we know, he&#8217;s never recorded &#8220;Freehold&#8221; in the studio.
