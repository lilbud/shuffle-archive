I\u2019ll give you a quick rundown:</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">It\u2019s about a bishop and his wife and this violin player in West Virginia.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">It\u2019s about how their daughter lost her mother to mathematics while on a business trip in Detroit.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">It has a Top 40 hook part that if we knew the words, everybody could sing to it.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">It&#8217;s about pancakes and this guy named Muskrat who lives in Richmond, Virginia, who I met when I was playin\u2019 down there. (He plays saxophone.)</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">It\u2019s about James Garner, when he was very popular years ago in his Brit (Bret? Bert?) Maverick TV shows, and it was a well-known Hollywood secret that he had an affair with a mad woman with one eye.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">It\u2019s about this little boy who told his father that the Indians are still in the woods, only nobody sees \u2018em.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">And it\u2019s about sexual pathos of elderly choirboys in Butte, Montana.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">&#8212; <em>Bruce Springsteen, January 31, 1973</em></span></p></blockquote>\n<p>Yeah, I should probably leave it at that.</p>\n<p>Because if we accept Bruce&#8217;s description verbatim, we end up with an impressionistic mess that&#8217;s at least fun to sing; if we treat his plot summary as tongue-in-cheek, however, we end up with a song-length ode to self-pleasure.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bishop Danced (Live at Max&#039;s Kansas City - January 1973)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/j3k_B-pvusI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Because Bruce once remarked that if you don&#8217;t know what one of his songs is about, it&#8217;s about sex, and we should take him at his word.</p>\n<p>Because &#8220;Bishop Danced&#8221; is laden with so much phallic, masturbatory, and ejaculatory imagery that Bruce&#8217;s inner twelve-year-old must have been laughing hysterically when the band performed it on stage.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Bishop danced with a thumbscrew woman</em><br />\n<em>Did a double-quick backflip and slid across the floor</em><br />\n<em>The Catholic traffic flowed freely across the river</em><br />\n<em>And fiddlestick fiddled quick out the front door</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Oh, baby dumpling, mama&#8217;s in the back tree</em><br />\n<em>If the bow breaks, mama might fall</em><br />\n<em>Little sad and only, baby don&#8217;t be lonely</em><br />\n<em>Oh, mama knows arithmetic, knows how to take a fall</em><br />\n<em>Mama knows arithmetic, knows how to take a fall</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>And the kids are crying, &#8220;Flapjacks, make &#8217;em fat, early in the morning&#8221;</em><br />\n<em>Little Jack, grab your hat, hear the breakfast call</em><br />\n<em>Muskrat, bat a cat, kick him in the fireplace</em><br />\n<em>There&#8217;s someone in the kitchen blowing Dinah on their horn</em><br />\n<em>There&#8217;s someone in the kitchen blowing Dinah like they&#8217;re born</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well, Maverick daddy got a one-eyed bride</em><br />\n<em>She glides like a monkey-mule kicking on the back slide</em><br />\n<em>Over hill, over hill, daddy don&#8217;t you spill now</em><br />\n<em>Papa got a switch stick, he&#8217;s pumping little Bill</em><br />\n<em>Papa got a switch stick, he&#8217;s pumping little Bill</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>And Billy he&#8217;s crying, &#8220;Tomahawk, tomahawk, daddy better duck now&#8221;</em><br />\n<em>The Mohawks, the Mohawks, they&#8217;re still out there in the woods</em><br />\n<em>Monatuk, Ocanuk, running through my dreams now</em><br />\n<em>With fire on their fingertips and Injun screams</em><br />\n<em>Fire on their fingertips and feathers made of moonbeams</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well, early in the morning the cannoneer cried</em><br />\n<em>&#8220;I seen the sailor&#8217;s warning in the western sky&#8221;</em><br />\n<em>Well, mountain man, if you can, cut me down a fir tree</em><br />\n<em>Branches full of candlesticks for baby and me</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>And my darling cried, she said, &#8220;Honey, the weathervane lately it&#8217;s been pointing the way to heaven&#8221;</em><br />\n<em>Scatterbrains, scatterbrains, watch out where you fall</em><br />\n<em>Champagne, champagne, a round for all the old choir boys</em><br />\n<em>They&#8217;re busting off the altar chasing Dinah through the hall</em><br />\n<em>They&#8217;re busting off the altar chasing Dinah through the hall</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>And like kids they&#8217;re crying, &#8220;Flapjacks, make &#8217;em fat, early in the morning&#8221;</em><br />\n<em>Little Jack, grab your hat, hear the breakfast call</em><br />\n<em>Muskrat, bat a cat, kick him in the fireplace</em><br />\n<em>There&#8217;s someone in the kitchen blowing Dinah on their horn</em><br />\n<em>There&#8217;s someone in the kitchen blowing Dinah like they&#8217;re born</em></p>\n<p>Because while I&#8217;m no one&#8217;s prude, I&#8217;m not gonna go line by line on this one.
