Sometimes entire album sequences would be scrapped, sometimes album concepts would be, too.</p>\n<p>But starting in 2005, the floodgates opened. Bruce released six albums in ten years, and toured behind them for eight of those years.</p>\n<p>By 2013, he wouldn&#8217;t even wait until the post-tour downtime to get back in the studio; Bruce\u00a0 recorded <em>High Hopes</em> while still on the road touring behind <em>Wrecking Ball.</em></p>\n<p>And then while on tour for\u00a0<em>High Hopes,\u00a0</em>Bruce did something previously unimaginable: he released an EP of songs that didn&#8217;t make the album.</p>\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t the first time Bruce had released outtakes, of course. We had the 1998\u00a0<em>Tracks</em> box set and in 2011, <em>The Promise</em>. But those collections were carefully curated, sequenced, and painstakingly presented.</p>\n<p>By contrast, <em>American Beauty</em> seemed like an afterthought, a bone thrown fans&#8217; way for Record Store Day 2014 with virtually no promotion behind it. Bruce never even played any of the album&#8217;s songs in concert.</p>\n<p>As for the songs on the EP, they all had considerable merit, but they all sounded like they were originally intended for other albums pre-<em>High Hopes.\u00a0</em>They almost certainly were. (I suspect Bruce wrote and recorded his demo for &#8220;Hurry Up Sundown&#8221; during the <em>Magic/Working on a Dream\u00a0</em>sessions that yielded a similar vein of power pop melodies.)</p>\n<p>Bruce has admitted that each of the tracks on\u00a0<em>American Beauty\u00a0</em>were originally recorded as home demos before he recut them with Brendan O&#8217;Brien. I hope that someday those original demos will escape into the wild, because at least for &#8220;Hurry Up Sundown,&#8221; the song is overpowered by the production.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Hurry Up Sundown\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Qp5CPp2v6g?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;Hurry Up Sundown&#8221; is nothing more or less than a piece of power pop, and there&#8217;s certainly nothing wrong with that. The EP album cover suggests a summer day on an open road, and that&#8217;s the proper setting for this song.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, though, Bruce and Brendan leaned a bit too much into the power and away from the pop; the end result is a loud, assertive mix that almost drowns Bruce&#8217;s vocals.</p>\n<p>If we strain and listen past the production, however, we hear a beautiful west coast melody paired with effortless Springsteenian lyrics.</p>\n<p>Those lyrics are so effortless, in fact, that one suspects that Bruce tossed this one off in an afternoon, liberally lifting phrases from &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/08/28/roll-of-the-dice-wreck-on-the-highway/\">Wreck on the Highway</a>,&#8221; &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/09/27/roll-of-the-dice-waitin-on-a-sunny-day/\">Waitin&#8217; on a Sunny Day</a>,&#8221; and &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/07/24/cover-me-roll-of-the-dice-jersey-girl/\">Jersey Girl</a>&#8221; and the theme from &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/09/11/roll-of-the-dice-im-on-fire/\">Out in the Street</a>&#8221; <em>all in the first verse</em>.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>It&#8217;s the end of another working day</em><br />\n<em>Come on and pack your blues away</em><br />\n<em>Change your clothes, we&#8217;ll go for a ride</em><br />\n<em>To the other side</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Hurry up sundown, hurry up sundown</em><br />\n<em>Hurry up sundown, hurry up sundown</em></p>\n<p>Seriously, if someone wrote a random Springsteen lyrics generator, there&#8217;s a good chance it would eventually spit out that verse all on its own.</p>\n<p>The rest of the lyrics (really just a few couplets) are more original but no more substantial. (It&#8217;s fun to play &#8220;spot the Springsteen song title/theme&#8221; though. How many can you find?)</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Over here it&#8217;s easier to breathe</em><br />\n<em>There&#8217;s a place for you and me</em><br />\n<em>And there&#8217;s no devil here to pay</em><br />\n<em>And come the light of day we pray</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>And together we&#8217;ll ride to the other side</em><br />\n<em>We&#8217;ll feel so free, just you and me</em><br />\n<em>And I&#8217;ll pay what is due</em><br />\n<em>Till the night sees us through</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>And together we&#8217;ll ride to the other side</em><br />\n<em>We&#8217;ll feel so free, just you and me</em><br />\n<em>When this long day is through</em><br />\n<em>Evening dims to blue</em></p>\n<p>If it sounds like I&#8217;m hating on &#8220;Hurry Up Sundown,&#8221; I&#8217;m not.\u00a0I quite like the song and would love to hear it played live with a bit more restraint than on the album. But given that the world seems to have forgotten it exists (Bruce never talks about it, and I&#8217;ve never seen a request sign for it), that seems unlikely.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a whole sub-genre in Bruce&#8217;s catalog of fun pop trifles, and &#8220;Hurry Up Sundown&#8221; is right at home among them, just waiting for someone to notice.</p>\n<p><strong>Hurry Up Sundown<br />\nRecorded:</strong> March 2013<br />\n<strong>Released:\u00a0</strong><em>American Beauty\u00a0</em>(2014)<br />\n<strong>Never performed</strong></p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
