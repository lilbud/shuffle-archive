His record label was still an upstart at the time, and he was looking for material for the first recording artist he&#8217;d signed.</p>\n<p>Geffen phoned a friend who happened to manage a client who Geffen thought might be just the person to write a song for his artist&#8217;s new album. Geffen&#8217;s friend agreed to talk to his client about it, and his client was up for the opportunity.</p>\n<p>Geffen&#8217;s artist was reigning disco queen Donna Summer, and his friend Jon Landau&#8217;s client was Bruce Springsteen, rock&#8217;s heir to the throne in 1982. The pairing was an intriguing one, and when red-hot producer Quincy Jones was added to the mix, it was a can&#8217;t-miss combination.</p>\n<p>Bruce set about writing a song that had one foot in the disco arena and one foot in rock. It turned out great&#8211;so great, in fact, that Landau wouldn&#8217;t let his client give &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/01/13/roll-of-the-dice-cover-me/\">Cover Me</a>&#8221; away.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Cover Me\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/s3tqIk8TPWM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Landau convinced Bruce to hang on to &#8220;Cover Me&#8221; (it became the follow-up single to &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/12/25/roll-of-the-dice-dancing-in-the-dark/\">Dancing in the Dark</a>&#8221; and peaked at #7 in 1984), urging him instead to write something just like it, but different.</p>\n<p>He did exactly that. Bruce wrote &#8220;Protection,&#8221; another disco-influenced song that was the lyrical polar opposite of &#8220;Cover Me&#8221; and recorded a demo with the E Street Band.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Protection\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/UMIs8Y23mBc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Where &#8220;Cover Me&#8221; featured a narrator begging for the shelter of his partner&#8217;s love, the narrator of the anti-&#8220;Cover Me&#8221; needs protection <em>from\u00a0</em>his lover.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Night after night I keep holding on</em><br />\n<em>You say you love me, then you leave me so lonely</em><br />\n<em>I don&#8217;t believe a single thing you&#8217;re saying</em><br />\n<em>I think it&#8217;s all some evil game you&#8217;re playing</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Still all day long, all I do is think about you</em><br />\n<em>You got me believing that I can&#8217;t live without you</em><br />\n<em>Well, if you want it, well here&#8217;s my confession</em><br />\n<em>Well, I can&#8217;t help it, you&#8217;re my obsession</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Protection, that&#8217;s what I need</em><br />\n<em>I want protection, baby, from your love</em></p>\n<p>But despite its thematic inversion, &#8220;Protection&#8221; is similar to &#8220;Cover Me&#8221; in more ways than just its musical structure and blistering Boss guitar solos. They&#8217;re both lyrically slight, as pop songs often are, relying on the chorus to carry the weight rather than fleshing out the verses with detail and character development.</p>\n<p>Still, it&#8217;s effective here&#8211;considerably more so than in &#8220;Cover Me&#8221;&#8211;thanks in large part to an adrenaline-fueled backing track that captures our narrator&#8217;s paranoia. He&#8217;s fully wrapped around his lover&#8217;s finger, and they both know it&#8211;and at least through his eyes, she seems to be enjoying torturing him.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>The phone rings in the middle of the night</em><br />\n<em>And when I pick it up, you won&#8217;t answer</em><br />\n<em>A knock on the door, I rush down the stairs</em><br />\n<em>When I open up, there&#8217;s no one there</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Out in the darkness I feel your eyes on me</em><br />\n<em>I lay in bed and feel your hands upon me</em><br />\n<em>Well, is it all just my imagination</em><br />\n<em>You keep me in doubt, believing I can&#8217;t live without your</em><br />\n<em>Protection</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I stand alone at my window</em><br />\n<em>I see you waiting in the shadows down below</em><br />\n<em>I feel your fingers on my face</em><br />\n<em>I know I want to stay, but I want to run away</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Protection, that&#8217;s what I need</em><br />\n<em>I want protection, baby, from your love</em></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s never quite clear, however, whether the off-screen love interest is as manipulative as our narrator seems to believe. Those middle verses are very similar to the dream sequence in &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/01/22/roll-of-the-dice-downbound-train/\">Downbound Train</a>&#8221; (Bruce was dipping into dream imagery often during that period), and it&#8217;s easy to imagine our narrator is haunted by his imagination more than his infatuation.</p>\n<p>Still, that last verse can go either way. Is he lost in a dream, in memory? Or is this just the beginning of a new cycle of torment? We don&#8217;t know, but either way we can feel how badly Bruce&#8217;s character needs some relief. Relief that he never gets&#8211;this is isn&#8217;t that kind of song.</p>\n<p>Summer loved the demo of &#8220;Protection&#8221; so Bruce flew out to Hollywood to work on it with her. For a time there was even talk of them recording a duet together. If such duet was ever recorded, however, it remains unconfirmed to this day.</p>\n<p>Still, Bruce spent a few days with Donna working on the song, and he appears on her officially released track, playing lead guitar and contributing backing vocals on a backing track that sounds very similar to the E Street Band&#8217;s version. (Roy Bittan also performs on the track.)</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Protection Donna Summer\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hBzoIJdPiZI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Donna released &#8220;Protection&#8221; as the second single from her self-titled album in early 1983, but it didn&#8217;t chart. It did, however, earn her a Grammy nomination for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance. (She lost to Pat Benatar.) In her album liner notes, she thanked Bruce for &#8220;hangin&#8217; out and workin&#8217; out&#8221; on the song.</p>\n<p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-attachment-id=\"31948\" data-permalink=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/12/26/rotd-cover-me-donna-summer-protection/7949_03-resize/#main\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/7949_03-resize.jpg?fit=1448%2C1448&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1448,1448\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1561904727&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"7949_03 resize\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/7949_03-resize.jpg?fit=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/7949_03-resize.jpg?fit=758%2C758&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-31948\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/7949_03-resize.jpg?resize=758%2C758&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"758\" height=\"758\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/7949_03-resize.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/7949_03-resize.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/7949_03-resize.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/7949_03-resize.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/7949_03-resize.jpg?resize=550%2C550&amp;ssl=1 550w, https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/7949_03-resize.jpg?resize=1200%2C1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/7949_03-resize.jpg?resize=600%2C600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/7949_03-resize.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/7949_03-resize.jpg?w=1448&amp;ssl=1 1448w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 758px) 100vw, 758px\" /></p>\n<p>As for Bruce&#8217;s own version, it remains complete but unreleased in his vault.
