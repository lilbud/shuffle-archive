Or at least, it&#8217;s not as old as you think it is.</p>\n<p>By the time Thomas Allen wrote it in 1905, the age of motorized barge travel had already begun. Construction began that year on a new, larger Erie Canal, and Allen&#8217;s famous song (originally entitled &#8220;Low Bridge&#8221;) was nostalgia even as it was written, memorializing an age of horse- or mule-drawn travel that was already receding into the past.</p>\n<p>Still, the song captured the public&#8217;s imagination, and recordings of it began as early as Billy Murray&#8217;s 1912 version and continue to this day.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"low bridge, everybody down / billy murray / 144 rpm\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HFa2pbeNEd8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>The lyrics have changed over the years, as folks songs often do, but it&#8217;s remarkable just how much of &#8220;Low Bridge&#8221;/&#8221;Erie Canal&#8221; survived intact. &#8220;Fifteen years&#8221; changed to &#8220;fifteen miles,&#8221; and there are other small variations as well&#8211;but the song Bruce recorded is largely the same as it had been almost a century prior.</p>\n<p>But it&#8217;s Pete Seeger&#8217;s version that Bruce appears to have drawn the most inspiration from&#8211;Bruce&#8217;s lyrics and arrangement hew extraordinarily close to Seeger&#8217;s recording.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Erie Canal\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gcwHz6bCnEg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>The narrator of &#8220;Erie Canal&#8221; knows his day has passed as surely as it has for his mule; the song is (as Bruce has often comically but truthfully remarked) a love song from the narrator to the animal co-worker that made his livelihood possible.</p>\n<p>When Bruce re-assembled his Seeger Sessions musicians for a second recording session in March 2005, &#8220;Erie Canal&#8221; was one of the songs recorded that day, and Bruce&#8217;s vocal perfectly captured the wistfulness that gives way to pride and ultimately nostalgic celebration as the song progresses. As Bruce gives his all to those final &#8220;Low Bridge!&#8221; choruses, we feel as if we&#8217;re there on the top of that barge, joining our festive passengers as we duck to avoid each passing bridge.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Erie Canal (The Seeger Sessions)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SDvYBCZwMIk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>While several of the Seeger Sessions songs would enjoy occasional encores in the years following the Seeger Sessions Tour, &#8220;Erie Canal&#8221; wasn&#8217;t among them.
