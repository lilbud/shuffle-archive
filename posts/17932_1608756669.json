Let&#8217;s take a listen:</p>\n<div id=\"v-ovwt7ZtQ-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='426' src='https://videopress.com/embed/ovwt7ZtQ?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>If there&#8217;s a through line to be drawn from &#8220;Danger Zone,&#8221; it might be one that threads through &#8220;Child Bride&#8221; on the way to &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/01/11/roll-of-the-dice-working-on-the-highway/\">Working on the Highway</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Those latter two songs&#8211;one still unreleased, the other now a classic&#8211;center around a romantic relationship between their protagonist and an underage girl.</p>\n<p>While not explicitly stated such, &#8220;Danger Zone&#8221; at the very least implies some potential age-related impropriety.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Baby, you are a big girl</em><br />\n<em>Yeah there ain&#8217;t no doubt of that</em><br />\n<em>Baby you can&#8217;t even walk around here</em><br />\n<em>And I know what&#8217;s on your mind</em><br />\n<em>And even if she&#8217;s the first to turn out the lights</em><br />\n<em>Man you&#8217;re messing in a danger zone</em></p>\n<p>Perhaps if Bruce completed the song, we would have learned more about the situation, but I suspect he meant to leave room for ambiguity.\u00a0I can&#8217;t help but picture the protagonist singing about his best friend&#8217;s kid sister, someone he&#8217;s known all her life but who suddenly seems very grown up.</p>\n<p>Our hero is tempted&#8211;sorely tempted&#8211;when the girl makes her interest known, but he knows the right thing to do.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Let the girl go home, let the girl go home</em><br />\n<em>She ain&#8217;t ??? to be around here</em><br />\n<em>Let the girl go home, the girl go home</em><br />\n<em>You don&#8217;t know what you feel</em><br />\n<em>Let the girl go home, let the girl go home</em><br />\n<em>Let her go back home this time</em><br />\n<em>Let the girl go home, let the girl go home</em><br />\n<em>Let her go back home</em></p>\n<p>Bruce keeps his narrator on the path of angels, but only through the constant exhortation of his conscience. (I can&#8217;t make out that muffled section in the second line of the chorus, but I suspect it&#8217;s something along the line of &#8220;old enough&#8221; or &#8220;grown enough.&#8221;)</p>\n<p>Note: there&#8217;s another brief section after the tape stops, but although it circulates as part of &#8220;Danger Zone&#8221; to me it sounds like a completely different song, and I suspect it is. I won&#8217;t discuss it here.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s easy to see why Bruce wouldn&#8217;t have released &#8220;Danger Zone&#8221; on\u00a0<em>Nebraska</em> even if he had finished the song (and there&#8217;s no indication he ever did). &#8220;Danger Zone&#8221; is gentle, sensitive, tender, and a far cry from the dark themes that would typify his next album.</p>\n<p>But the thing I find most fascinating about &#8220;Danger Zone&#8221; is that it&#8217;s so unlike anything he&#8217;d written before or since. We could perhaps consider &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/04/06/roll-of-the-dice-janey-dont-you-lose-heart/\">Janey, Don&#8217;t You Lose Heart</a>&#8221; a distant cousin for its warm melody and like-a-big-brother narrator, but even that would be a stretch.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll very likely never know how &#8220;Danger Zone&#8221; might have turned out, and that&#8217;s too bad. I suspect it would have been a beautiful and unique addition to his catalog.</p>\n<p><strong>Danger Zone<br />\nRecorded: </strong>March-April 1981 (demo)<br />\n<strong>Never released</strong><br />\n<strong>Never performed</strong></p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
