The man desperately needed a break, and so reluctantly the first twelves shows of the European leg were rescheduled to give Bruce a solid month to rest and rejuvenate.</p>\n<p>For Bruce, though, resting up included more songwriting, and several home demos recorded during Bruce&#8217;s month-long respite escaped into the wild.</p>\n<p>Just a few months later, Bruce&#8217;s songwriting would turn dark, leading him to his next landmark album,\u00a0<em>Nebraska. </em>But in the spring of 1981, Bruce was still very much in River mode, and several of the songs he wrote are surprisingly light and poppy. \u00a0(See &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/07/12/roll-of-the-dice-riding-horse/\">Riding Horse</a>,&#8221; for example.)</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most charming song-that-never-was from this period is a confection known as &#8220;My Heart Is an Open Book.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"v-tOMgmcPc-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='426' src='https://videopress.com/embed/tOMgmcPc?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>Employing a similar conceit to Bruce&#8217;s much-much-later composition &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/06/07/roll-of-the-dice-seven-angels/\">Seven Angels,</a>&#8221; &#8220;My Heart Is an Open Book&#8221; contrasts a transparently steadfast lover with the inscrutable object of his affection.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>You won&#8217;t say what you need</em><br />\n<em>You won&#8217;t say what you want</em><br />\n<em>You just stand in the corner</em><br />\n<em>Baby so nonchalant</em><br />\n<em>When you stand around, I try to keep my cool</em><br />\n<em>But my heart&#8217;s an open book for you</em></p>\n<p>Enter the gimmick: For the rest of the song (such as it is, it doesn&#8217;t appear that Bruce ever finished developing it), Bruce employs the time-tested Book of Love metaphor to illustrate and communicate how his love has formed and deepened. Like most relationships, the first chapters are sunny and bright:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well baby, late at night you read Chapter One</em><br />\n<em>We&#8217;re going out, we&#8217;re having fun</em><br />\n<em>You read on up to Chapter Two</em><br />\n<em>There&#8217;s a story of my love for you</em></p>\n<p>But of course, over time conflict sets in&#8211;and in times of strife, Bruce encourages his love to rely on the good book:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well, I don&#8217;t care what you say and do</em><br />\n<em>You stay angry and I talk it through</em><br />\n<em>Yeah it don&#8217;t matter baby, I&#8217;m not a fool</em><br />\n<em>Cause my heart is an open book to you</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>You&#8217;re readin&#8217; up baby, to Chapter Three</em><br />\n<em>It tells you how good our love could be</em><br />\n<em>You&#8217;re readin&#8217; on up to Chapter Four</em><br />\n<em>Well I kiss you once and then I want some more</em><br />\n<em>You read on now to chapter Five</em><br />\n<em>??? all right</em></p>\n<p>Bruce&#8217;s lyrics are unclear here at times&#8211;perhaps bluffed, even&#8211;but this is a pretty good approximation. Thankfully, &#8220;My Heart Is an Open Book&#8221; is such a pure pop song that the exact lyrics almost don&#8217;t matter&#8211;this is a song that wears its heart on its sleeve. Or as Bruce sings:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Yeah it don&#8217;t matter what I do because</em><br />\n<em>My heart is an open book to you</em></p>\n<p><strong>My Heart Is an Open Book<br />\nRecorded:</strong> March-April 1981 (home demo)<br />\n<strong>Never released</strong><br />\n<strong>Never performed</strong></p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
