Maybe it&#8217;s the nine hours of craftsmanship and 24 takes that went into it; maybe it&#8217;s Dylan&#8217;s mesmerizing, surly-yet-contrite vocals; perhaps it&#8217;s the piano-and-organ-borne backing track that sounds like it was tailor-made for the E Street Band.</p>\n<p>So sooner or later (sorry), they were bound to take a crack at it. It might not fit the vibe of Bruce&#8217;s set lists, but at soundcheck anything goes.\u00a0And anything did in Atlanta on the Tunnel of Love Express Tour.</p>\n<p>The 1988 tour is famous among fans for generating some unique soundcheck covers, and the night of March 23rd was a prime example. Bruce was in a Van Morrison mood that night (covering three of his songs), and he delved into the catalogs of Sam Cooke, The Animals, and Manfred Mann as well.</p>\n<p>Toward the end of the rehearsal, Bruce turned his attention to Dylan, opening his songbook to &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/05/08/cover-me-just-like-a-woman/\">Just Like a Woman</a>&#8221; and following up with &#8220;One of Us Must Know&#8221; (a telling selection given what was going on in his personal life at the moment).</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"ONE OF US MUST KNOW SOONER OR LATER ( cover Bob Dylan )\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/z-4XXv_gTHo?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Sure enough, Roy Bittan is appropriately front and center in the too-brief two-minute clip, and while the taper was too distant to catch Bruce&#8217;s vocals clearly, we get a very good sense of how majestic an E Street Band cover might have sounded if they ever attempted it live.</p>\n<p>That 1988 soundcheck is the only known time Bruce has performed Dylan&#8217;s underperforming 1966 single, and at this point it&#8217;s likely to remain that way. Still, we never know what debuts and rare covers Bruce might whip out on any given night, so perhaps it&#8217;s just a matter of time.
