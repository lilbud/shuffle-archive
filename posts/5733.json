(Except that I&#8217;m not entirely convinced he wrote it in this century. More on that later.)</p>\n<p>Unlike the thematically similar &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/05/02/roll-of-the-dice-candys-room/\">Candy&#8217;s Room</a>,&#8221; which drips with furious self-delusion, or the self-loathing, literal aftermath of &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/05/21/roll-of-the-dice-reno/\">Reno</a>&#8221; (more on that later as well), &#8220;Maria&#8217;s Bed&#8221; jaunts along in a playful, infectious country slide and stomp. It&#8217;s Bruce at his most carefree, singing in an unusually high register.</p>\n<p>Take a listen:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Maria&#039;s Bed\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BWJvdt7jvdw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>God<em>dammit,\u00a0</em>that&#8217;s a good song.</p>\n<p>And for a refreshing change, it&#8217;s the instrumental track that gives wings to &#8220;Maria&#8217;s Bed&#8221; moreso than the lyrics. Soozie&#8217;s violin has never been showcased so splendidly, Bruce&#8217;s guitar work (interwoven with Brendan O&#8217;Brien&#8217;s hurdy gurdy (you read that right) is delicately ambling, and the keyboards (Bruce again!) sound for all the world like the whistle of a man with no cares in the world. Musically, this is a perfect track.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s no slouch lyrically either, but it&#8217;s also something of a puzzle. At times it feels masterful, full of sublime, effortless metaphor: candy stick kisses, a wolf dog moon, sifting through dust for fools good, burned by angels and sold wings of lead&#8211;those are terrific turns of phrase that roll by so smoothly that we <em>almost</em> don&#8217;t notice their brilliance.</p>\n<p>But &#8220;Maria&#8217;s Bed&#8221; is also full of callbacks to and swipes from other Springsteen songs&#8211;so much so that one can&#8217;t help but wonder if Bruce was being lazy or deliberate:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Been on a barbed wire highway 40 days and nights</em><br />\n<em>I ain&#8217;t complaining, that&#8217;s my job and it suits me right</em><br />\n<em>I got a sweet soft fever rushing around my head</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;m gonna sleep tonight in Maria&#8217;s bed</em></p>\n<p>Four lines in, and we might as well be listening to &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/01/11/roll-of-the-dice-working-on-the-highway/\">Working on the Highway</a>:&#8221;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>I work for the county out on ninety five</em><br />\n<em>All day I hold a red flag and watch the traffic pass me by</em><br />\n<em>In my head I keep a picture of a pretty little miss</em><br />\n<em>Someday, mister, I&#8217;m gonna lead a better life than this</em></p>\n<p>Pretty similar first verses, don&#8217;t you think?</p>\n<p>But the second verse of &#8220;Maria&#8217;s Bed&#8221; is a <em>verbatim</em> swipe from a different Springsteen song:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Got on a dead man&#8217;s suit and smiling skull ring</em><br />\n<em>Lucky graveyard boots and a song to sing</em><br />\n<em>I keep my heart in my work, my troubles in my head</em><br />\n<em>And I keep my soul in Maria&#8217;s bed</em></p>\n<p>Those first two lines made a previous appearance in &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/01/01/roll-of-the-dice-further-on-up-the-road/\">Further On (Up the Road)</a>&#8221; on Bruce&#8217;s previous album,\u00a0<em>The Rising&#8211;</em>and that song actually dates back to the Reunion Tour, which raises the question:</p>\n<p>Did Bruce recycle that lyric on purpose, or is this another case (of which there are many) of Bruce taking the seed of a song in two different directions at the same time?</p>\n<p>I tend to side toward the latter as the more likely explanation: we already know that\u00a0<em>Devils &amp; Dust</em> contains songs written and recorded a decade or more before the release of the album (Bruce <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/24/arts/music/bruce-almighty.html\">once disclosed</a> that most of the album was written during the Ghost of Tom Joad Tour, and &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/09/08/roll-of-the-dice-all-the-way-home/\">All the Way Home</a>&#8221; dates back even further), so it&#8217;s very possible that &#8220;Maria&#8217;s Bed&#8221; was a sibling&#8211;perhaps even an older sibling&#8211;to &#8220;Further On (Up the Road).&#8221;</p>\n<p>Either way, it&#8217;s an odd choice of phrasing for a song like &#8220;Maria&#8217;s Bed.&#8221; It works perfectly in &#8220;Further On (Up the Road)&#8221; but here it&#8217;s jarring. Perhaps that&#8217;s the point, though: Bruce devotes a few lines of grim, dark shading in order to more effectively offset the remainder of the song, which paints Maria in primary colors:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>I been up on sugar mountain, &#8216;cross the sweet blue seas</em><br />\n<em>I walked the valley of love and tears and mystery</em><br />\n<em>I got run out of luck and gave myself up for dead</em><br />\n<em>Then I drank the cool clear waters from Maria&#8217;s bed</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>She give me candy stick kisses &#8216;neath a wolf dog moon</em><br />\n<em>One sweet breath and she&#8217;ll take you, mister, to the upper room</em><br />\n<em>I was burned by the angels, sold wings of lead</em><br />\n<em>Then I fell in the roses and sweet salvation of Maria&#8217;s bed</em></p>\n<p>The final verse features some wonderfully apt metaphor:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>I been out in the desert, yeah doing my time</em><br />\n<em>Sifting through the dust for fools gold, looking for a sign</em><br />\n<em>Holy man said, &#8220;Hold on, brother, there&#8217;s a light up ahead.&#8221;</em><br />\n<em>Ain&#8217;t nothing like the light that shines on me in Maria&#8217;s bed</em></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s so good, in fact, that Bruce used it once before&#8211;a second swipe from &#8220;Further On (Up the Road):&#8221;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Now I been out in the desert just doing my time</em><br />\n<em>Searching through the dust looking for a sign</em><br />\n<em>If there&#8217;s a light up ahead, well brother I don&#8217;t know</em><br />\n<em>But I got this fever burning in my soul</em></p>\n<p>Notice the almost-verbatim recycling of the first two lines and the parallel (but more faithful in &#8220;Maria&#8217;s Bed&#8221;) third line. Even the &#8220;fever&#8221; reference in the last line of &#8220;Further&#8221; appears in similar form earlier in &#8220;Maria&#8217;s Bed,&#8221; strengthening the argument that both songs were written around the same time.</p>\n<p>But if &#8220;Maria&#8217;s Bed&#8221; has ties to both &#8220;Working on the Highway&#8221; and &#8220;Further On (Up the Road),&#8221; it&#8217;s strongest connection is the one that&#8217;s completely invisible if you listen to the song on its own&#8230; but that jumps right out and grabs your heart if you listen to the\u00a0<em>Devils &amp; Dust\u00a0</em>album in sequence.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Maria&#8217;s Bed&#8221; is the sixth song on the album; if it was a vinyl LP, it would probably be the end of Side One. A few songs earlier, we encounter the heart-wrencher that is &#8220;Reno.&#8221; And it&#8217;s impossible to do either &#8220;Maria&#8217;s Bed&#8221; or &#8220;Reno&#8221; justice without discussing their relation to each other.</p>\n<p>Both songs revolve around a woman named Maria, who remains unseen in both songs as well. Whereas &#8220;Maria&#8217;s Bed&#8221; is the excited, carefree, heel-clicking jaunt of a man anticipating a hot night ahead, &#8220;Reno&#8221; is a story of loss, a man trying and failing to reconjure his lost love (Maria) in the form of a stranger. Both protagonists are hopelessly devoted to the object of their obsession.</p>\n<p>Listening to both songs in close succession raises the fascinating questions and possibilities:</p>\n<p>Is &#8220;Reno&#8221; a tragic sequel to &#8220;Maria&#8217;s Bed,&#8221; in which our hero loses his love and is never able to move forward?</p>\n<p>Is &#8220;Maria&#8217;s Bed&#8221; the self-deluded fantasy of a haunted widower, hoping to find glimmers of his lost love in the arms of another, like sifting through dust for fool&#8217;s gold?</p>\n<p>Or is it merely coincidence that Bruce co-locates both songs on the same album?</p>\n<p>Given how deliberate Bruce is with his work, I lean toward the prequel/sequel scenario, and when viewed through that lens, both songs take on far more power than they have individually. &#8220;Maria&#8217;s Bed&#8221; in particular, is now tinged by distant shadows of poignant loss that underline the song&#8217;s bright, sunny present. It&#8217;s uplifting and heartbreaking at the same time, a brilliant disguise of a song in which both the mask and the substance are masterful.</p>\n<p>But regardless of how one chooses to interpret the song, there&#8217;s no denying its infectious instrumental track. So it&#8217;s mystifying (and for me at least, maddening) that Bruce has yet to break out &#8220;Maria&#8217;s Bed&#8221; even once with the E Street Band.</p>\n<p>We know Bruce had to at least consider it, because he frequently summoned an imaginary E Street Band (to a surprisingly powerful effect) while playing it acoustically on the Devils &amp; Dust tour.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"bruce springsteen marias bed\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rNM38kPJaEM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8230;and two lucky crowds in Philly in Holmdel were treated to absolutely delightful full-band work-ups on the Seeger Sessions tour a year later, complete with strings and horns:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - &quot;Maria&#039;s Bed&quot; - Camden, 2006-06-20\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/X2Z6Cv7IGow?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>So surely, one would think, &#8220;Maria&#8217;s Bed&#8221; would be a sure-fire setlist contender for the next E Street Band Tour.</p>\n<p>And yet, it&#8217;s been more than a decade since &#8220;Maria&#8217;s Bed&#8221; last appeared, unless you count a single pre-show appearance in Belfast in 2013, but that was an impromptu acoustic performance (and arguably his least impressive live performance of the song).</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen (Belfast 2013) - Maria&#039;s Bed\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xcf3K0Pxt4w?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Chalk up its continuing absence from the E Street stage as just anther of the mysteries and puzzles of &#8220;Maria&#8217;s Bed.&#8221; It remains high on my chase list for the next tour.</p>\n<p><strong>Maria&#8217;s Bed<br />\nRecorded: </strong>1996-2004<strong><br />\nReleased:\u00a0</strong><em>Devils &amp; Dust\u00a0</em>(2005)<br />\n<strong>First performed: </strong>March 10, 2005 (Asbury Park, NJ)<strong><br />\nLast performed:</strong> July 20, 2013 (Belfast, Northern Ireland)</p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
