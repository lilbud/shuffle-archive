By November, he was developing a full-band arrangement with the E Street Band. We have bootlegs of both sessions, and each one traces a step in the song&#8217;s lyrical and musical development.</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s most fascinating to me about the acoustic demos is that they reflect not just one but several of the themes that Bruce was grappling with at the time. In fact, even some lyrical and musical elements show up at one point or another in &#8220;Chevrolet Deluxe,&#8221; only to find a permanent home elsewhere.</p>\n<p>Case in point: take a list to the first take in the clip below (about the first 1:20).</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen, &quot;Chevrolet Deluxe&quot; acoustic demos - takes 1 through 6\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VHVnjxXkqkI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Check out those opening lyrics:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>I had a wife and kid, and I tried to settle down</em><br />\n<em>I just wanted to live an honest life on the edge of an honest town</em></p>\n<p>&#8230;and compare to &#8220;Stolen Car,&#8221; which ultimately ended up on Bruce&#8217;s next album:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>I met a little girl and I settled down</em><br />\n<em>In a little house out on the edge of town</em></p>\n<p>That&#8217;s not to say that &#8220;Chevrolet Deluxe&#8221; morphed into &#8220;Stolen Car,&#8221; but it is to say that the concept of a settled life&#8211;the life you&#8217;re &#8220;supposed to&#8221; live but can&#8217;t quite be at peace with&#8211;is a theme (or at least a backdrop) that Bruce would turn to more than once. (&#8220;I had a job, I had a girl, I had something going Mister in this world&#8221; is another example.)</p>\n<p>The take goes on:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>But in the end they left me danglin&#8217; danglin&#8217; in the night</em><br />\n<em>And I went crazy tryin&#8217;, tryin&#8217; to walk that thin line</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Oh Chevrolet Deluxe, I bought you with all your accessories</em><br />\n<em>But Mister, I can&#8217;t keep my payments up</em><br />\n<em>I lie awake at night and I wonder if I&#8217;m tough enough</em><br />\n<em>To win back the hand of Chevrolet Deluxe</em></p>\n<p>The theme of the song is immediately established, and the car as metaphor for life drives it home: the singer bought into the whole concept&#8211;the wife, the family, the nice car&#8211;but can&#8217;t maintain it. On the surface, it&#8217;s about a car that&#8217;s too expensive to keep; below the surface, it&#8217;s his life that&#8217;s exacting a price.</p>\n<p>(The melody, too, is reminiscent of &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/03/04/roll-of-the-dice-the-river/\">The River</a>,&#8221; which Bruce had already debuted by this time, and I wonder if that&#8217;s accidental, deliberate, or that thematically similar song&#8217;s lingering presence in his subconsciousness.)</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s move on and listen to take #2, which runs from about 1:20 to 3:16 in the video below.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen, &quot;Chevrolet Deluxe&quot; acoustic demos - takes 1 through 6\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VHVnjxXkqkI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>They shut the power off down at the mill, and counted their time</em><br />\n<em>And these days when you ride down Main Street</em><br />\n<em>It&#8217;s just whitewashed windows and vacancy signs</em><br />\n<em>Did you ever think in the end your kids you would never believe</em><br />\n<em>That if you wouldn&#8217;t leave this old town, that it would leave me</em></p>\n<p>Too bad Bruce discarded that last line&#8211;it&#8217;s brilliant.

It doesn&#8217;t seem like Bruce has figured out how to merge the streams, though, and it&#8217;s almost jarring when his vocals suddenly clarify:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>But it was like all of a sudden there was a curse</em><br />\n<em>Things got bad and then they got worse</em></p>\n<p>That rhyme&#8211;curse/worse&#8211;is lifted from &#8220;The River,&#8221; and since that song had already been performed live around this time (at the No Nukes concerts), it seems likely that it&#8217;s just a placeholder here.</p>\n<p>So what happened next? Lyrically, we don&#8217;t know, but we do have some full-band takes from a couple of months later. Maddeningly, though, the vocals are so distant and muddy that it&#8217;s almost impossible to determine if the song had congealed at all. (Didn&#8217;t Bruce know his rehearsal sessions would leak for posterity?)</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen Chevrolet Deluxe #1\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/j23o8BSBHe8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>See what I mean? The second take is a bit more uptempo, but still unintelligible. At this point though, the song is certainly starting to gel musically, and the band is getting into it:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen Chevrolet Deluxe #2\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_horN30i4ug?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8230;and that&#8217;s where the tale of &#8220;Chevrolet Deluxe&#8221; ends, unfortunately. Whatever the reasons, Bruce abandoned it, scrapped it, and sold it for parts (and used them for later songs).</p>\n<p>I still wonder if there&#8217;s isn&#8217;t a fully fleshed-out version of &#8220;Chevrolet Deluxe&#8221; in the vaults somewhere&#8211;or at least developed enough for Bruce to apply some touch-up work (a la\u00a0<em>The Promise</em>) and release someday.
