That&#8217;s quite a bit longer than I originally promised, but I&#8217;ve realized I&#8217;m not going to be able to complete the physical archiving project before then.</p>\n<p>That said, here&#8217;s what you need to know about the <em>content</em>\u00a0 on the site:</p>\n<p><strong>Kingdom of Days</strong></p>\n<p><em>Kingdom of Days</em> will remain on the site until it closes in late 2027 or early 2028.\u00a0 However, due to the archiving software I am using and in order to optimize for print, you&#8217;ll notice the following changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The post titles will drop the &#8220;Kingdom of Days&#8221; prefix. So instead of &#8220;Kingdom of Days: January 5&#8221; as the title, you will see simply &#8220;January 5.&#8221;</li>\n<li>All of the &#8220;New for 20xx&#8221; article lead-ins will be deleted, along with all references to\u00a0<em>Where the Band Was</em> essays.</li>\n<li>Some entries will actually be updated for 2025 events, however I will not be republishing the articles, sending daily emails, or even adding a &#8220;New for 2026&#8221; lead-in. But if you happen to search for a particular date on the site, you may find it has an event for 2025 at the bottom of it.</li>\n<li><strong>Most importantly</strong>: The newspaper reviews and other images may be wildly out of order, perhaps placed nowhere near the part of the blog post that mentions them. This is a consequence of the tweaking I have to do for print layout purposes. It&#8217;s going to make most of the\u00a0<em>Kingdom of Days</em> entries quite frustrating to read through online, in my opinion, so I wanted to alert you to that. The actual text of each article will remain in chronological order, it&#8217;s just the images and media that will likely be out of order. Here&#8217;s an <a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2025/02/01/kingdom-of-days-february-1-2/\">example</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These changes are already in effect for all of the January entries from Jan 5th onward, as well as for February entries. I&#8217;ll be working my way through the remainder of the <em>Kingdom\u00a0</em>posts month by month throughout 2026.</p>\n<p><strong>Roll of the Dice, Cover Me, Meeting Across the River, </strong>and <strong>Where the Band Was</strong></p>\n<p>All of these articles will gradually and permanently disappear, starting in just a few days time. (Yes, even before the blog stops publishing.)</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll explain the schedule in a moment, but here&#8217;s why this is happening:</p>\n<p>There are <em>over two thousand</em> published posts on this site, and I&#8217;m in the process of archiving and collecting them into bound volumes for preservation. <em>Kingdom of Days</em> is relatively easy to coordinate. There&#8217;s a book for each month, and each post is already in the correct order on the site. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m okay leaving those posts on-line&#8211;they are in a separate section of the site, so they don&#8217;t clutter up my view as I work through the rest of the site.</p>\n<p>But: one consequence of my &#8220;roll of the dice&#8221; approach for the rest of the site is that there is absolutely no rhyme or reason to the organization of the rest of the site when I browse through posts in my admin view. Which makes it very confusing for me to plan out the archiving process and figure out what goes where.</p>\n<p>This is especially true for tracks that appear on multiple albums, never released outtakes, and Cover Me entries. So in order to\u00a0 preserve my sanity, I&#8217;m simply going to delete every post once they are compiled into book form and the books are printed.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s how that shakes out:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Every month, I&#8217;m going to archive one album&#8217;s worth of\u00a0<em>Roll of the Dice\u00a0</em>posts. That means all of the album tracks, plus all of the outtakes associated with the recording session of that album. Additionally, I will delete all of the\u00a0<em>Cover Me</em> entries for other artists covering songs from that particular album.<strong> You will see this begin in early December when all entries related to\u00a0<em>Greetings From Asbury Park, N.J.</em></strong><strong> are removed from the site.\u00a0</strong>In early January, all entries related to\u00a0<em>Tunnel of Love</em> will come down. (In true RotD fashion, I&#8217;m not going in any particular or pre-determined order.) This process will continue monthly throughout 2026 and 2027.</li>\n<li>For\u00a0<em>Kingdom of Days</em>, even though the master entries will remain (in altered form) on the site, all of the\u00a0<em>Where the Band Was</em> entries for a particular month will be deleted once the book for that month has been printed. All the January entries for <em>Where the Band Was</em> disappear in early December, the February entries go away in early January, etc.</li>\n<li><em>Cover Me\u00a0</em>and\u00a0<em>Meeting Across the River</em> posts will also disappear in batches throughout 2026, but I don&#8217;t know how to predict or telegraph which ones and when, as I am still figuring out the contents and schedule for those books. But the same principle applies&#8211;once printed, they are gone.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What that means all-up: pretty soon the site is going to be a mess of &#8220;page not found&#8221; errors, which is going to annoy both users of the site and Google, who will probably quickly demote this site from the high search engine placement it&#8217;s enjoyed over the years. I apologize in advance for this. I will be removing links from the &#8220;Original Songs&#8221; and &#8220;Cover Songs&#8221; pages to reflect the deleted entries, but I will <em>not</em> be removing all the various cross-reference links in essays throughout the site.</p>\n<p>With all that said, here are some options if you&#8217;ve enjoyed this site&#8217;s content and don&#8217;t want to lose access to it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Internet Archive&#8217;s<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/\"> Wayback Machine</a> will likely preserve previous versions of the site for a long time to come. If you&#8217;ve never used it, it&#8217;s very easy&#8211;just choose a date in the past, and the Wayback Machine will send your browser back in time to a snapshot of the entire site from that date. This is the easiest way to enjoy the site&#8217;s content even after I close up shop, and it&#8217;s free. I recommend it.</li>\n<li>Reader Andy Swanson tipped me off to a tool called <a href=\"https://www.httrack.com/\">HTTrrack</a>, which basically downloads an entire web site to your hard drive for off-line viewing. I&#8217;ve never used it, and I suspect it might take up a pretty big chunk of your hard drive if it doesn&#8217;t fill it completely, but it seems like a viable way to mirror the site (as it stands today) to your personal computer.</li>\n<li>There are several ebook generators that can create ebooks for a pretty low price. I&#8217;ve heard good things about both <a href=\"https://blogbooker.com/\">Blogbooker</a> and<a href=\"https://printmy.blog/\"> printmy.blog</a>, although I have not used either and therefore can&#8217;t endorse either. I don&#8217;t have the time to create ebooks before I archive the site, but if you want to do for your own personal library, I have no problem with that.</li>\n<li>You can piggyback on my personal book orders as I make them each month. Each month in 2026, I will be archiving one album&#8217;s worth of\u00a0<em>Roll of the Dice</em> and one month&#8217;s worth of <em>Kingdom of Days.\u00a0</em>I will also be archiving\u00a0<em>Cover Me\u00a0</em>and\u00a0<em>Meeting Across the River</em> at various times throughout the year. This is by far the most expensive way to go, and it involves a great deal of patience, as it&#8217;s a two-year slow-motion process. But if you would like to stay apprised of what&#8217;s coming each month along with ordering instructions, you can sign up for a weekly or monthly newsletter <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc6QS8QQs84TUjNKwQZrsAE-IChg65xM7mAoJ7hwdWRcnamTQ/viewform?usp=dialog\">here</a>. (The order window for the first\u00a0<em>Roll of the Dice, Cover Me, and Kingdom of Days\u00a0</em>volumes closes at 11:59pm PST on Sunday, November 30, so please don&#8217;t delay if you want those volumes.) There&#8217;s no mark-up on these, you pay the same price that I do for my personal copies.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That&#8217;s it for now. My apologies for the length of this update, but I wanted to make sure I keep you informed of important changes to the site as early as I can so you can plan accordingly.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll probably send one final update when the site wraps in early January, but again and as always: thank you for reading, today and for the past eight years.</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>Happy Thanksgiving weekend to my American readers, and happy holiday season to all!
