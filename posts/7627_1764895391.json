But once in a while I found a gem like Bruce leaving his expired Amex in an L.A. restaurant. And who would have expected him to turn up backstage at a Melissa Manchester taping? Both of those anecdotes turn up in these pages, and discovering them was my absolute favorite part of compiling\u00a0<em>Kingdom of Days<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>Also fun: reading all the newspaper reviews. Often I had several to choose from. (In the early days of Bruce&#8217;s career, it wasn&#8217;t unusual for a city to have multiple local papers plus independent suburban ones.)<\/p>\n<p>I tried to pick ones that were provocative, prescient, funny, or somewhat against the grain. I think my personal favorite in this volume is from February 16th, by a writer who refuses to be &#8220;brainwashed&#8221; but who you can tell is struggling mightily to resist.<\/p>\n<p>Letters to the editor were often entertaining as well, and there&#8217;s a delightfully indignant one in these pages for you to discover.<\/p>\n<p>Not fun: figuring out what to do with fake news. Or even figuring out if it&#8217;s fake to begin with.<\/p>\n<p>You might think that a recent phenomenon, but then there are things like the rumored Central Park show that never happened. Was that ever a real possibility? Beats me. But it generated quite a bit of newspaper coverage for a week in February 1992, so I included it. But then again, so did a rumored gym affair about fifteen years ago, and I didn&#8217;t include that.<\/p>\n<p>Even including real news could be discomforting at times. What to do with coverage of Bruce&#8217;s DWI\u00a0 charge? I included it because Bruce has made light of it and &#8220;United States vs. Bruce Springsteen&#8221; caps become a solidarity symbol among artists. But that part wasn&#8217;t fun either.<\/p>\n<p>But by far, the part I struggled with the most was all of the &#8220;in the wild&#8221; Springsteen sightings. I sometimes included interesting personal encounters from the pre-social media era, but if I were to included entries for every time Bruce was spotted at Federici&#8217;s, the beach, or out and about in Asbury Park in recent years, this would be a much bigger book.<\/p>\n<p>And yet, you&#8217;ll find some from time to time. I tried to only include ones that had an interesting angle to them, but in the end it was just a judgement call (and in a couple of lucky cases in later volumes, self-indulgence).<\/p>\n<p>In the end, it&#8217;s all a judgment call. Maybe I left out a few things I shouldn&#8217;t have; maybe I should have dropped a few things I included.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll leave it to others to pick up the baton and build a bigger and better &#8220;This Day in Springsteen History.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>I hope someone does.<\/p>\n<p>(c) December 4, 2025<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The shows were the easy part.
