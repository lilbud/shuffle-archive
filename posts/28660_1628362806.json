Sometimes it was a classic like <em>The Long Goodbye</em> or\u00a0<em>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.</em> More often it was a lesser-known tale, and occasionally it was a story destined to become a classic. (Its third-season adaptation of <em>Casino Royale</em>, for example, was the first-ever screen adaptation of a James Bond novel.)</p>\n<div style=\"width: 640px;\" class=\"wp-video\"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\">document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->\n<video class=\"wp-video-shortcode\" id=\"video-28660-1\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" preload=\"metadata\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"video/mp4\" src=\"https://archive.org/download/ClimaxCasinoRoyale/Climax-casinoRoyale.mp4?_=1\" /><a href=\"https://archive.org/download/ClimaxCasinoRoyale/Climax-casinoRoyale.mp4\">https://archive.org/download/ClimaxCasinoRoyale/Climax-casinoRoyale.mp4</a></video></div>\n<p>(Yes, I included that clip just for the introduction of Bond&#8230;\u00a0<em>Jimmy</em>\u00a0 Bond.)</p>\n<p>Midway through the 1956-57 season,\u00a0<em>Climax!\u00a0</em>featured an episode entitled &#8220;Let It Be Me,&#8221; featuring an intriguing synopsis: &#8220;Corruption in the recording industry plays out just as the music plays in. &#8221;</p>\n<p>The music that played in was sung by the episode&#8217;s featured actress, Jill Corey. Corey&#8217;s performance of &#8220;Let It Be Me&#8221; proved popular enough for it to be released as a single, which peaked at #57 on the Billboard Hot 100.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"1st (English-language) RECORDING OF: Let It Be Me - Jill Corey (1957)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mKiLw5D9I5o?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;Let it Be Me&#8221; was credited in part to American lyricist Manny Curtis, but also to French songwriter Gilbert B\u00e9caud.</p>\n<p>B\u00e9caud, who was known in France as &#8220;Monsieur 100,000 Volts&#8221; based on his electrifying performances\u00a0 (not unlike a certain New Jersey rocker), had recorded the song in its original French form as &#8220;Je t&#8217;appartiens&#8221; in 1955. In the video below, we can see why B\u00e9caud earned his nickname.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Je t&#039;appartiens Gilbert B\u00e9caud\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/k4n4UQtJRpw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>B\u00e9caud&#8217;s original has considerably more vigor than Corey&#8217;s sentimental reading, but it was Corey&#8217;s arrangement that influenced The Everly Brothers when Phil and Don covered it in 1959.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"The Everly Brothers -  LET IT BE ME\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lvA-STM7oJk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>That version of &#8220;Let It Be Me&#8221; was considerably more successful, notching as high as #7 and inspiring an even more successful cover by \u00a0Betty Everett and Jerry Butler that went to #5 in 1964.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Let It Be Me - Jerry Butler &amp; Betty Everett - 1964.\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YwTh4OkPTb0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>While the song&#8217;s lush orchestration and gorgeous harmonies contribute much to its enduring popularity, there&#8217;s no doubt that part of the allure of &#8220;Let It Be Me&#8221; comes from the unabashedly romantic lyrics. Perhaps that&#8217;s also why the song was on Bruce Springsteen&#8217;s mind throughout his 1988 Tunnel of Love Express Tour.</p>\n<p>While Bruce never actually performed &#8220;Let It Be Me&#8221; in concert, he performed it at sound check frequently&#8211;and three of those performances were actually captured on tape.</p>\n<p>The earliest of the three was in Chapel Hill, just eight days into the tour. In this performance, we can eavesdrop on Bruce and the E Street Band working out their plan of attack for the first ninety seconds or so before the band kicks in. Bruce&#8217;s vocals enter about a minute later, and the E Streeters quickly coalesce in a beautiful performance.</p>\n<div id=\"v-a3W1Ufzd-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='426' src='https://videopress.com/embed/a3W1Ufzd?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>Just a few short weeks later in Atlanta, Bruce took another crack at &#8220;Let It Be Me,&#8221; this time in a much more intimate arrangement that centered around vocals by Bruce and Patti (who were growing much more intimate as well).</p>\n<div id=\"v-xRkEfMqZ-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='568' src='https://videopress.com/embed/xRkEfMqZ?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>&#8220;Let It Be Me&#8221; next surfaced on May 6th, before Bruce&#8217;s show in Tacoma. What makes this last performance notable is the lead vocal switch from Bruce to Nils at around the 45-second mark. The soaring melody of &#8220;Let It Be Me&#8221; proved perfectly suited for Nils&#8217; range, and by the final verse the song belonged fully to him.</p>\n<div id=\"v-yjejxWkw-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='426' src='https://videopress.com/embed/yjejxWkw?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>Each of those three performances featured different arrangements, which suggest that Bruce never quite hit on an approach he was satisfied with.
