In fact, while the site of John Henry&#8217;s famous race is up for debate (a West Virginia railroad lays claim with a memorial statue, however), John Henry himself may have been a New Jerseyan born exactly a century before the state&#8217;s most famous current citizen&#8211;so says researcher Scott Reynolds Nelson, at least.</p>\n<p>The ballad of &#8220;John Henry&#8221; changes and grows as all great legends do, from the first known recording in 1924 by Fiddlin&#8217; John Carson&#8230;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"John Henry Blues\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/N8a-d-GAwKA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>to Pete Seeger&#8217;s version that inspired Bruce&#8217;s own.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"John Henry -Pete Seeger\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/A9Zt0O2lyhk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>But even Pete claimed not to know the song&#8217;s original lyrics and melody. Those appear to be lost to time, since the ballad first started circulating in the 1870s, a good half-century before it was ever recorded.</p>\n<p>(In a curious side note, Woody Guthrie took inspiration from &#8220;John Henry,&#8221; lifting its melody for his own song, &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/05/24/cover-me-tom-joad/\">Tom Joad</a>&#8221; &#8212; which means that in a roundabout way, &#8220;John Henry&#8221; also inspired Bruce to write &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/10/17/roll-of-the-dice-the-ghost-of-tom-joad/\">The Ghost of Tom Joad.</a>&#8220;)</p>\n<p>Bruce took inspiration from Seeger&#8217;s version, arranging &#8220;John Henry&#8221; as a celebratory heroic epic rather than a tragic work song.</p>\n<p>On March 19, 2005, Bruce took a break from rehearsals for his upcoming solo acoustic tour and summoned The Gotham Playboys (the core of what would eventually become the Sessions Band) to his home and recorded &#8220;John Henry,&#8221; along with seven other folk songs that would be released the following year (and one that still isn&#8217;t). Remarkably, that session was captured on film, and Bruce looks and sounds like he was having the time of his life.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - John Henry (The Seeger Sessions)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bqxjHzff-Qo?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Bruce had a great time performing it on stage too. He featured &#8220;John Henry&#8221; prominently and early in the set throughout his 2006 tour, and even an on-stage wardrobe malfunction with his pants in New Orleans couldn&#8217;t throw Bruce off his game. (His officially released video omits that part.)</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"John Henry (Live at the New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival, 2006)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hIh74VC7oXc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;John Henry&#8221; isn&#8217;t one of the Seeger Sessions songs to make the E Street transition, though. While it appeared in every show of the Seeger Sessions Tour, it hasn&#8217;t been heard from since that tour&#8217;s finale in Belfast.</p>\n<p>But even if Bruce never performs &#8220;John Henry&#8221; again, we&#8217;ll certainly be hearing versions from other artists.
