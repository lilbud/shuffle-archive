Steve Van Zandt rode to the rescue, creating an all-star revue called, well, The Asbury Park All-Star Revue, consisting of the Jukes, the E Street Band, Ronnie and Bruce.</p>\n<p>The set list for each show (there were three across the two nights) consisted primarily of Southside songs, with a few Spector and Springsteen songs sprinkled in. But late in the encores came a special duet of a song Bruce hadn&#8217;t performed in more than three years and never would again.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s one of those special performances, and the end of the line for Bruce&#8217;s custody of &#8220;You Mean So Much to Me.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"v-kwyJ1epn-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='426' src='https://videopress.com/embed/kwyJ1epn?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>The story of &#8220;You Mean So Much to Me&#8221; continues beyond its last E Street stage appearance.
