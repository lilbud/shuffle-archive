That&#8217;s what happened when Nico Mirandola dropped me a line and invited me to check out his band Free Redemption, and their cover of &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/06/05/roll-of-the-dice-im-goin-down/\">I&#8217;m Goin&#8217; Down</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Since I&#8217;m one of the more than four billion people under a stay-at-home order at the moment, I was glad for a momentary diversion, so I watched it right away.\u00a0I&#8217;m glad I did, and if you take a few minutes to watch it with me, I think you will be, too.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"I&#039;m Going Down\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_O6ge4c1RSU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Nico and his band gifted us with a wonderful arrangement of &#8220;I&#8217;m Goin&#8217; Down&#8221; &#8212; familiar enough to be recognizable but fresh enough to make us listen to the song with newfound attention.</p>\n<p>As it turns out, that was their goal from the outset. Free Redemption is a new band&#8211;they&#8217;ve only been around since 2019&#8211;formed in Italy not just to pay tribute to Bruce&#8217;s music, but to re-interpret and re-arrange it so that the listener pays new and closer attention to Bruce&#8217;s storytelling and poetry.</p>\n<p>They certainly succeeded with this listener. What I admire most is the way Free Redemption manages to accent the song&#8217;s pathos without overplaying it. I&#8217;ve always felt that Bruce&#8217;s album arrangement&#8211;as much as I love it&#8211;is just a little too playful for a casual listener to catch the simmering frustration at its core.</p>\n<p>Free Redemption&#8217;s version of &#8220;I&#8217;m Goin&#8217; Down&#8221; is easily my favorite of the many, many covers of this particular song out there. Well done, Nico, and thanks for sharing your music with us! I&#8217;m looking forward to hearing your next re-invention.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/FreeRedemption/\">Check out more from Free Redemption</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Nico Mirandola, </strong>lead vocal, harmonica, guitar<strong><br />\n</strong><strong>Ivan Sacchi,</strong> guitar, backing vocals<strong><br />\n</strong><strong>Michele Leoni,</strong> bass, backing vocals<strong><br />\n</strong><strong>Gianluca Garavaso, </strong>drums, backing vocals</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>Free Redemption is a new band out of Italy, and to call them a tribute band would be a vast disservice.
