It&#8217;s a song that resonates with any couple that can see the light at the end of the child-raising tunnel but isn&#8217;t sure anymore who their partner will be come daylight.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Tell me baby</em><br />\n<em>Have we lost everything that we had before</em><br />\n<em>What do you do in the day</em><br />\n<em>When I walk out the door</em><br />\n<em>I can see you made up your mind</em><br />\n<em>And I know our love&#8217;s on the line</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Love&#8217;s on the line, our love&#8217;s on the line</em><br />\n<em>Love&#8217;s on the line, our love&#8217;s on the line</em><br />\n<em>Love&#8217;s on the line, our love&#8217;s on the line</em></p>\n<p>There&#8217;s trouble in paradise from the outset. Our narrator knows that he and his partner have grown distant, and what&#8217;s more: he suspects his wife has already passed the point of no return.</p>\n<p>But if the verses of &#8220;Love&#8217;s on the Line&#8221; are brooding and contemplative, the four-word chorus (featuring Bruce prominently on backing vocals) is a cry of anguish. Bruce plays on the meaning of &#8220;on the line&#8221;&#8211;we&#8217;re meant to hear it as &#8220;at stake,&#8221; as if their love is still salvageable. However, a closer listen reveals a deeper meaning: their love has flatlined. They&#8217;re just going through the motions. And with love faded, dissatisfaction and distrust set in.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>With each passing day</em><br />\n<em>I gotta watch more and more what I say to you</em><br />\n<em>I can feel your eyes looking through me</em><br />\n<em>As I sit at the table at dinnertime</em><br />\n<em>I can feel our love&#8217;s on the line</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Love&#8217;s on the line, our love&#8217;s on the line</em><br />\n<em>Love&#8217;s on the line, our love&#8217;s on the line</em><br />\n<em>Love&#8217;s on the line, our love&#8217;s on the line</em></p>\n<p>What&#8217;s fascinating about this verse is how Bruce abandons his rhyme scheme, as if the narrator is so caught up in his thoughts he forgets he&#8217;s singing.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a gorgeously wistful nostalgic E Street instrumental break here&#8211;one of the best on record, in fact. (But while one would be forgiven for assuming that&#8217;s the Big Man on saxophone, it&#8217;s actually Joey Stann&#8217;s solo.)</p>\n<p>Bruce&#8217;s last verse shreds on its own power, but Gary absolutely nails his vocals, heightening the tension and escalating the emotion in what may be my favorite Bonds&#8217; performance on record. I&#8217;m not sure Bruce could have matched its potency if he&#8217;d released his own version.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I watch our kids</em><br />\n<em>Growin&#8217; up, going to school</em><br />\n<em>Is there anything else for us now</em><br />\n<em>Are we both just fools</em><br />\n<em>Wasting our precious time</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>At night we lay in bed</em><br />\n<em>But it&#8217;s like you&#8217;re not even there</em><br />\n<em>There&#8217;s something real bad</em><br />\n<em>Going wrong somewhere</em><br />\n<em>Last night I heard you cry</em><br />\n<em>And I know our love&#8217;s on the line</em></p>\n<p>&#8220;Love&#8217;s on the Line&#8221; is a true hidden gem, one of Bruce&#8217;s best River-era compositions and one of Bonds&#8217; finest performances. It flies under the radar, but it&#8217;s a song and an album that should be in any fan&#8217;s collection.</p>\n<p><strong>Love&#8217;s on the Line<br />\nRecorded:</strong> January &#8211; February 1982<br />\n<strong>Released:\u00a0</strong><em>On the Line</em> (1982)<br />\n<strong>Never performed</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>Bruce&#8217;s original River-era composition, a stellar E Street Band performance and Gary&#8217;s passionate vocals make for a standout track on an album full of them. </p>\n", "protected": false}, "author": 1, "featured_media": 32189, "comment_status": "open", "ping_status": "open", "sticky": false, "template": "", "format": "standard", "meta": {"_monsterinsights_skip_tracking": false, "_monsterinsights_sitenote_active": false, "_monsterinsights_sitenote_note": "", "_monsterinsights_sitenote_category": 0, "jetpack_post_was_ever_published": false, "_jetpack_newsletter_access": "", "_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs": false, "_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id": 0, "_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content": false, "_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content": false, "footnotes": "", "jetpack_publicize_message": "", "jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled": true, "jetpack_social_post_already_shared": true, "jetpack_social_options": {"image_generator_settings": {"template": "highway", "default_image_id": 0, "font": "", "enabled": false}, "version": 2}}, "categories": [4, 5, 3], "tags": [80, 3373], "class_list": ["post-32111", "post", "type-post", "status-publish", "format-standard", "has-post-thumbnail", "hentry", "category-cover-me", "category-meeting-across-the-river", "category-roll-of-the-dice", "tag-gary-u-s-bonds", "tag-loves-on-the-line"], "aioseo_notices": [], "jetpack_publicize_connections": [], "jetpack_featured_media_url": "https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ontheline.jpg?fit=1500%2C1500&ssl=1", "jetpack_sharing_enabled": true, "jetpack_shortlink": "https://wp.me/p9w3Lk-8lV", "jetpack_likes_enabled": true, "jetpack-related-posts": [{"id": 15412, "url": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/01/17/matr-bruce-springsteen-and-gary-u-s-bonds-soul-deep/", "url_meta": {"origin": 32111, "position": 0}, "title": "MatR: Bruce Springsteen and Gary U.S. Bonds: Soul Deep", "author": "Ken", "date": "January 17, 2020", "format": false, "excerpt": "Did he or didn't he?
