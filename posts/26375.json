(My first ever jury duty!)</p>\n<p>Organized by Noi &amp; Springsteen,\u00a0<em>Cover Me</em> recognizes the best and most inventive covers of Springsteen songs. As with last year, the contest is expected to draw entries from artists around the world, and if the entries are as stellar as last year&#8217;s were, I&#8217;m going to face some tough decisions ahead.</p>\n<p>What sets this event apart from others is that the artists are\u00a0<em>required</em> to reinterpret Bruce&#8217;s material&#8211;they can&#8217;t just submit a faithful performance of Bruce&#8217;s original arrangement. That makes this event an exciting one for Springsteen fans who think they&#8217;ve heard it all.</p>\n<p>(I&#8217;ve featured some of the contestants on the Shuffle before&#8211;take a look and listen to some of the great entries from last year <a href=\"https://www.noiespringsteen.com/archivio/contest-2020/\">here</a>.)</p>\n<p>Full rules and regulations are on the main contest page&#8211;if
