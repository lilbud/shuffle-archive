Under the guise of rehearsing for<em>\u00a0Tunnel of Love</em>, I\u2019m teaching you the guitar parts. But somehow, you got around to playing me this next song, and I remember thinking, &#8220;Oh my God, this woman can write.&#8221; And it totally made me twice as scared as I was anyway. It was like, whoa, I think I saw your talent for the first time, outside of just your voice. It was a pretty intense moment. &#8212; <em>Bruce Springsteen to Patti Scialfa, From My Home to Yours Volume 9</em></span></p></blockquote>\n<p>Until that revelatory confession, I&#8217;d always wondered why Patti chose to play &#8220;Valerie&#8221; during her promotional tour for <em>Rumble Doll</em>, her 1993 debut album.</p>\n<p>Not that &#8220;Valerie&#8221; is a bad song&#8211;quite the opposite, as illustrated by Bruce&#8217;s awestruck reaction to his first listen.\u00a0But it wasn&#8217;t the album&#8217;s first single&#8211;that honor belonged to &#8220;Lucky Girl.&#8221; Or even its second (&#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/10/02/meeting-across-the-river-patti-scialfa-and-bruce-springsteen-as-long-as-i-can-be-with-you/\">As Long As I (Can Be With You)</a>&#8220;).</p>\n<p>In fact, &#8220;Valerie&#8221; was never released as a single, and yet during a rare in-studio radio appearance in July 1993 (the month that <em>Rumble Doll </em>was released), &#8220;Valerie&#8221; is the song she chose to play.</p>\n<div id=\"v-6l1B7wRG-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='426' src='https://videopress.com/embed/6l1B7wRG?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>Infatuation with its songwriter aside, it&#8217;s no wonder that Bruce was so taken with &#8220;Valerie.&#8221; With its gorgeous, evocative metaphor-rich lyrics, lush backing track, and failed love affair set against an exotic backdrop, &#8220;Valerie&#8221; is exactly the kind of song Bruce loved to write himself.</p>\n<p>Patti was kind when the DJ called &#8220;Valerie&#8221; a &#8220;buddy-girl type of song&#8221; in the clip above. That&#8217;s most certainly <em>not</em> when &#8220;Valerie&#8221; is about.\u00a0In fact, &#8220;Valerie&#8221; isn&#8217;t about Valerie at all. The titular character serves no purpose in the song&#8217;s story other than as an off-screen friend with whom the narrator shares her letter of regret and heartbreak.</p>\n<p>The narrator of &#8220;Valerie&#8221; followed her lover on a great adventure, only to find herself alone and abandoned. He&#8217;s been gone for three years now, but she&#8217;d still sacrifice anything and everything to recapture that feeling of intense love.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Valerie\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RXQyuidSUFw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>The second verse of &#8220;Valerie&#8221; may be the most artful lyric Patti has ever written:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Sixteen days since I left Corona</em><br />\n<em>And I traveled to this carnival town near Alberndeel</em><br />\n<em>And I rode the coaster there on the fairground</em><br />\n<em>Twisted backbone of a beast that never heels</em><br />\n<em>And I left some skin on fortune&#8217;s wheel</em></p>\n<p>I mean, come on: whose jaw\u00a0<em>wouldn&#8217;t</em> drop when hearing that verse for the first time?</p>\n<p>&#8220;Valerie&#8221; is an intensely sad song. The final verse leaves our narrator in a metaphorical prison, hiding out on the border between the lost love she can&#8217;t let go of and the family and friends who await her return. (If there&#8217;s a Springsteen song that&#8217;s closest to &#8220;Valerie&#8221; in theme and power, it&#8217;s &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/11/04/roll-of-the-dice-jackson-cage/\">Jackson Cage</a>.&#8221;)</p>\n<p>And yet despite its beauty and personal significance, Patti and Bruce never performed &#8220;Valerie&#8221; together until (of all places) the Seeger Sessions Tour in 2006.</p>\n<p>Bruce kicked off the autumn leg of the tour with a mini-tour of Italy, a country to which Bruce and Patti have long had a deep and romantic connection. It amounted to a working vacation of sorts, but by the time the tour reached Verona, familial duties called Patti back stateside.</p>\n<p>Parting must have been sweet sorrow, though, because Bruce did something on stage that night that he&#8217;d never done before on tour: he featured one of Patti&#8217;s own songs in the set list and stepped back into a supporting role, ceding the spotlight to his wife.</p>\n<p>That song, of course, was &#8220;Valerie,&#8221; and thanks to Bruce&#8217;s radio show this summer, I now understand why they chose that song. I was lucky enough to be in the audience that night, and it remains one of my favorite moments at a Springsteen show. The audio has circulated pretty widely, but the video is a lot harder to come by, so I&#8217;ve included it here.</p>\n<p>Enjoy Patti Scialfa, backed by Bruce Springsteen and The Sessions Band, performing &#8220;Valerie.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"v-VEBgViEj-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='568'

Bruce&#8217;s has, but in 1999 Emmylou Harris and Linda Ronstadt chose &#8220;Valerie&#8221; for their duet album,\u00a0<em>Western Wall: The Tucson Sessions.&#8221; </em></p>\n<p>The song loses some of its power when performed as a duet, however, and even though Harris and Ronstadt are both superb vocalists, neither quite manage to summon the brave vulnerability that &#8220;Valerie&#8221; (like much of Patti&#8217;s catalog) requires.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Valerie\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\"
