(A note here: while I greatly appreciate the folks who contribute transcriptions\u00a0 of unreleased outtakes to springsteenlyrics.com, in this case, I think their interpretation is wide of the mark. I&#8217;ve relied on my own ears below.)</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Baby&#8217;s got on her new dress tonight</em><br />\n<em>With her hair piled high she looks so right</em><br />\n<em>And I will not be denied</em><br />\n<em>All I wanted is to be the one to try</em></p>\n<p>At this point, we have to talk about the title this song is commonly referred to by bootleg-collecting fans: &#8220;Castaway.&#8221; That name comes from the first line that accompanies the entrance of the E Street Band.</p>\n<p>Except I don&#8217;t believe that&#8217;s what Bruce is singing at all. Maddeningly, I can&#8217;t make it out clearly, but I&#8217;m quite sure he&#8217;s not singing &#8220;castaway.&#8221; Instead of &#8220;away,&#8221; I hear &#8220;alone,&#8221; and given the content of the rest of the song&#8211;a lonely wanderer,\u00a0 a pariah perhaps, searching for his love in the night&#8211;I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;m correct.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve used &#8220;cast alone&#8221; below, which works, but it&#8217;s a bit clumsy and I suspect Bruce is saying something else instead of &#8220;cast.&#8221; If you can figure it out, please comment and let me know. (<strong>Update:</strong> reader Andy commented below that he hears &#8220;dance alone,&#8221; and I think he&#8217;s right. I hear it now, and if fits the context perfectly. Thanks, Andy!) Nevertheless, I acknowledge I&#8217;m in the minority, and although the official name in Bruce&#8217;s session logs is &#8220;The Ballad,&#8221; most sources you encounter will refer to it by its more common, fan-defined name.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>And now cast alone, cast alone, tonight all night</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;m walking deep beneath your lies</em><br />\n<em>I call your name, no answer comes</em><br />\n<em>While I am wondering what have I done</em><br />\n<em>Can you go be alone, all alone</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>And now baby knows I&#8217;ll be there tonight</em><br />\n<em>To rest in my last town for a while</em><br />\n<em>We&#8217;ll leave to exit the beginning of</em><br />\n<em>What am I wondering, I don&#8217;t know why</em><br />\n<em>I want an answer tonight</em></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s probably best not to spend too much time obsessing over the lyrics&#8211;more likely than not, many of them are bluffed per Bruce&#8217;s habit while working on new material. But the thrust of the song is clear: &#8220;The Ballad&#8221; follows a lonely heartbroken man, doomed to wander the land in search of a lost love.</p>\n<p><strong>The Ballad<br />\nRecorded:\u00a0</strong>October 14, 1977<br />\n<strong>Never released</strong><br />\n<strong>Never performed</strong></p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
