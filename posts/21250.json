But I included a parenthetical qualifier: &#8220;in the U.S., at least.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Because even though 10,000 Maniacs took the song all the way to #11 in the U.S. in 1993 (compared to Patti Smith, who only reached #13 in 1978), there&#8217;s another version of &#8220;Because the Night&#8221; that became a global smash hit that very same year.</p>\n<p>In 1992, an Italian Eurodance trio called CO.RO. teamed up with vocalist Emanuela Gubinelli (a.k.a. Taleesa) and took &#8220;Because the Night&#8221; all the way to the Top Ten&#8211;not just in Italy (where it hit #7), but also Greece (#8), Belgium (#7), France (#6), and all the way to #1 in Spain.</p>\n<p>Their version of &#8220;Because the Night&#8221; was more than a cover&#8211;it was also a mash-up, prominently sampling Depeche Mode&#8217;s &#8220;Master and Servant,&#8221; making for one of the most unlikely Springsteen pairings ever.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Because the Night - Co.Ro.
