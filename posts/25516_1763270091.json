Both versions charted, which probably would have annoyed the original artist just a tiny bit if he hadn&#8217;t already broken through on his own by the time the second one hit.</p>\n<p>Their 1975 album <em>Nightingales &amp; Bombers </em>led off with a lengthy, groovy cover of &#8220;Spirits in the Night&#8221; (the &#8220;s&#8221; would maddeningly come and go over the years with various edits and re-issues).</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Manfred Mann&#039;s Earth Band  - Spirits in the night\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gvJ6o1PC4pA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;Spirits in the Night&#8221; was released as a single in the U.K. a full month before Bruce became a mega-star with the release of <em>Born to Run; </em>a U.S. version followed in \u00a0early 1976.</p>\n<p>The single was a heavily edited (for length) version of the album track with vocalist Mick Rogers, and despite some early publicity (including the band&#8217;s appearance on Dutch television show <em>TopPop</em> below), &#8220;Spirits in the Night&#8221; performed disappointingly, peaking at #97 on the Billboard Hot 100.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Manfred Mann&#039;s Earth Band - Spirits In The Night - 19-09-1975 \u2022 TopPop\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CPcSYVlg-2M?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>It was probably just a little too soon.</p>\n<p>Because while Mann&#8217;s version of &#8220;Spirit in the Night&#8221; was flying under the radar, Bruce was continuing to build his breakout buzz. When the Earth Band scored a mega-hit the following year with &#8220;Blinded by the Light,&#8221; the band figured maybe they should take another run at their earlier cover.</p>\n<p>But rather than re-release their original 1975 recording featuring Rogers (who had left the band shortly after the release of <em>Nightingales &amp; Bombers</em>), they decided to record a completely new overdub with new vocalist Chris Thompson.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Manfred Mann&#039;s Earth Band-Spirit In The Night (1977/The Roaring Silence version)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Agd3tgN97GU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>This new version was released in 1977 (after &#8220;Blinded by the Light&#8221; finished its run on the charts), and this time the band took it all the way to #40 on the Billboard Hot 100.</p>\n<p>The Earth Band&#8217;s early trilogy of high-flying <em>Greetings from Asbury Park</em> covers remains an unequaled feat in Springsteen history.</p>\n<p>But while they haven&#8217;t added any new Springsteen songs to their studio albums in the four decades since, they did add a fourth one to their live repertoire.
