So when a fan requested he play &#8220;Highway Patrolman&#8221; in Kalamazoo, he knew what was going to happen when he sang about the Michigan Line.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When I sing &#8216;Highway Patrolman&#8217;, the word <em>Michigan</em> is gonna come up. And when the word <em>Michigan</em> comes up, somebody is gonna shout&#8211;either filled with local pride or just because for some reason, that&#8217;s the strange thing that people do when they hear the name of their home state.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But then inspiration struck:</p>\n<p>&#8220;Wait a minute: instead of being worried that <em>Michigan</em> is gonna inspire applause, what I should be thinking is: that\u00b4s where the money is! The money is in writing songs with people\u00b4s hometowns&#8230;&nbsp; It really doesn\u00b4t matter what you say in the song at all as long as their hometown comes up regularly!&#8221;</p>\n<p>So in the ten minutes before he took the stage that night (as his own legend would have it), Bruce wrote a song. &#8220;And I do have to tell you it\u00b4s one of the greatest songs I\u00b4ve ever written! Gonna make &#8217;em forget all about that &#8216;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/09/21/roll-of-the-dice-born-in-the-u-s-a/\">Born in the U.S.A</a>.&#8217; bullshit!&#8221;</p>\n<p>And so without further ado, let&#8217;s take a listen to one of the greatest songs Bruce ever wrote.</p>\n<div id=\"v-g3zHwJLi-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='426' src='https://videopress.com/embed/g3zHwJLi?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>&#8220;In Michigan&#8221; lives up to its promise, in that the name&nbsp;<em>Michigan</em> comes up a lot. Which is pretty much the sum total of analysis warranted by this song of indulgent resilience.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px\"><em>Well my mother rolled over and died in Michigan</em><br />\n<em>My dog got hit by a truck and I cried in Michigan</em><br />\n<em>I got drunk and puked up my guts in Michigan</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px\"><em>But I&#8217;m alright, I&#8217;m alright, I&#8217;m alright, I&#8217;m alright</em><br />\n<em>And man I&#8217;m riding here tonight in Michigan</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px\"><em>I ran a race and came in dead last in Michigan</em><br />\n<em>Yeah, I shot myself in the ass in Michigan</em><br />\n<em>I was lookin&#8217; for someplace to feel free</em><br />\n<em>But they busted me for just being me</em><br />\n<em>In Michigan</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px\"><em>But alright, it&#8217;s alright, it&#8217;s alright, it&#8217;s alright</em><br />\n<em>And baby I&#8217;m riding high tonight in Michigan</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px\"><em>I ran into a little bad luck in Michigan</em><br />\n<em>I met a woman and for seven days and seven nights all we did is fuck in Michigan</em><br />\n<em>Baby I&#8217;m running late but you got here one hell of a state</em><br />\n<em>In Michigan</em></p>\n<p>The song went over so well that he brought it back for an encore two nights later. He closed the show with it, in fact, in a performance greatly improved by the gusto that comes from knowing you&#8217;ve written a surefire hit.</p>\n<div id=\"v-gbgaaWKC-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='568' src='https://videopress.com/embed/gbgaaWKC?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>Bruce also made some minor lyrical adjustments that night. (It was Bob Dole who fell on his ass, and a seven-day Macarena marathon.)</p>\n<p>Despite the roaring approval from the audience, Bruce never again brought out &#8220;In Michigan&#8221; for his Great Lakes State audiences. Perhaps it was just too easy.&nbsp;But before long he&#8217;d take his winning formula and produce a more enduring tribute song about <a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/12/03/roll-of-the-dice-freehold/\">his own hometown</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>In Michigan<br />\nNever recorded</strong><br />\n<strong>Never released</strong><br />\n<strong>First performed:</strong> September 24, 1996 (Kalamazoo, MI)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> September 26, 1996 (Ann Arbor, MI)</p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
