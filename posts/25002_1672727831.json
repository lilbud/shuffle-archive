(Although I also think there&#8217;s a decent chance Bruce modeled his early &#8217;70s look after that muppet dude.)</p>\n<p>Anyway: let&#8217;s move on to the second version. This next take is clearly a finished song, although it&#8217;s certainly not a releasable mix. The vocals are a bit buried but still easily understandable, and Garry&#8217;s bass is far too prominent (but delightfully so&#8211;he sounds like he&#8217;s having a blast).</p>\n<p>Take a listen and see how many references to other released Springsteen songs you can catch.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Break Out\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vk9MGJkJPoY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>It&#8217;s difficult to analyze &#8220;Break Out,&#8221; since even this take is still a work in progress, but it&#8217;s clear that Bruce is tilling similar soil as &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/05/20/roll-of-the-dice-badlands/\">Badlands</a>&#8221; &#8212; and in fact, I&#8217;m sure you picked out some lyrics that would eventually find their way to that iconic song. So rather than cover that ground again, I&#8217;ll simply annotate when we encounter a lyric that leads elsewhere.</p>\n<p>Here are Bruce&#8217;s lyrics, courtesy of the fine folks at SpringeteenLyrics.com. (I&#8217;m not 100% sure of their accuracy, but they match what I hear closely enough.)</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I was born saved in heaven, and I messed around the promised land</em><br />\n<em>Raised in a good Christian house underneath a good Christian hand</em><br />\n<em>I was schooled down and dirty, signed a note getting back to town</em><br />\n<em>It was there where the workers slaved all week waiting for payday to come around</em></p>\n<p>The official take of &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/07/04/roll-of-the-dice-the-promised-land/\">The Promised Land</a>&#8221; was completed only weeks after the second take of &#8220;Break Out&#8221; above. The phrase must have been on his mind, because it appears twice in this outtake.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll also see some similarities to &#8220;The Promised Land&#8221; in the chorus:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Break out, come on if you&#8217;re coming &#8217;cause baby I just can&#8217;t stay</em><br />\n<em>I want to take out the walls of this joint, I want to blow this town away</em></p>\n<p>In the second verse, however, we hear the seed of a different\u00a0<em>Darkness</em> classic:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Now I ain&#8217;t into fast livin&#8217;, I ain&#8217;t into dying young</em><br />\n<em>And I ain&#8217;t looking to be forgiven for any of the stupid things that I&#8217;ve done</em><br />\n<strong><em>For the ones who once had a notion, a notion it was good to be alive</em></strong><br />\n<em>Feel the spark, the rush of emotion, I want to break out baby tonight</em></p>\n<p>We&#8217;re listening to a track from November 1977. Just a few weeks later, that <strong>bolded</strong> line would appear in a more polished form in &#8220;Badlands.&#8221; (It also appears in a more familiar form a few verses below.)</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I wanna dream, that I got a place</em><br />\n<em>I wanna scream in somebody&#8217;s face</em><br />\n<em>Make it seem, get out of this muddy race</em><br />\n<em>All night long</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well all little queens lose their thrones tonight</em><br />\n<em>All you little pretty things better learn to sleep alone tonight</em></p>\n<p>This one&#8217;s a bit obscure, but if that last couplet sounded familiar, it&#8217;s probably because it reminds you of this passage from &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/03/31/roll-of-the-dice-frankie/\">Frankie</a>&#8221; (even though &#8220;Frankie&#8221; was written first):</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Let all the finer things sleep alone tonight</em><br />\n<em>Let all the minor kings lose their thrones tonight</em></p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s continue:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>It was down in the cool dirty living with the man with the master plan</em><br />\n<em>Some girl who can beg forgiveness and a ticket to the promised land</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Down where they&#8217;ll tear your guts out, making out what you&#8217;re all about</em><br />\n<em>And making while we were blasting like a motor, I want out, I want out, I want out</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Want out to the outside, well I&#8217;m a small and dirty fool</em><br />\n<em>I wanna shout, I&#8217;m bound for nothing, I wanna shout about something too</em><br />\n<em>For the ones who once had a notion, it ain&#8217;t no sin to be glad you&#8217;re alive</em><br />\n<em>I feel the heat, the rush of devotion, I want to tear out baby tonight</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I wanna do what ain&#8217;t ever been done</em><br />\n<em>I wanna win what ain&#8217;t ever been won</em><br />\n<em>I wanna lose what ???</em><br />\n<em>Prove it all night long</em></p>\n<p>Song reference #4: Bruce had already written and recorded early versions of &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/10/24/roll-of-the-dice-prove-it-all-night/\">Prove It All Night</a>&#8221; around the time of that first bluffed version of &#8220;Break Out&#8221; above, so we know that the appearance of that phrase here is almost certainly a loan.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I wanna know that I got a place</em><br />\n<em>I wanna go where I can see your face</em><br />\n<em>I wanna rock the roof off this place</em><br />\n<em>I want you to know I wanna live</em></p>\n<p>I know we&#8217;ve been focusing on the lyrical easter eggs, but &#8220;Break Out&#8221; really does deserve some recognition for its backing track. It&#8217;s a great rocker even in its early versions, and I suspect Bruce did eventually finish the song&#8211;&#8220;Break Out&#8221; was reportedly one of the songs Bruce and team worked on for <em>Tracks</em> two decades later, although it obviously didn&#8217;t make the cut.</p>\n<p>So keep your fingers crossed: &#8220;Break Out&#8221; may yet break out.</p>\n<p><strong>Break Out<br />\nRecorded:</strong> September-November 1977<br />\n<strong>Never released</strong><br />\n<strong>Never performed</strong></p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
