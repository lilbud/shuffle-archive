A ten-month lawsuit over control of Bruce&#8217;s publishing rights ensued, with Bruce legally prohibited from recording in the studio until it was resolved.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, Bruce paid Appel what amounted to a hefty severance fee and won back control of his entire catalog, to date and ongoing.</p>\n<p>His entire catalog, that is, except for a half-dozen songs that Appel wanted to keep for himself.</p>\n<p>&#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/09/24/roll-of-the-dice-thundercrack/\">Thundercrack</a>&#8221; was one of those songs&#8211;an early showstopper that Bruce would release on\u00a0<em>Tracks</em> in 1998. &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/04/10/roll-of-the-dice-song-for-orphans/\">Song for Orphans</a>&#8221; was another; Bruce wouldn&#8217;t release that one until 2020.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Cherokee Queen&#8221; was a third.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Cherokee Queen Bruce Springsteen Band 1972 03 17, Richmond Arena, Richmond, VA\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jGPDXzVkOhQ?start=68&#038;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;Cherokee Queen&#8221; remains unreleased (and presumably unrecorded) to this day. We only know it from surviving bootleg recordings from the Bruce Springsteen Band era, and it&#8217;s likely to stay that way, thanks to some cringeworthy 50-year-old lyrics that land uncomfortably on modern ears.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Ah she&#8217;s a Cherokee queen</em><br />\n<em>Yeah prettiest thing I have ever seen</em><br />\n<em>She&#8217;s an Oklahoma lady</em><br />\n<em>And she drives me crazy</em><br />\n<em>I don&#8217;t know what it is about her</em><br />\n<em>But I just can&#8217;t live without her</em><br />\n<em>She&#8217;s got me in a trance sir</em><br />\n<em>In her heart she&#8217;s a dancer</em><br />\n<em>Like the wind she silently comes</em><br />\n<em>The melody she sweetly hums</em><br />\n<em>She&#8217;s got the words to all my songs</em><br />\n<em>She sang to me all night long</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>She goes, &#8220;Daddy sing me a cradle song</em><br />\n<em>Like you did a long time ago</em><br />\n<em>Daddy sing me a silly song</em><br />\n<em>Won&#8217;t you rock my crazy bones&#8221;</em><br />\n<em>&#8220;Daddy sing me a cradle song</em><br />\n<em>Like you did a long time ago</em><br />\n<em>Daddy sing me a silly song</em><br />\n<em>Won&#8217;t you rock my crazy bones&#8221;</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>She strayed off her reservation</em><br />\n<em>Oh and into my arms</em><br />\n<em>Bringing bad legislation</em><br />\n<em>With her Indian charms</em><br />\n<em>I don&#8217;t know what it is she does sir</em><br />\n<em>That make me wanna love her</em><br />\n<em>It&#8217;s that crazy way of smiling</em><br />\n<em>Oh it just drives the boys wild</em><br />\n<em>Reminds me of one of my high school haunts</em><br />\n<em>She knows what I need and she knows what I want</em><br />\n<em>She&#8217;s got the words to all our songs</em><br />\n<em>And she sang to me all night long</em></p>\n<p>Yeah&#8230; we won&#8217;t unpack these particular lyrics.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s too bad, though, because if not for Bruce&#8217;s insensitive lyrics, &#8220;Cherokee Queen&#8221; could have been one of his earliest contenders for a radio hit. It&#8217;s certainly one of his most ear-friendly and catchy early songs, with David Sancious a particular standout.</p>\n<p>Bruce seems to have belatedly recognized its potential, too: in early 1983, he bought the rights to it back from Appel, and on May 31st he registered it with the U.S. Copyright Office.\u00a0&#8220;Cherokee Queen&#8221; belonged to Bruce again, but to date that copyright remains unutilized.</p>\n<p>Well, mostly unutilized. There actually is a commercially available studio track of &#8220;Cherokee Queen&#8221; available&#8211;it&#8217;s just not Bruce performing it. We&#8217;ll take a listen to it later this month.</p>\n<p><strong>Cherokee Queen<br />\nNever recorded</strong><br />\n<strong>Never released</strong><br />\n<strong>First performed:</strong> July 1971 (South Amboy, NJ)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> October 23, 1971 (Richmond, VA)</p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
