In fact, Bruce&#8217;s very first known performance brought the house down&#8230; or at least the stage.</p>\n<p>Bruce debuted &#8220;Quarter to Three&#8221; as his final encore at New York&#8217;s Avery Fisher Hall on October 4, 1976. It wasn&#8217;t supposed to be the last song, but it ended up that way when the stage collapsed(!) mid-song.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The first two rows of seats next to us just disappeared,&#8221; a fan told Brucebase, and &#8220;the left side of the stage and first couple of rows fell about six feet. A couple of monitors fell in where the people were seated but it didn&#8217;t appear that anyone got hurt. The encore was abruptly ended, however.&#8221;</p>\n<p>You can hear that abrupt ending in the bootleg recording below.</p>\n<div id=\"v-79joqG9f-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='568' src='https://videopress.com/embed/79joqG9f?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>Fast forward to the Born to Run Tour a year later at Hammersmith Odeon (after Bruce and the band had performed the song dozens of times), and &#8220;Quarter to Three&#8221; was honed to a tight, frenetic showpiece, with The Big Man proving a suitable Daddy G stand-in.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen &amp; The E Street Band - Quarter to Three (Live at the Hammersmith Odeon, London &#039;75)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iOYMHP89xrg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Bruce and the E Street Band performed &#8220;Quarter to Three&#8221; more than 75 times in concert before Bruce and Bonds ever met in person. That moment finally came in October 1976, when Bruce caught Bonds&#8217; show at a club called The Hanger on the Jersey shore.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The owner of the club came over to me during the show and mentioned that Bruce Springsteen was in the audience and wanted to come up and play,&#8221; Bonds recalled in an interview. &#8220;Bruce <em>who?</em> I didn&#8217;t recognize the name! But the guys in my band did, so I said OK. When I introduced him the place went crazy\u2026 and I&#8217;m saying to myself, \u2018gee, what on earth is happening here&#8217;?&#8221;</p>\n<p>One of the songs Bruce and Bonds performed that night was the song Bruce used to wake his family with in the middle of the night, and the following week Bruce asked Gary to reciprocate at the E Street Band&#8217;s Palladium show.
