Kelly requested I jump the queue with this one. It&#8217;s a good pick, and a challenging one.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Waiting on the End of the World&#8221; is one of the more obscure entries even among Bruce&#8217;s catalog of unreleased outtakes, and it has a curious history.</p>\n<p>Too new to have been widely bootlegged, &#8220;Waiting on the End of the World&#8221; originated in the limbo period between the &#8220;other band&#8221; era and the acoustic <em>Ghost of Tom Joad</em> era.</p>\n<p>In fact, Bruce recorded it\u00a0<em>twice</em>&#8211;once with the other band (or at least the core members of it) in 1994, and once again during the E Street Band reunion sessions in 1995&#8211;and neither version has ever been officially released.</p>\n<p>The original take with the other band remains securely in the vault, to the best of my knowledge, but the E Street Band version escaped some years ago, and it&#8217;s that version that we can listen to and discuss:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Waiting On The End Of The World\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9VdUYYw6wtA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Musically and vocally, it&#8217;s immediately datable. Even though we&#8217;re listening to the E Street Band, the arrangement, production, and Bruce&#8217;s vocal style are all very reminiscent of the <em>Human Touch/Lucky Town</em> era. That may be why\u00a0 Bruce chose not to release it&#8211;alongside other songs from those sessions (&#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/12/06/roll-of-the-dice-blood-brothers/\">Blood Brothers</a>,&#8221; &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/05/30/roll-of-the-dice-secret-garden/\">Secret Garden</a>,&#8221; &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/11/10/roll-of-the-dice-back-in-your-arms/\">Back in Your Arms</a>.&#8221; for example), it would have been a bit jarring. There may also be another reason, but we&#8217;ll get to that in a bit.</p>\n<p>Still, the ESB took a swing at it in January 1995, when Bruce convened the E Street Band (including Steve Van Zandt) in the studio for the first time in over a decade, to record a few bonus tracks for Bruce&#8217;s planned <em>Greatest Hits</em> album.\u00a0 The song selection was an interesting mix&#8211;in addition to the above songs, there was a cover of &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/08/25/cover-me-high-hopes/\">High Hopes</a>,&#8221; a new take of &#8220;This Hard Land,&#8221; and &#8220;Waiting on the End of the World,&#8221; which was probably still top-of-mind for Bruce, since he had intended it to be the title track of an album he&#8217;d originally hoped to release in 1995, but which Jon Landau discouraged in favor of the <em>Greatest Hits</em> project, and about which Bruce himself had considerable ambivalence after mining similar thematic ground for the past three albums.</p>\n<p>It seems that both recordings of &#8220;Waiting&#8221; were poorly timed, and that&#8217;s too bad&#8211;because it&#8217;s a good song with a great hook and a lot of potential. (The version we&#8217;re fortunate enough to hear is almost certainly unfinished&#8211;a giveaway is how submerged Clarence&#8217;s sax solo is in the mix.)</p>\n<p>Lyrically, &#8220;Waiting on the End of the World&#8221; requires close attention and invites interpretation:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>For one deadly love like a disease</em><br />\n<em>I came to you crawling on my knees</em><br />\n<em>Your eyes filled with rain</em><br />\n<em>I can feel poison running through my veins</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>I&#8217;m waiting,\u00a0I&#8217;m waiting,\u00a0I&#8217;m waiting, waiting on the end of the world</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>For one deadly kiss what would we give</em><br />\n<em>Your skin trembling &#8216;neath my fingertips</em><br />\n<em>All I know is someday</em><br />\n<em>For love, baby, everybody pays</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>I&#8217;m waiting,\u00a0I&#8217;m waiting,\u00a0I&#8217;m waiting, waiting on the end of the world</em></p>\n<p>Bruce repeats the world &#8220;deadly&#8221; in the opening lines of the verses, comparing love and a kiss to disease and death, and ominously predicting that the love he sings about exacts a terrible cost.</p>\n<p>Clearly this is a forbidden love&#8211;an affair perhaps? It&#8217;s certainly possible to read this is as a prequel of sorts to &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/09/07/roll-of-the-dice-hearts-of-stone/\">Hearts of Stone</a>,&#8221; two married-to-others would-be lovers resisting temptation lest they destroy their families and their lives&#8211;the end of their individual worlds.</p>\n<p>But I think that perhaps Bruce meant this song to be more literally interpreted: this love is truly deadly, there really is poison in the narrator&#8217;s veins, and the disease he likens it to is real: AIDS.</p>\n<p>Remember that &#8220;Waiting on the Edge of the World&#8221; was first recorded in 1994&#8211;the same year that Bruce released &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/06/30/roll-of-the-dice-streets-of-philadelphia/\">Streets of Philadelphia</a>.&#8221; The two songs share some very similar imagery, too. Remember those lines above&#8211;&#8220;Your eyes filled with rain/I can feel poison running through my veins&#8221;&#8211;and compare to &#8220;At night I could hear the blood in my veins/Just as black and whispering as the rain.&#8221;</p>\n<p>And the check out the next verse:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>We hide from truth in our hearts</em><br />\n<em>Like one look and everything will fall apart</em><br />\n<em>Here in your arms, soft decay</em><br />\n<em><strong>I can feel myself wasting away</strong></em></p>\n<p>That last line echoes &#8220;Streets of Philadelphia&#8221; as well: &#8220;So brother are you gonna leave me wasting away&#8221;</p>\n<p>Through this lens, that key line in &#8220;Waiting&#8221; becomes even more sinister and layered:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>All I know is someday</em><br />\n<em>For love, baby, everybody pays</em></p>\n<p>The similarities in language and imagery sways me toward believing that &#8220;Waiting on the End of the World&#8221; is an alternate universe &#8220;Streets of Philadelphia,&#8221; and that Bruce chose to release the stronger of the two. The only reason I have any pause is that Bruce continued to work on &#8220;Waiting&#8221; for a full year after &#8220;Streets of Philadelphia&#8221; was released, and it strikes me as a bit odd that Bruce would follow up a song about a lover stricken with AIDS with another song about the same subject so quickly. It certainly wouldn&#8217;t have been the first or last time that Bruce would cross-pollinate his songs, though. To my knowledge Bruce has never discussed this song specifically, so it remains open to debate.</p>\n<p>What do you think?</p>\n<p><strong>Waiting on the End of the World</strong><br />\n<strong>Recorded:</strong> January 1995<br />\n<strong>Never Released</strong><br />\n<strong>Never Performed</strong></p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
