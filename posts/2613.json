It was probably written sometime earlier. And although it seems shocking to us today with the benefit of knowing Bruce&#8217;s full body of work and politics, back in 1982, Bruce came under public fire from the National Organization for Women for his sexist lyrics.</p>\n<p>Specifically, Bruce was called out loudly, publicly, and repeatedly for us frequent use of the term &#8220;little girl&#8221; to refer to the women in his songs.</p>\n<p>Putting this song on\u00a0<em>Born in the U.S.A. </em>might have been like throwing a match in the proverbial powder keg.</p>\n<p>Check out the lyrics:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>I want a little house, on a little hill</em><br />\n<em>I wanna settle down, yeah, I think I will</em><br />\n<em>Settle down and find a little love that&#8217;s true</em><br />\n<em>Settle down with a girl like you</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Seen a lot of girls</em><br />\n<em>Had a lot of fun</em><br />\n<em>Ran around a lot</em><br />\n<em>Now my runnin&#8217;s done</em><br />\n<em>Honey, all I wanna, w</em><em>anna be runnin&#8217; to</em><br />\n<em>Is the arms of a girl like you</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>You start livin&#8217; life</em><br />\n<em>Like you just don&#8217;t care</em><br />\n<em>You done everything</em><br />\n<em>You been everywhere</em><br />\n<em>But what I done ain&#8217;t nothin&#8217; t</em><em>o what I wanna do</em><br />\n<em>When I find a little girl like you</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>We&#8217;ll get married</em><br />\n<em>In a church down a Wynan Bay</em><br />\n<em>Tell a lotta jokes</em><br />\n<em>Have a lotta laughs</em><br />\n<em>Do whatever it is that we wannna do</em><br />\n<em>Long as I do it with a girl like you</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Hey little stranger</em><br />\n<em>Walkin&#8217; down the street</em><br />\n<em>You&#8217;re the only one</em><br />\n<em>You make my life complete</em><br />\n<em>I got a plan but i</em><em>t&#8217;s one made for two</em><br />\n<em>So I need a little girl like you</em><br />\n<em>Yeah, hey, I need a little girl like you</em><br />\n<em>Oh Honey, I need a little girl like you.</em></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not just the repeated &#8220;little girl&#8221; phrasing that&#8217;s problematic&#8211;it&#8217;s the context of a song about a guy who seems more interested in having someone\u00a0<em>like</em> you rather than you in particular. You could argue that it&#8217;s just creative license, and this one I&#8217;d ordinarily grant&#8211;except that it&#8217;s clear in the last verse that he&#8217;s addressing a stranger, and in the earlier verses it&#8217;s clear that he&#8217;s got quite the hookup history and has his mind set on another.</p>\n<p>To a pair of 2018 ears, it&#8217;s a little creepy.</p>\n<p>So, yeah: probably for the best that Bruce discarded this one. He&#8217;s never performed it live, and I doubt he ever will.</p>\n<p><strong>Little Girl (Like You)</strong><br />\n<strong>Recorded:</strong> January 20, 1983<br />\n<strong>Never released</strong><br />\n<strong>Never performed</strong></p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
