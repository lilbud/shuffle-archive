His program focused on (then) modern acts and passed on the Old Guard bands. From that petri dish, John Eddie developed the concept for the <em>Marz, American Style</em> series at Marz Niteclub (formerly Club Paradise, now an empty lot) in Long Branch, New Jersey.</p>\n<p>John\u2019s creative/production team was made up of Bob Benjamin, Henry Vaccaro, Jr. and me (I managed John from 1993-1998). We took Saturday nights with a series of singer/songwriter, regional/national acts that kicked off on Memorial Day weekend. John\u2019s band closed each night.\u00a0 By early July, we had heard that Bruce (a year post-World Tour 1992/1993 and still not reunited with the E Street Band) was tuned in to what we had going on.</p>\n<p>On July 16, Nassar and the Pony celebrated the club\u2019s 20<sup>th</sup> Anniversary by bringing back Southside Johnny and the Jukes, and they had John Eddie open that Summer Stage show.\u00a0 We already had a show booked at Marz that Saturday night&#8211;an acoustic show with Peter Case, Willie Nile and Bruce Tunkel.\u00a0 John and I planned to head there after the Pony.\u00a0Bruce and Jon Bon Jovi joined Southside to end the Pony show.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"I PLAYED THE FOOL (Bruce Springsteen and Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ytSVHBMmYqg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>I spoke to Bruce backstage after and invited him to Marz.\u00a0 \u201cY\u2019all got a lotta great bannnnds playin\u2019 there!\u201d\u00a0 I told him the night\u2019s line-up and suggested he come by sometime.\u00a0 Bruce&#8217;s response: \u201cWe might come by TONIGHT! You got a place to park over there?\u201d (Turns out Bruce, Patti and agent Barry Bell had planned on heading over well before my invite, since Willie was a friend.)</p>\n<p>Jump to later:\u00a0 (1) The Summer Stage Pony crowd was packed inside the Pony expecting Bruce to re-create 1982 as Cats on a Smooth Surface were reuniting, and (2) Bruce was at Marz and elected not to perform there, either.\u00a0 At the end of the night, I handed him a few club t-shirts and he said, \u201cWe had a good time, we\u2019ll be back!\u201d</p>\n<p>Joe Grushecky and the Houserockers played the Marz series on June 25th, and we re-booked Joe for August 20th as well. Joe called Bob and advised that he was going to stay with Bruce for the week and they\u2019d be rehearsing to do our night.</p>\n<p>About 6:00 pm on August 20th, I arrive at Marz.\u00a0 Joe comes over and says, \u201cI got Bruce over here and we\u2019d like to get up and soundcheck.\u201d Our friend and loud sound guy, the late George Iocca, didn\u2019t have mics set up yet. But Joe and Bruce wanted to go so they got going. George was cranky but hey&#8230;</p>\n<p>So, we were expecting Joe Grushecky songs and some traditional covers.\u00a0 Instead, for the ten of us in the house: the rehearsal included &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/05/24/roll-of-the-dice-lucky-town/\">Lucky Town</a>,&#8221; &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/04/10/roll-of-the-dice-darkness-on-the-edge-of-town/\">Darkness on the Edge of Town</a>,&#8221; &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/06/04/roll-of-the-dice-atlantic-city/\">Atlantic City</a>,&#8221; &#8220;Glory Days&#8221; and &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/04/19/matr-john-fogerty-and-bruce-springsteen-born-on-the-bayou/\">Born on the Bayou</a>&#8221; (a Creedence cover).

Scott Kempner fronted the Del-Lords. We had had Scott play Marz earlier in the Summer. And on this night, Scott was playing with Dion Demucci at Club Bene up Route 35 in Sayreville. So we let Scott know of our upcoming night and invited him and Dion.</p>\n<p>The venue fit about 450. We actually probably only had 380, which worked, because Bruce had expressed to me pre-soundcheck that he was always concerned about letting a place get over-crowded, for the safety of the crowd.</p>\n<p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-attachment-id=\"12246\" data-permalink=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/08/20/where-the-band-was-long-branch-august-20-1994/bruce-8-20-94-marz-1-urbish/#main\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Bruce-8-20-94-Marz-1-Urbish.jpg?fit=720%2C621&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"720,621\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Bruce &#8211; 8-20-94 Marz 1 Urbish\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Bruce-8-20-94-Marz-1-Urbish.jpg?fit=300%2C259&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Bruce-8-20-94-Marz-1-Urbish.jpg?fit=720%2C621&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-12246\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Bruce-8-20-94-Marz-1-Urbish-300x259.jpg?resize=758%2C655\" alt=\"\" width=\"758\" height=\"655\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Bruce-8-20-94-Marz-1-Urbish.jpg?resize=300%2C259&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Bruce-8-20-94-Marz-1-Urbish.jpg?w=720&amp;ssl=1 720w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 758px) 100vw, 758px\" /></p>\n<p>There was a moment backstage when Joe was on that I was alone with Bruce.
