The song poses questions for which the answers are intuitively obvious but intellectually impossible to answer, and by doing so Dylan captures the frustration of a society striving to follow their better angels but finding it increasingly difficult to do.</p>\n<p>The song&#8217;s layered, deceptive simplicity makes it instantly memorable, and its message ensures its immortality. That&#8217;s probably why\u00a0<em>Rolling Stone</em> not only includes &#8220;Blowin&#8217; in the Wind&#8221; on its 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list, they rank it near the very top at #14.</p>\n<p>So it&#8217;s surprising to learn that Bruce has only covered Dylan&#8217;s classic twice&#8211;and only one of them was probably his idea.</p>\n<p>But at least Bruce&#8217;s first time covering &#8220;Blowin&#8217; in the Wind&#8217; was a high-visibility occasion: he performed it solo and acoustic at the televised S.O.S. Racisme Concert in Paris in the spring of 1988. Bruce was arguably at a peak of his political involvement at the time (he would very shortly announce is involvement in Amnesty International&#8217;s Human Rights Now Tour), and his performance is powerful and passionate.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen: S.O.S.
