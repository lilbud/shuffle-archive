(See my <a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/10/17/american-babylon-a-retrospective/\">in-depth interview with Joe</a> for more background on their\u00a0<em>American Babylon\u00a0</em>collaboration.)</p>\n<p>Proving themselves adept at collaborating remotely, Bruce and Joe decide to try their hand at it in person, holing up in Bruce&#8217;s home studio and writing in the same room for the first time.</p>\n<p>Having found their groove with\u00a0<em>American Babylon</em>, Joe wrote lyrics for &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/01/11/spare-parts-joe-grushecky-and-the-houserockers-cheap-motel/\">Cheap Motel,</a>&#8221; &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/01/28/rotd-matr-joe-grushecky-and-bruce-springsteen-im-not-sleeping/\">I&#8217;m Not Sleeping</a>,&#8221; and a terrific biting rocker called &#8220;Idiot&#8217;s Delight.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In a similar lyrical vein to &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/06/12/matr-joe-grushecky-and-bruce-springsteen-talking-to-the-king/\">Talking to the King</a>,&#8221; Joe imagines a conversation with Saint Peter, who&#8217;s too busy marveling at humanity&#8217;s stupidity to focus on his duties. (The message is clear: no matter how ideal a situation we&#8217;re handed, never underestimate our collective ability to screw it up.) Bruce set Joe&#8217;s lyrics to music, but unlike their earlier collaborations, they didn&#8217;t record a version of &#8220;Idiot&#8217;s Delight&#8221; together.</p>\n<p>They did, however, record it separately.</p>\n<p>Joe&#8217;s was the first to debut, arranged for The Houserockers on Joe&#8217;s 1998 album,\u00a0<em>Coming Home</em>.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Idiot&#039;s Delight\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xxaiBykzOR4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Bruce&#8217;s version with the E Street Band is still unreleased, but he debuted it without fanfare last summer on his radio show,\u00a0<em>From My Home to Yours</em>.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Idiot&#039;s Delight (RARE song from the vault!)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iOFP6z4qer8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure when Bruce recorded his version of &#8220;Idiot&#8217;s Delight,&#8221; but given its very close similarity to his one and only live performance of it with the E Street Band (with Joe Grushecky on guest vocals) during the Reunion Tour, I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if it dates back to that era.</p>\n<div id=\"v-qWqZaBjm-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='426' src='https://videopress.com/embed/qWqZaBjm?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>There&#8217;s also a third arrangement of &#8220;Idiot&#8217;s Delight&#8221; floating around out there, and it&#8217;s quite a departure from the other two.</p>\n<p>Lucky fans who attended the closing leg of Bruce&#8217;s 2005 solo acoustic tour got a chance to hear a new, sinister arrangement of &#8220;Idiot&#8217;s Delight&#8221; complete with bullet-mic&#8217;ed vocals when Bruce played it an astonishing ten times that October.</p>\n<div id=\"v-XTbqd9DV-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='426' src='https://videopress.com/embed/XTbqd9DV?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>For an under-the-radar song. &#8220;Idiot&#8217;s Delight&#8221; has enjoyed a few different incarnations, all of them great.</p>\n<p>Will we hear it performed live again someday?
