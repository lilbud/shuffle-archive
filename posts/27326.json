Throughout their marathon Born in the U.S.A. Tour in 1984 and 1985, Bruce and the E Street Band wove &#8220;Do You Love Me&#8221; into their encore performances of &#8220;Twist and Shout,&#8221; and audiences responded with a strong affirmative.</p>\n<p>Bruce milked the moment each and every night, teasing his audience while The Big Man egged him on, until he finally catapulted into the song and broke out his finest dance moves.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Do You Love Me - Bruce Springsteen (live at Parc de La Courneuve, Paris 1985)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/W75iwee2ccs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Okay, so maybe he wasn&#8217;t\u00a0<em>Dirty Dancing\u00a0</em>material.
