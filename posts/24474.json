For one thing, it was famously misinterpreted. With an anthemic backing track and a rousing chorus, it&#8217;s easy to overlook the song&#8217;s critical lyrics, which scold America for not being accountable to its ideals.</p>\n<p>In fact, while President Reagan was latching onto Bruce&#8217;s &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/09/21/roll-of-the-dice-born-in-the-u-s-a/\">Born in the U.S.A.</a>&#8221; during his 1984 reelection campaign, he was also playing &#8220;Pink Houses&#8221; at his campaign stops.\u00a0 &#8220;Pink Houses&#8221; has been co-opted by conservative politicians and causes ever since its release; its very liberal author had to ask candidates Reagan, Bush, and McCain to kindly cease and desist.</p>\n<p>Today, &#8220;Pink Houses&#8221; is considered one of Mellencamp&#8217;s greatest songs, and\u00a0<em>Rolling Stone</em> has enshrined it as #447 on its Greatest Songs of All-Time list.</p>\n<p>And yet, even though Bruce and John have shared a stage together a few times over the years, they never teamed up on the most likely candidate from John&#8217;s catalog.</p>\n<p>Not until 2019, at least. At the 1980s-themed\u00a0 benefit concert for The Rainforest Foundation, Bruce and John finally found their moment. During Mellencamp&#8217;s set that evening, he invited a special guest to join him on stage&#8211;and what followed was the first and only team-up to date between Bruce and John on one of their own songs.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"John Mellencamp &amp; Bruce Springsteen - Pink Houses\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RGFyXuTCgDM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>John returned the favor shortly after, which left them tied at one each.
