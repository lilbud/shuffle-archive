Probably because King&#8217;s song is about a young adult&#8217;s last gasp of rebellion. In her lyrics, we hear her determination to stay young at heart, but it&#8217;s tinged with self-knowledge that she&#8217;s only delaying the inevitable.</p>\n<p>In the autumn of 1975, 26-year-old Bruce Springsteen was riding high for the first time.\u00a0<em>Born to Run</em> was a smash hit, and he was finally on the road to stardom. The attention was considerable, and Bruce had begun to rebel against it. For years to come, he&#8217;d resist playing increasingly larger venues and push back against his increasing hype.</p>\n<p>Fame and success came at a cost, and Bruce seemed to intuitively sense he was on the precipice of life changes. And besides, what rock star <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> suffer from Peter Pan syndrome at some point?</p>\n<p>Maybe that&#8217;s why Bruce played &#8220;Goin&#8217; Back&#8221; throughout his stand at The Roxy that October. He debuted it on October 16th with its songwriter in the audience, and he played it five more times in the next three days.</p>\n<p>And then never again.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen &quot;Goin&#039; Back&quot; Live at The Roxy, Oct. 18th, 1975\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bGlXR-H2IuM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Bruce&#8217;s arrangement was gorgeous and his vocals warm, longing, and impassioned. King must have been impressed.</p>\n<p><strong>Bonus:\u00a0</strong>In his introduction to the song, Bruce acknowledged King and tipped his hat to The Byrds&#8217; version (calling them &#8220;my favorite L.A. band, I guess&#8221;).</p>\n<p>But he also acknowledged one other notable cover by 24-year-old Nils Lofgren. Nils had released his version just six months earlier, and only a few weeks after his future bandmates performed it in L.A., Nils would be singing it himself in the U.K.</p>\n<p>Enjoy this rare footage of a very young Nils Lofgren performing Carole King&#8217;s &#8220;Goin&#8217; Back&#8221; on\u00a0<em>The Old Grey Whistle Test\u00a0</em>from November 4, 1975.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Nils Lofgren  - Goin&#039; Back  -  The Old Grey Whistle Test\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rSBeEHUAfok?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><strong>Goin&#8217; Back<br />\nFirst performed:</strong> October 16, 1975 (West Hollywood, CA)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> October 19, 1975 (West Hollywood, CA)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>When Carole King attended Bruce&#8217;s show at The Roxy in 1975, Bruce paid tribute by covering her wistful classic, &#8220;Goin&#8217; Back.&#8221;</p>\n", "protected": false}, "author": 1, "featured_media": 25015, "comment_status": "open", "ping_status": "open", "sticky": false, "template": "", "format": "standard", "meta": {"_monsterinsights_skip_tracking": false, "_monsterinsights_sitenote_active": false, "_monsterinsights_sitenote_note": "", "_monsterinsights_sitenote_category": 0, "jetpack_post_was_ever_published": false, "_jetpack_newsletter_access": "", "_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs": false, "_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id": 0, "_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content": false, "_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content": false, "footnotes": "", "jetpack_publicize_message": "", "jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled": true, "jetpack_social_post_already_shared": true, "jetpack_social_options": {"image_generator_settings": {"template": "highway", "default_image_id": 0, "font": "", "enabled": false}, "version": 2}}, "categories": [4], "tags": [132, 3074, 3075, 194, 2591], "class_list": ["post-24472", "post", "type-post", "status-publish", "format-standard", "has-post-thumbnail", "hentry", "category-cover-me", "tag-carole-king", "tag-dusty-springfield", "tag-goin-back", "tag-nils-lofgren", "tag-the-byrds"], "aioseo_notices": [], "jetpack_publicize_connections": [], "jetpack_featured_media_url": "https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/goin-back.jpg?fit=600%2C600&ssl=1", "jetpack_sharing_enabled": true, "jetpack_shortlink": "https://wp.me/p9w3Lk-6mI", "jetpack_likes_enabled": true, "jetpack-related-posts": [{"id": 29229, "url": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/08/31/cover-me-dessa-im-goin-down/", "url_meta": {"origin": 24472, "position": 0}, "title": "Cover Me, Dessa: I&#8217;m Goin&#8217; Down", "author": "Ken", "date": "August 31, 2021", "format": false, "excerpt": "Indie rapper/singer Dessa dials up the melancholy to eleven in her moody acoustic cover of Bruce's 1985 single.", "rel": "", "context": "In &quot;Cover Me&quot;", "block_context": {"text": "Cover Me", "link": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/category/cover-me/"}, "img": {"alt_text": "", "src": "https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/dessa.jpg?fit=1200%2C675&ssl=1&resize=350%2C200", "width": 350, "height": 200, "srcset": "https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/dessa.jpg?fit=1200%2C675&ssl=1&resize=350%2C200 1x, https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/dessa.jpg?fit=1200%2C675&ssl=1&resize=525%2C300 1.5x, https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/dessa.jpg?fit=1200%2C675&ssl=1&resize=700%2C400 2x, https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/dessa.jpg?fit=1200%2C675&ssl=1&resize=1050%2C600 3x"}, "classes": []}, {"id": 17542, "url": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/05/15/matr-bruce-springsteen-and-jerry-lee-lewis-whole-lotta-shakin-goin-on/", "url_meta": {"origin": 24472, "position": 1}, "title": "MatR: Bruce Springsteen and Jerry Lee Lewis: Whole Lotta Shakin&#8217; Goin&#8217; On", "author": "Ken", "date": "May 15, 2020", "format": false, "excerpt": "Twice in the mid-nineties, Bruce and Jerry Lee Lewis tackled Lewis' first great hit together, and both times they fell short.
