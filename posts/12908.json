It&#8217;s not the drug that&#8217;s the demon&#8211;it&#8217;s the lure, the promise of escape from the life you can&#8217;t face.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s who Harry is.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>So why did Bruce claim &#8220;Harry&#8217;s Place&#8221; was about the Bush administration?</p>\n<p>As near as I can figure, it&#8217;s because he recorded the song during the\u00a0<em>Magic\u00a0</em>sessions, and\u00a0<em>Magic</em> itself was largely a commentary on the Bush years. It&#8217;s an honest mistake (but one that sent a <em>lot</em> of authors and reviewers scampering down the rabbit hole after him, doing their best to analyze the song and contort and force the metaphor).</p>\n<p>But really,\u00a0who can fault him? If I&#8217;d written as many songs as Bruce Springsteen had by that point in his life, I&#8217;m quite certain I would have forgotten the details of a heck of a lot more than just one of them.</p>\n<p>In reality, &#8220;Harry&#8217;s Place&#8221; goes back a lot further than 2007. In fact, we have video of Bruce reciting the lyrics on <em>Nightline</em> in the summer of 2002, tagging it as one of only two recorded outtakes from <em>The Rising</em>&#8211;and those lyrics are identical to the version he would release on <em>High Hopes</em> twelve years later.</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border: none;\" src=\"https://abcnews.go.com/video/embed?id=21544272\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Ted Koppel gets props on three counts here: first for having the nerve to badger Bruce into opening up his notebook; second for prompting him to reveal an unrecorded song; and third, for almost immediately zeroing in on what the song is about.</p>\n<p>Now, yes, I realize that Bruce says &#8220;I was just thinking&#8230; local kingpin stuff, and the rest of the song goes on from there.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But I don&#8217;t buy it&#8211;at least not for the final song. Perhaps it was true at the time of that Koppel interview.</p>\n<p>The lyrics in the video above are at just high enough resolution for us to discern that later verses differ from the <em>High Hopes</em> version, but not enough for us to actually make them out. So I suppose it&#8217;s quite possible that the song did indeed start out as &#8220;local kingpin&#8221; stuff, but I can&#8217;t listen to the entirety of the released song and conclude it&#8217;s about anything other than addiction.</p>\n<p>Bruce also describes &#8220;Harry&#8217;s Place&#8221; as an exercise in recapturing the spirit of his second album, and there are certainly echoes of that writing present (for example, the return of colorfully named characters like Seesaw Bobby). But &#8220;Harry&#8217;s Place&#8221; has more in common with &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/02/20/roll-of-the-dice-lost-in-the-flood/\">Lost in the Flood</a>&#8221; from his first album than anything on his second.</p>\n<p>So how do we make sense of all this? As near as I can tell, this is the story:</p>\n<p>Sometime in 2001&#8211;probably prior to 9/11&#8211;Bruce came up with &#8220;Harry&#8217;s Place&#8221; during a style exercise.</p>\n<p>When it came time to write and record <em>The Rising</em>, the lyrics were still hanging around his empty notebook. He recorded it (Bruce said an interview that &#8220;it initially started out as just me on the piano&#8221;) but didn&#8217;t feel strongly enough about it to include it. So he shelved it, but continued to work on the song after <em>The Rising\u00a0</em>was released, polishing it into its final, pointed lyrical form.</p>\n<p>Then came the Bush years, and a spate of songs that would become <em>Magic,\u00a0</em>and although Bruce recorded &#8220;Harry&#8217;s Place&#8221; with the band during those sessions (which explains Clarence&#8217;s wonderfully sinister sax solo), it ultimately didn&#8217;t fit the theme of that album either.</p>\n<p>(For what it&#8217;s worth, Bruce suggested as much during a <em>Rolling Stone</em> interview, after the interviewer gently corrected him for the quote that opens this essay.)</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&#8220;Oh, so if I had those in my book, maybe that must have been for The Rising. I had those lyrics at that time. It\u2019s not uncommon for lyrics to sit in a notebook for a very long time sometimes. I might not know what to do with them, and then suddenly it\u2019s there. So that song was a classic one that had a long gestation. I think, lyrically, I had it way back then. Musically, it\u2019s from somewhere in the mid-zeros, and then we recorded a lot of things freshly on it recently. It\u2019s not an uncommon progression for some of my music.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>So into the vault it went again, until Bruce returned to it during the\u00a0<em>High Hopes\u00a0</em>sessions, taking the\u00a0<em>Magic-</em>era outtake recorded with Brendan O&#8217;Brien, overlaying a violent new guitar contribution from Tom Morello, and massaging it into final form with Ron Aniello.</p>\n<p>Only by this time, Bruce had completely forgotten what he&#8217;d written about in the first place&#8211;which isn&#8217;t surprising, given that his volunteered information seems to be more in response to interviewer prodding than genuine recollection.</p>\n<p>Since Bruce has never performed &#8220;Harry&#8217;s Place&#8221; in concert, we don&#8217;t have any on-stage commentary\u00a0 to shed additional light on it. So we&#8217;re forced to decide for ourselves what Bruce was really writing about in &#8220;Harry&#8217;s Place.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve shared my own take with you here, but ultimately your guess is as good as mine.</p>\n<p>And apparently as good as Bruce&#8217;s.</p>\n<p><strong>Harry&#8217;s Place</strong><br />\n<strong>Recorded:</strong> 2007 and 2014<br />\n<strong>Released:\u00a0</strong><em>High Hopes</em> (2014)<br />\n<strong>Never performed</strong></p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
