In fact, he used a boom box situated so that it would capture the band&#8217;s full sound.</p>\n<p>None of the singers (including Bruce himself) were miked, which means that any vocals were almost always inaudible in the recordings. Combined with Bruce&#8217;s penchant for bluffing lyrics during these sessions, trying to decipher what he&#8217;s singing in these tapes is a futile exercise.</p>\n<p>Occasionally, though, one of the band members would stand close enough to the boom box to be clearly picked up, and that&#8217;s hilariously the case with today&#8217;s entry. See if you can guess who it was:</p>\n<div id=\"v-Sn7CZSA8-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='568' src='https://videopress.com/embed/Sn7CZSA8?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>We likely wouldn&#8217;t even know the title of this abandoned song had The Big Man not been standing so close to the recorder, but we can&#8217;t possibly miss him or his shouted &#8220;I Don&#8217;t Wanna Be!&#8221; vocals.</p>\n<p>As far as we know, &#8220;I Don&#8217;t Wanna Be&#8221; never developed into a full song.
