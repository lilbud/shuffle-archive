No idea&#8211;especially when some of their best gigs were in the dead of winter.</p>\n<p>But something about the band&#8217;s proto-E Street, bluesy grooves begs to be played outdoors on a warm and sunny day. Which is sort of the way the band played this particular song to begin with: at an outdoor festival at Newark State College on May 15, 1971.</p>\n<p>While the group included all the core BSB players, technically they were still a few weeks shy of calling themselves by that name. For one memorable pre-Memorial Day weekend, Bruce and the boys performed under the name Dr. Zoom &amp; The Sonic Boom, with a set that veered a little more toward the recently defunct Steel Mill sound while verging ever more into the blues.</p>\n<p>The set list that day included Bruce&#8217;s only known performance of an original song called &#8220;Last Night in Texas.&#8221; It may be a bit generous to call it an original song, however,\u00a0 because Bruce built it on the chassis of a Sonny Boy Williamson blues single from 1963 called &#8220;One Way Out.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"SONNY BOY WILLIAMSON W/ BUDDY GUY - ONE WAY OUT - 1963\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/x2An9nyzMW4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;One Way Out&#8221; was a comic blues tale, the dilemma of a cheating lover trying desperately to escape out the bedroom window before getting caught.\u00a0Bruce lifted the music from &#8220;One Way Out&#8221; but completely rewrote the lyrics, turning it into an itinerant musician&#8217;s travelogue as he prepares to move on to the next town.</p>\n<div id=\"v-rXhuhsZF-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='568' src='https://videopress.com/embed/rXhuhsZF?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>The fifty-plus-year-old soundboard recording above is astoundingly clear, allowing us to fully appreciate the technical proficiency of the players&#8211;particularly some scorching Springsteen guitar solos (starting around the 2:30 mark) competing against David Sancious&#8217; organ solos (starting at the four-minute mark), and an all-out jam (featuring Southside Johnny on harmonica) that breaks out a minute later.</p>\n<p>As for the lyrics&#8230; well, like much of the Steel Mill and early Bruce Springsteen Band material, they&#8217;re sort of beside the point. They&#8217;re also a bit hard to decipher, but the fine folks at Springsteenlyrics.com gave it a shot and managed to get most of them. Several lines are still tough to hear, but like &#8220;One Way Out,&#8221; there&#8217;s not meant to be much substance here. &#8220;Last Night in Texas&#8221; is much more of a traditional blues (albeit in a rock arrangement) than Williamson&#8217;s original.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I said it&#8217;s the last night in Texas</em><br />\n<em>Movin&#8217; down to San Antone</em><br />\n<em>It&#8217;s my last night in Texas</em><br />\n<em>Then I&#8217;m out of San Antone</em><br />\n<em>???</em><br />\n<em>Going to leave old Texas and me alone</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well in South Dakota</em><br />\n<em>Well I met ???</em><br />\n<em>South Dakota yeah yeah</em><br />\n<em>???</em><br />\n<em>???</em><br />\n<em>Spend the nights just ???</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well I&#8217;m moving on the westbound</em><br />\n<em>Moving on the westbound train</em><br />\n<em>Said I&#8217;m moving on the westbound</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;m on the westbound train</em><br />\n<em>Once I get out of this town</em><br />\n<em>Gonna never come back to Texas again</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Last night in Texas and I&#8217;m on to San Antoine</em><br />\n<em>Got no woman to treat me, no woman to call my own</em><br />\n<em>???</em><br />\n<em>God knows she won&#8217;t leave it alone</em></p>\n<p>&#8220;Last Night in Texas&#8221; was hardly Bruce&#8217;s best or most original work (even for the time period) but it&#8217;s a fun rarity that was only captured on tape once.</p>\n<p>Summer&#8217;s only just beginning, though, and we&#8217;ll have some stronger Bruce Springsteen Band songs to check out soon.</p>\n<p><strong>Last Night in Texas<br />\nNever recorded</strong><br />\n<strong>Never released</strong><br />\n<strong>First performed:</strong> May 15, 1971 (Union, NJ)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> May 15, 1971 (Union, NJ)</p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
