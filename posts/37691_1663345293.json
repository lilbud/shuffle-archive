I guess we\u2019ve ended up somewhere in the middle of the two live versions Springsteen does with a bit of U2 influenced guitar thrown in! Maybe not too bad a place to be.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Why another Bruce cover so soon after the first?</p>\n<p>&#8220;Each year we offer our followers a chance to sponsor a song,&#8221; explained Pattison. &#8220;Johan, one of our followers from Denmark, asked us to consider this song and we were delighted to as it is one of our favourite songs. It speaks to hope in the struggle. Everyone can relate to it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Scott also hinted that we should keep an eye out for at least one more Springsteen cover in the near future, so we may not have seen the last of them here on the blog. Until then, enjoy their latest track and head over to <a href=\"https://www.decemberband.com/\">their site</a> to check out more of their original music and covers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>Glasgow-based December is back with a terrific cover of Bruce Springsteen&#8217;s classic Nebraska-era track.</p>\n", "protected": false}, "author": 1, "featured_media": 37762, "comment_status": "open", "ping_status": "open", "sticky": false, "template": "", "format": "standard", "meta": {"_monsterinsights_skip_tracking": false, "_monsterinsights_sitenote_active": false, "_monsterinsights_sitenote_note": "", "_monsterinsights_sitenote_category": 0, "jetpack_post_was_ever_published": false, "_jetpack_newsletter_access": "", "_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs": false, "_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id": 0, "_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content": false, "_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content": false, "footnotes": "", "jetpack_publicize_message": "", "jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled": true, "jetpack_social_post_already_shared": true, "jetpack_social_options": {"image_generator_settings": {"template": "highway", "default_image_id": 0, "font": "", "enabled": false}, "version": 2}}, "categories": [4], "tags": [3429, 3528], "class_list": ["post-37691", "post", "type-post", "status-publish", "format-standard", "has-post-thumbnail", "hentry", "category-cover-me", "tag-december", "tag-reason-to-bellieve"], "aioseo_notices": [], "jetpack_publicize_connections": [], "jetpack_featured_media_url": "https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/december.jpg?fit=1472%2C1440&ssl=1", "jetpack_sharing_enabled": true, "jetpack_shortlink": "https://wp.me/p9w3Lk-9NV", "jetpack_likes_enabled": true, "jetpack-related-posts": [{"id": 33101, "url": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/03/05/cover-me-december-no-surrender/", "url_meta": {"origin": 37691, "position": 0}, "title": "Cover Me, December: No Surrender", "author": "Ken", "date": "March 5, 2022", "format": false, "excerpt": "This powerful new cover from Glasgow-based December couldn't be more timely.
