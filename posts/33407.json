And only someone lucky enough to have found the right person to spend those days with.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s the linchpin of\u00a0<em>Working on a Dream,\u00a0</em>Bruce Springsteen&#8217;s first album to embrace the theme of aging, released in the waning days of his sixth decade on the planet. In years to come, he&#8217;d write plenty of songs that deal with the loss that comes with aging. &#8220;Kingdom of Days&#8221; stands out as one of his only songs that focuses on time&#8217;s gifts.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also one of Bruce&#8217;s very best love songs, focusing on the rewards of love rather than (only) its rush. Most reviews I&#8217;ve read label &#8220;Kingdom of Days&#8221; as an ode to life-long love, obviously informed by Bruce&#8217;s marriage to Patti Scialfa. The songwriter himself called it &#8220;something you write after having a long, long life with somebody&#8221; in a <em>Rolling Stone\u00a0</em>interview in 2009.</p>\n<p>But it really isn&#8217;t. To appreciate &#8220;Kingdom of Days&#8221; does not require one to have a decades-long romantic foundation&#8211;in fact, there&#8217;s not a single reference to a single yesterday in the entire song.</p>\n<p>This is a song about the importance of <em>today;</em> it only requires that you&#8217;re with your person <em>now</em>.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>With you I don&#8217;t hear the minutes ticking by</em><br />\n<em>I don&#8217;t feel the hours as they fly</em><br />\n<em>I don&#8217;t see the summer as it wanes</em><br />\n<em>Just a subtle change of light upon your face</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Walk away, walk away, walk away, walk away</em><br />\n<em>This is our kingdom of days</em></p>\n<p>The first couplet captures the time-altering early days of love&#8211;how we lose track of the world as our foreground focus locks completely onto our new favorite.</p>\n<p>It also describes the experience of our later years with that person by our side. It&#8217;s a known phenomenon that our sense of time accelerates as we age; it&#8217;s why time seems to fly faster with each passing year. But when we spend those autumn years (and yes, Bruce sets his song in autumn deliberately&#8211;an on-the-nose facet of an otherwise subtle song) with our true love, time slows down. We notice more, regret less, and take deep satisfaction in the <em>today</em> before us.</p>\n<p>If time takes its toll around us, we notice it only in the gentle, gradual changes in our partner, whose beauty never wavers. As Bruce told Hagen, &#8220;[&#8216;Kingdom of Days&#8217;] also deals with the deterioration of your physical body. It drifts away&#8230; but beauty remains. It&#8217;s about two people and you visit that place in each other&#8217;s face.&#8221;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I watch the sun as it rises and sets</em><br />\n<em>I watch the moon trace its arc with no regrets</em><br />\n<em>My jacket &#8217;round your shoulders, the falling leaves</em><br />\n<em>The wet grass on our backs as the autumn breeze drifts through the trees</em></p>\n<p>On first listen, it might seem like the two verses of &#8220;Kingdom of Days&#8221; contradict each other: in the first verse, our narrator is oblivious to time passing; in the second, he traces the course of the day. So which is it?</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s no contradiction. Our narrator is is oblivious to time passing him by because he&#8217;s living in an ever-present today.\u00a0<em>I watch the moon trace its arc with no regrets.\u00a0</em>We should all be so lucky to need nothing of tomorrow because we have all we need to be happy right now.</p>\n<p>All the while, Bruce sings some of his warmest vocals on record against a lushly orchestrated backing track that wouldn&#8217;t sound out of place on <em>Western Stars</em>. As the song arches toward its bridge, our lovers come together, subtly informing us that it&#8217;s not just love but also passion that proves immune to time.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I do</em><br />\n<em>You whisper &#8220;then prove it, then prove it, then prove it to me baby blue&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>Love and passion inoculate us against time&#8217;s terror and thievery. Our bodies may decay, our minds may slow. But when we see how ineffective time is on the beauty of our partner&#8217;s face, we don&#8217;t fear its impact on our own.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>And I count my blessings that you&#8217;re mine for always</em><br />\n<em>We laugh beneath the covers</em><br />\n<em>and count the wrinkles and the grays</em></p>\n<p>We laugh at and celebrate each new wrinkle and rob time of its power to frighten. That place we visit in each other&#8217;s face, Bruce tells us, is &#8220;not just the past and today&#8230; you visit the tomorrows in the person&#8217;s face now.&#8221; And those tomorrows seem pretty darn inviting.</p>\n<p>If there&#8217;s a moral to &#8220;Kingdom of Days&#8221; it&#8217;s that it matters who you spend your days with. Life is short, but it&#8217;s also long. Our lives are a kingdom of days, and heavy is the head that wears the crown. It helps to have someone to share it with.</p>\n<p>With the right person beside us, a kingdom can become a garden, with each day bearing fruit sweeter than the day before.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Sing away, sing away, sing away, sing away</em><br />\n<em>Sing away, sing away, my darling, we&#8217;ll sing away</em><br />\n<em>This is our kingdom of days</em></p>\n<p>In the end, we have nothing but time. Spend it wisely, with the right person.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>&#8220;Kingdom of Days&#8221; was a nightly staple during the early months of the Working on a Dream Tour, one of the rare album tracks to survive past the opening few weeks.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen &amp; ESB - Kingdom Of Days (live)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tD4ecB9IMgQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>By the summer, though, it had disappeared from the set list, never to return.</p>\n<p>Never, that is, except for a pair of acoustic performances in the spring of 2014.
