Springsteen shows typically lean toward a theme or a vibe: sometimes you get serious Bruce, sometimes silly Bruce. Some set lists are rigid, others loose. Sometimes there&#8217;s a message, sometimes he&#8217;s only there for fun. But this show seemed like a grab bag&#8211;a collection of moments and mini-sets rather than a cohesive whole. That might sound like a less-than-satisfactory experience, but as a capstone for a year of great shows, it was actually a pretty nice way to go out.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen &amp;
