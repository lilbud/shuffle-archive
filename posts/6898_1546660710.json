That&#8217;s been my absolute favorite part of the last year, and as a result I definitely feel like I&#8217;ve learned at least as much as I&#8217;ve shared. I&#8217;ve also made a lot of great new friends through the social media channels I share my blog posts in, and you all have made this a labor of love in now multiples senses.</p>\n<p>When I started this blog, I didn&#8217;t set out to keep a daily schedule&#8211;I just kind of fell into it, and once I realized it, I challenged myself to keep it up. Today marks 365 consecutive days of new content, and this post makes the grand total for the year a whopping 795 posts. I don&#8217;t foresee breaking that streak any time soon.</p>\n<p>Today also marks the end of the year-long &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/category/kingdom-of-days/\">Kingdom of Days</a>&#8221; series&#8211;but tomorrow marks a new beginning!</p>\n<p>Starting tomorrow, I&#8217;ll be reblogging the daily &#8220;Kingdom of Days&#8221; entries, and the vast majority of them should feature minor to significant updates. Since the posts are now all written, that frees up about 50% of my blogging time to focus on more uploads of rare video, obscure shows, and more. This past year, I tended to upload a track or two to spotlight; this year, I&#8217;ll try to upload entire shows as often as I can.</p>\n<p>(This is probably as good a time as any to recommend checking out <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsJqIOT5dS3zfPk31U8o8_A?view_as=subscriber\">our companion youtube channel</a>. It features the hundreds of videos I&#8217;ve uploaded this past year, and I add new content almost daily. Everything there appears simultaneously on this blog as well, so it&#8217;s purely personal preference as to whether you find it worth subscribing to either/both.)</p>\n<p>In addition, I&#8217;ll continue to spotlight an <a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/category/roll-of-the-dice/\">original Springsteen song</a>, <a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/category/cover-me/\">cover</a>, or <a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/category/meeting-across-the-river/\">team-up</a> each day, and I&#8217;ll be introducing at least one new post series as well in the near future, spotlighting some of my favorite Bruce-related resources, blogs, podcasts, etc. I just did a quick tally of articles left to write based on the above&#8230; and it&#8217;s more than 1,100. Looks like we&#8217;re just getting started.</p>\n<p>Thanks again for reading. I hope you stick around for Year Two!</p>\n<p>Ken</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>We&#8217;re one year old!
