It was his theme song, one which everyone relates to his Las Vegas period: &#8216;I Can&#8217;t Help Falling in Love With You.&#8217; Which I think is a great song, but everyone relates to it as being Las Vegas-y, but I don&#8217;t think it is.

Hayes, who actually wasn&#8217;t an actress but rather a congresswoman (fun fact #1)) with a music box that plays a &#8220;European love song.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Of course, the European love song turns out to sound an awful lot like a pop hit in the making.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Elvis Presley - Can&#039;t Help Falling in Love (From &quot;Blue Hawaii&quot;)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ipJtTQkYZZk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Fun fact #2: Elvis was actually right. That\u00a0<em>was\u00a0</em>a European love song.</p>\n<p>Well, sort of. The lyrics are kind of a downer, but that music box was playing an 18th-century composition by Jean Paul-Egide Martini\u00a0 called &#8220;Plaisir d&#8217;Amour&#8221; (Pleasing Love), adapted from the novel <em>Celestine\u00a0</em>by Jean-Pierre Claris de Florian.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Jean Paul \u00c9gide Martini - Plaisir d&#039;amour (1784 ca.)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zqAxVrBwoqg?start=100&#038;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>The chorus of &#8220;Plaisir d&#8217;Amour&#8221; translates to&#8230;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Pleasure of love only lasts a moment</em><br />\n<em>Heartache lasts a lifetime</em></p>\n<p>&#8230;with verses like:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><i>I gave up everything for the ungrateful Sylvia<br />\nShe left me for another lover</i></p>\n<p>So calling it a &#8220;European love song&#8221; might have been a bit of a stretch.</p>\n<p>But there&#8217;s no doubt about the song that Elvis sang. Written by Hugo Peretti, Luigi Creatore, and George David Weiss, &#8220;Can&#8217;t Help Falling in Love&#8221; is as romantic a ballad as they come. (Fun fact #3: it was originally written for a woman to sing, which is why there&#8217;s that odd non-rhyme (&#8220;would it be a sin&#8221;)&#8211;it was meant to rhyme with &#8220;I can&#8217;t help falling in love with <em>him</em>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Elvis released the song as a single and it became a smash hit, reaching #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 and inspiring a carafe of covers in across just about every genre, from disco&#8230;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"The Stylistics I Can&#039;t Help Falling In Love\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jpvN86IN9aA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8230;to synth-pop&#8230;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Erasure - Can&#039;t Help Falling In Love\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WMT6QHDP_Nw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8230;to reggae, in a version by UB40 that went all the way to #1 in 1993.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"UB40 CAN&#039;T HELP FALLING IN LOVE\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ajp0Uaw4rqo?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>As for The King himself, &#8220;Can&#8217;t Help Falling in Love&#8221; made frequent appearances in his sets, often serving as his final number. (It was, in fact, the very last song he ever performed live.)</p>\n<p>Over time, though, the song evolved far from its original arrangement, which explains Bruce&#8217;s &#8220;Las Vegas-y&#8221; remark in the pullquote at the top.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Elvis Presley -  Can&#039;t Help Falling In Love \u2022 Live in Las Vegas 1970\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xdLlk7NYGAA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>So when Bruce finally covered &#8220;Can&#8217;t Help Falling in Love&#8221; almost three years after he almost debuted it in Washington, DC, he went back to the original arrangement for inspiration.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Can&#039;t Help Falling In Love (Live at Wembley Arena, London, UK - 06/05/81 - Official Audio)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lGtG8qLH2B4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Bruce&#8217;s reading of &#8220;Can&#8217;t Help Falling in Love&#8221; is every bit as warm, tender, and sincere as Elvis&#8217; original, and it benefits greatly from his solo acoustic arrangement.</p>\n<p>Four years later, Bruce made it an encore staple on the Born in the U.S.A.

back only three times in the more than three decades since.</p>\n<p>But when a fan requested it on the Working on a Dream Tour, Bruce and the band reclaimed it with a full-band arrangement that restored the romantic grandeur of the original while still allowing Bruce an opportunity for an impressively lush vocal.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\"
