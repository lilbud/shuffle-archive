There&#8217;s an intermission in sight, but we&#8217;ve got to get through three more songs to get there.</p>\n<p>And nature is calling.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve all been there, right? Most of the time, we grit our teeth, clench our bladder and soldier through.</p>\n<p>But sometimes&#8230; we just can&#8217;t.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s what happened to Bruce Springsteen on December 8, 1992, when he just couldn&#8217;t hold it anymore. After finishing a rousing rendition of &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/03/18/roll-of-the-dice-living-proof/\">Living Proof</a>&#8221; (dancing a little more stiffly than usual), he sidled over to the microphone, excused himself, and made a mad dash backstage to micturate.</p>\n<p>While he was gone, Roy Bittan vamped with some New Orleans-style honky-tonk.</p>\n<div id=\"v-5QY6ZeFJ-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='426' src='https://videopress.com/embed/5QY6ZeFJ?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>When he returned to the stage (with an audible sigh of relief), a much happier Springsteen improvised some lyrics on the spot:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I&#8217;m gonna rock all night long, I&#8217;m gonna rock</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;m gonna rock all night long, I&#8217;m gonna rock</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;m gonna rock all night long, I&#8217;m gonna rock, baby &#8217;til it comes the dawn</em></p>\n<p>Not the deepest lyrics in his songbook, but they did the trick and kept the crowd&#8217;s energy level up until he was ready to resume the set with &#8220;Leap of Faith.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As far as I know, those lyrics have never appeared anywhere else in his catalog, making &#8220;I&#8217;m Gonna Rock (The Pee Pee Song)&#8221; a bona fide original Springsteen song.</p>\n<p>He hasn&#8217;t performed it since, but I bet he&#8217;s glad he hasn&#8217;t had to.</p>\n<p><strong>I&#8217;m Gonna Rock (The Pee Pee Song)<br />\nNever recorded</strong><br />\n<strong>Never released</strong><br />\n<strong>First performed:</strong> December 8, 1992 (Philadelphia, PA)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> December 8, 1992 (Philadelphia, PA)</p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
