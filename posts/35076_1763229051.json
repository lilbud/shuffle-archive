For another&#8230; well, listen and hear for yourself.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Party Lights\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NiZDFE_7NkM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>See what I mean? &#8220;Party Lights&#8221; is an uptempo pop song completely devoid of electric guitar, making it an odd choice for a budding rock star&#8217;s set list.</p>\n<p>But if we&#8217;re willing to overlook the absent guitar, the rest of the arrangement seems tailor-made for the E Street Band, right down to the sax solo. It certainly was a hit, too&#8211;Philadelphia-based Claudine Clark earned her one-hit wonder status when she took &#8220;Party Lights&#8221; all the way to #5 on the Billboard Top 100 in 1962 and landing at #35 for the year.</p>\n<p>Regardless of whatever lodged it in Bruce&#8217;s brain back in 1975, &#8220;Party Lights&#8221; was a perfect fit for the romantic, retro stylings of the Born to Run Tour. It made three brief appearances during early December, the first of which remains the best recording.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - PARTY LIGHTS 1975  (audio)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_CqYpjOqG80?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Bruce kept the arrangement faithful, right down to the Spectorian &#8220;whoa oh oh oh&#8217;s.&#8221; But after three performances in ten days, Bruce retired &#8220;Party Lights&#8221; and hasn&#8217;t played it since.</p>\n<p>He didn&#8217;t forget about it, though. Four years later, Bruce recorded a track for\u00a0<em>The River</em> that while destined for outtake status managed to contribute some\u00a0<em>very</em> familiar lyrics to the Springsteen catalog.</p>\n<p>While the music and the arrangement might have been very different, when the track was finally released officially in\u00a0<em>The Ties That Bind: The River Collection</em>, we could hear for ourselves just how much of an impression Claudine Clark&#8217;s only hit single made on Bruce.</p>\n<p>In fact, Bruce&#8217;s song sounds very much like a direct sequel. Clark&#8217;s original centered around a girl with some serious FOMO; Bruce&#8217;s more mature track revisits the same character long after those party lights have faded.</p>\n<p>Take a listen to Bruce&#8217;s own version of &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/11/14/roll-of-the-dice-party-lights/\">Party Lights</a>&#8221; and hear for yourself.</p>\n<div
