This songwriting period coincided with a new phase in his life as a family man; Bruce obviously saw this as a new life chapter, and that notion expressed itself in his writing.</p>\n<p>Bruce wrote &#8220;Over the Rise&#8221; on the bass, one of a handful of songs he composed that way in late 1990, of which only &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/05/17/roll-of-the-dice-57-channels-and-nothin-on/\">57 Channels (and Nothin&#8217; On)</a>&#8221; would make it to his next records. The bass riff (if we can call it that&#8211;it&#8217;s more percussive than melodic) propels us forward even while Bruce&#8217;s lyrics tell of being left behind.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s take a listen.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Over The Rise (Studio Outtake - 1990)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SzmJ_HPqE9Q?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>When Bruce wrote &#8220;Over the Rise&#8221; he was a second-time newlywed, determined to not screw it up this time. His lyrics read more like a post-mortem for his first marriage than an omen for his second, because this is one very, very dark song.</p>\n<p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-attachment-id=\"19679\" data-permalink=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/07/12/roll-of-the-dice-over-the-rise/overtherise_lyrics-sheet/#main\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/overtherise_lyrics-sheet.jpg?fit=615%2C800&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"615,800\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"overtherise_lyrics-sheet\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/overtherise_lyrics-sheet.jpg?fit=231%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/overtherise_lyrics-sheet.jpg?fit=615%2C800&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-19679\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/overtherise_lyrics-sheet-231x300.jpg?resize=758%2C985\" alt=\"\" width=\"758\" height=\"985\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/overtherise_lyrics-sheet.jpg?resize=231%2C300&amp;ssl=1 231w, https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/overtherise_lyrics-sheet.jpg?w=615&amp;ssl=1 615w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 758px) 100vw, 758px\" /></p>\n<p>Almost immediately, we meet a gypsy. Is this the same gypsy from &#8220;Brilliant Disguise?&#8221; Very possibly&#8211;we may even be hearing from the same narrator.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I walk along the levee to see the gypsy man</em><br />\n<em>The dirt &#8216;neath my feet, baby, is turnin&#8217; to quicksand</em><br />\n<em>He looked into my palm, then looked me in the eye</em><br />\n<em>Told me you were gone, gone over the rise</em></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not a stretch to assume that &#8220;Over the Rise&#8221; may take place just a short distance into the future from &#8220;Brilliant Disguise,&#8221; suspicion having turned into separation.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Once we stood together at the wishing well</em><br />\n<em>Our wishes like dreams, baby, into the water fell</em><br />\n<em>Oh then I kissed your lips, but when I looked into your eyes</em><br />\n<em>They were gone, gone over the rise</em></p>\n<p>We hear callbacks to &#8220;If I Should Fall Behind&#8221; next (although Bruce recorded that classic after he recorded &#8220;Over the Rise,&#8221; he actually wrote it earlier for his wedding the previous summer), with Bruce using similar imagery of two life travelers by the river&#8217;s edge.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Tonight the blackbirds fly low on the water&#8217;s edge</em><br />\n<em>Oh we walked this path not knowing where it led</em><br />\n<em>Now at the bottom of the river deep lies something shiny and golden</em><br />\n<em>Is a promise that love couldn&#8217;t keep same as a promise broken</em></p>\n<p>Those last two lines are devastatingly sad: first, we get the song&#8217;s big reveal: unlike &#8220;Brilliant Disguise,&#8221; in which the lovers are drifting apart, here we see a wedding ring at the bottom of a river. Lest we miss the loaded symbolism of that river, we also get an extremely direct reference to one of Bruce&#8217;s most poignant songs in the final line.</p>\n<p>Can a vow be considered broken if their love was never strong enough to keep it in the first place? Might as well ask whether a dream is a lie if it don&#8217;t come true, because it&#8217;s basically the same question.</p>\n<p>We end &#8220;Over the Rise&#8221; on one of the saddest notes in Bruce&#8217;s catalog: alone in the dark, in the rain, without even the tears of our lost love to remind us of what we miss.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well I woke last night to the sound of rain</em><br />\n<em>The wind rustling branches against the window pane</em><br />\n<em>I searched the pillow beside me for the tears we cried</em><br />\n<em>Baby they were gone, gone over the rise</em></p>\n<p>Placed in the perspective of his catalog, &#8220;Over the Rise&#8221; is a strange song&#8211;it echoes so many of Bruce&#8217;s previous songs without actually saying anything new, yet the very recurrence of some of his most prevalent themes and metaphors suggests that it&#8217;s one of his more personally revealing songs.</p>\n<p>Bruce has never performed &#8220;Over the Rise&#8221; in public.
