Wikipedia attributes it to the white composer Harry Dixon Loes, but researchers have cast doubt on that.</p>\n<p>What <em>is</em> clear is the role the song plays in American culture. It&#8217;s one of the most enduring folk and gospel songs that children learn in school, church, even on TV.</p>\n<p>It endures for a reason: we have it at the ready when the world challenges us to maintain our faith and resolve&#8211;most often when our rights or the rights of our fellow citizens are at risk, as was the case of perhaps the most famous version of the song, by Bettie Mae Fikes.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"This Little Light of Mine\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5FgBb3u8p9U?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;This Little Light of Mine&#8221; is a song of defiance, steadfastness, and unity&#8211;a perfect candidate for adoption by the Civil Rights Movement, particularly after Pete Seeger popularized the version taught to him by Zilphia Horton in the 1960s.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"This Little Light of Mine\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FrXUucm-Clk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;This Little Light of Mine&#8221; has been a part of protest culture ever since, as recently and famously as the tragic events of the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville in 2017, where protesters used the song to drown out white nationalists.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Charlottesville : This Little Light Of Mine 4K\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lyN2LeDlXzE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>So it was a perfect candidate for inclusion on Bruce Springsteen&#8217;s Seeger Sessions Tour, too, although Bruce didn&#8217;t introduce it until the tour&#8217;s final leg.</p>\n<p>Prior to the final European leg of the tour, Bruce had been closing most of his shows with &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/03/28/cover-me-when-the-saints-go-marching-in/\">When the Saints Go Marching In</a>.&#8221; Over the summer, however, Bruce had debuted and released a new song, &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/01/10/roll-of-the-dice-american-land/\">American Land,</a>&#8221; which in the autumn became the new show closer, ending each night on an appropriately upbeat and fiery note.</p>\n<p>However, Bruce realized he needed a segue between the quiet &#8220;Saints&#8221; and the defiant &#8220;American Land,&#8221; and &#8220;This Little Light of Mine&#8221; proved just the ticket, ramping up the energy while bridging the tone.
