There&#8217;s a difference between empathy and sympathy, and I&#8217;ve never believed that &#8220;The Night They Drove Old Dixie&#8221; down glorifies the Civil War South any more than &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/04/16/roll-of-the-dice-nebraska/\">Nebraska</a>&#8221; glorifies serial killers.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2o_wI53oAC4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down&#8221; isn&#8217;t even really about the American South&#8211;that&#8217;s just where it takes place. It&#8217;s about the human cost of war on those who survive it, regardless of the cause, and Robertson&#8217;s great accomplishment is in the way he brings the character of Virgil Caine to life through empathy that an American songwriter probably could never have mustered.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a strange song, with verses that ring with southern pain and loss paired with choruses bursting with northern celebration. (Or at least, that&#8217;s how it always sounded to me. I&#8217;ve read that Robertson intended his &#8220;na la las&#8221; as a wordless lament.) It sounds so incredibly authentic that it&#8217;s hard to believe it was written in 1969 rather than 1869, let alone by a Canadian Native-American.</p>\n<p>Last autumn, Robertson discussed the song&#8217;s origin and inspiration in an interview on Sirius XM.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Robbie Robertson Discusses Meaning Behind &quot;The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down&quot;\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gXSYm-CkUsE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>At a time when confederate flags, symbols, and statues are falling left and right, &#8220;The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down&#8221; is enduring Americana, recognized by <em>Rolling Stone</em> as one of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as one of 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll, and by <em>Time Magazine&#8217;s\u00a0</em>All-Time 100 list.</p>\n<p>To hear Levon Helm&#8217;s richly empathetic vocal is to immediately appreciate &#8220;The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down&#8221; as genuine, non-judgmental art, and that is almost certainly why the song is able to endure as a document (albeit fictional) of an awful period of American history.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been covered by bands both southern and northern, by artists both Black and White, including Joan Baez&#8217;s #3 hit version in 1971&#8230;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wanJQC5KAfo?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8230;and a Dobie Gray&#8217;s powerful live performance from 1980.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down - Dobie Gray - Volunteer Jam VI\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3SYtqI0PQLY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>And yet &#8220;The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down&#8221; was originally a B-side (to &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/01/29/meeting-across-the-river-bruce-springsteen-and-levon-helms-all-stars-up-on-cripple-creek/\">Up on Cripple Creek</a>&#8220;) only charting at #25 on the Billboard Hot 100.</p>\n<p>But that was enough to attract the attention of a young Bruce Springsteen, who turned 20 the week that &#8220;The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down&#8221; was released.</p>\n<p>Bruce has long professed to be a fan of The Band, most notably in this year&#8217;s documentary,\u00a0<em>Once Were Brothers.</em></p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Once Were Brothers: Robbie Robertson and The Band - Official Trailer\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZYTpMZjZxwI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>But there&#8217;s documented proof of Bruce&#8217;s appreciation as far back as almost fifty years.
