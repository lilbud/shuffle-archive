But curating these volumes requires revisiting everything I&#8217;ve written since 2018.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s an uncomfortable exercise at times.</p>\n<p>If I squint while reading <em>Roll of the Dice Volume 1: Greetings From Asbury Park, N.J.</em>, I can see glimpses of who I was at the time I wrote each essay, and hints of things changing within and around me.</p>\n<p>This volume, though, dares me to to maintain eye contact. Fittingly, given the video for its lead single.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Brilliant Disguise (Official Video)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/idnJnjV_8rg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>It&#8217;s not the writing per se. I think this collection contains some of my best essays, including the first one I was truly proud of (&#8220;Brilliant Disguise,&#8221; written barely one month into the blog).</p>\n<p>No, what&#8217;s hard to face is how much the essays in this book reveal to me what I was internally grappling with at the time, even if I wasn&#8217;t aware of it. Or what was coming just a couple of years down the road.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s hard to see when reading linearly, because the essays weren&#8217;t written in the order in which I&#8217;ve arranged them here.\u00a0But I can see it.</p>\n<p>And while some of it makes me wince, other parts make me laugh. In &#8220;Brilliant Disguise,&#8221; I wrote:</p>\n<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;if you\u2019re lucky enough to make it that far, you someday come to realize that the things you try to hide aren\u2019t really hidden, and of the things you choose to show, some are true and some are just who you want to be.&#8221;\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>That passage rings differently for me today than it did in February 2018. But that&#8217;s not what made me laugh. It&#8217;s the paragraph that follows:</p>\n<p><em>&#8220;At least that\u2019s how it feels to me today. But I won\u2019t be surprised if I have still another take down the road. That\u2019s the way it goes with Brilliant Disguise.'&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>It is indeed.</p>\n<p>And that doesn&#8217;t apply only to &#8220;Brilliant Disguise.&#8221; <em>Tunnel of Love </em>is a chameleon of an album. If it reveals its author&#8217;s internal life at the time he wrote it, it also lays bare our own at the time we hear it. Every time we hear it</p>\n<p>Pick a song from the album and ask me what it&#8217;s about. The answer I give will be different today than it would have been ten years ago, five years ago, or almost certainly five years from now.</p>\n<p>Several essays in this book would be different if I wrote them today, and I&#8217;m not sure I could say that about any other volume in this series.</p>\n<p>So with this volume perhaps more so than any other, your lens may differ from mine and from any other reader&#8217;s. Your take may not align with mine, and that&#8217;s cool.</p>\n<p>Sometimes it&#8217;s just nice to see through a different lens.</p>\n<p>\u00a9 December 1, 2025</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>A little note to explain the new posting schedule. </p>\n", "protected": false}, "author": 1, "featured_media": 0, "comment_status": "open", "ping_status": "open", "sticky": false, "template": "", "format": "standard", "meta": {"_monsterinsights_skip_tracking": false, "_monsterinsights_sitenote_active": false, "_monsterinsights_sitenote_note": "", "_monsterinsights_sitenote_category": 0, "jetpack_post_was_ever_published": false, "_jetpack_newsletter_access": "", "_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs": false, "_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id": 0, "_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content": false, "_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content": false, "footnotes": "", "jetpack_publicize_message": "", "jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled": true, "jetpack_social_post_already_shared": true, "jetpack_social_options": {"image_generator_settings": {"template": "highway", "default_image_id": 0, "font": "", "enabled": false}, "version": 2}}, "categories": [3604, 1], "tags": [], "class_list": ["post-34500", "post", "type-post", "status-publish", "format-standard", "hentry", "category-tunnel", "category-uncategorized"], "aioseo_notices": [], "jetpack_publicize_connections": [], "jetpack_featured_media_url": "", "jetpack_sharing_enabled": true, "jetpack_shortlink": "https://wp.me/p9w3Lk-8Ys", "jetpack_likes_enabled": true, "jetpack-related-posts": [{"id": 11737, "url": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/07/18/bloggers-note-long-walk-home-book-review-and-reader-mail/", "url_meta": {"origin": 34500, "position": 0}, "title": "&#8220;Long Walk Home&#8221; Book Review and Reader Mail", "author": "Ken", "date": "July 18, 2019", "format": false, "excerpt": "In which I review an upcoming book that marks Bruce's 70th birthday and answer a couple of frequently asked questions.", "rel": "", "context": "In \"Long Walk Home: Reflections on Bruce Springsteen\"", "block_context": {"text": "Long Walk Home: Reflections on Bruce Springsteen", "link": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/tag/long-walk-home-reflections-on-bruce-springsteen/"}, "img": {"alt_text": "", "src": "https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/lwh-1.jpg?fit=1000%2C1000&ssl=1&resize=350%2C200", "width": 350, "height": 200, "srcset": "https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/lwh-1.jpg?fit=1000%2C1000&ssl=1&resize=350%2C200 1x, https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/lwh-1.jpg?fit=1000%2C1000&ssl=1&resize=525%2C300 1.5x, https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/lwh-1.jpg?fit=1000%2C1000&ssl=1&resize=700%2C400 2x"}, "classes": []}, {"id": 62701, "url": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2025/11/05/announcing-the-e-street-shuffle-bookshelf-collection/", "url_meta": {"origin": 34500, "position": 1}, "title": "Announcing: The E Street Shuffle Bookshelf Collection", "author": "Ken", "date": "November 5, 2025", "format": false, "excerpt": "The blog is (almost) dead, long live the books!", "rel": "", "context": "Similar post", "block_context": {"text": "Similar post", "link": ""}, "img": {"alt_text": "", "src": "https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Gemini_Generated_Image_dd5vj9dd5vj9dd5v.png?fit=1024%2C1024&ssl=1&resize=350%2C200", "width": 350, "height": 200, "srcset": "https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Gemini_Generated_Image_dd5vj9dd5vj9dd5v.png?fit=1024%2C1024&ssl=1&resize=350%2C200 1x, https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Gemini_Generated_Image_dd5vj9dd5vj9dd5v.png?fit=1024%2C1024&ssl=1&resize=525%2C300 1.5x, https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Gemini_Generated_Image_dd5vj9dd5vj9dd5v.png?fit=1024%2C1024&ssl=1&resize=700%2C400 2x"}, "classes": []}, {"id": 32172, "url": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/01/04/year-four-complete/", "url_meta": {"origin": 34500, "position": 2}, "title": "Year Four: Complete!", "author": "Ken", "date": "January 4, 2022", "format": false, "excerpt": "Today marks the end of Year Four of this site's daily mission to document every song Bruce Springsteen has ever written, recorded, or performed in concert.
