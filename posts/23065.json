So it&#8217;s curious to see Sandy pop up on one of their albums, let alone the very next one following their collaboration with The Professor and The Mighty One.</p>\n<p>We can only speculate (since I&#8217;ve never seen any reporting on it either way) that the duo was either introduced to Bruce&#8217;s music by Max and Roy or inspired by them to check it out. Either way, they apparently were as enamored of Sandy as we all are.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s just too bad it didn&#8217;t translate into a better performance.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not an exaggeration to say they butchered Bruce&#8217;s lyrics, excising the middle couplet of each verse and leading off with an extra chorus. And as for the backing track&#8230; well, I suppose it conjure a sort of beachy vibe, but it&#8217;s definitely not the Jersey Shore sound.</p>\n<p>But hey, like I always say: if you&#8217;re gonna cover Bruce, do it better or do it different.</p>\n<p>This is different.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Sandy\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4RrVxoFQJRs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer;
