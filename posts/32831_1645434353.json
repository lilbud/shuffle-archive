The first version (recorded with the musicians who would become The Band) wouldn&#8217;t be released until 1991, when it appeared on <em>The Basement Tapes</em>, and again in a remixed version in 2014.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"I Shall be Released (Take 2)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oHL5Y-ZCTY8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>It was The Band, of course, who became identified with the song when they released it on their debut studio album in 1968 and brought the song to popular attention.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"I Shall Be Released (Remastered 2000)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/k9avKq94DGY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>But even\u00a0<em>that</em> wasn&#8217;t the first recording of &#8220;I Shall Be Released&#8221; to hit record store shelves. That honor belongs to Boz, who released his version not quite two months before The Band released theirs.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"BOZ:  &quot;I SHALL BE RELEASED&quot; 1968\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qt2AYtXCwnA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>See what I mean?</p>\n<p>Over the years, &#8220;I Shall Be Released&#8221; has been covered countless times, by artists such as Joni Mitchell, Joan Baez, Joe Cocker, Jeff Buckley, Melissa Etheridge, Sting, Bette Midler, Nina Simone, Jack Johnson, Kesha, and many, many more.</p>\n<p>Bruce Springsteen is not on that list, however. Despite his fondness for Dylan, he&#8217;s never covered this particular song in concert even once.</p>\n<p>He\u00a0<em>has</em> soundchecked it, though&#8211;once (that we know of) during the Tunnel of Love Express Tour in 1988. Before his show in Chapel Hill on March 4th, Bruce\u00a0 and the E Street Band worked up a warm, impromptu arrangement with an absolutely lovely saxophone solo by The Big Man.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"I shall be released ( Soundcheck )\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_n7u3qhxn80?start=85&#038;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Thematically, the song wouldn&#8217;t have fit with the tour&#8217;s romantic set list, so it&#8217;s easy to understand why this wonderful soundcheck performance never made it to an official stage. Fortunately for us, this &#8220;unofficial&#8221; performance was captured, so we can imagine what might have been.</p>\n<p><strong>I Shall Be Released<br />\nFirst performed:</strong> March 4, 1988
