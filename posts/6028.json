And while that year&#8217;s show may have had a more traditional holiday show theme, it was still full of surprises and delights: from opera star\u00a0Vittorio Grigolo, who brought the house down (I might like opera now), the always-amazing Darlene Love and Ronnie Spector, Sting vamping his way through Wham&#8217;s &#8220;Last Christmas,&#8221; and Idina Mendel fronting a choir for &#8220;Let it Go&#8221; (which, believe it or not, I&#8217;d never heard before then. I think I was the only one in the audience who had no clue what she was singing).</p>\n<p>Idina and James Taylor did a cute duet to &#8220;Baby, it&#8217;s Cold Outside,&#8221; (whatever your feelings about the song, their duet was pretty innocent), but Bruce just absolutely set the place on fire.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d never seen Bruce in such a small venue before (it was my first time at Carnegie Hall, and I was surprised by how intimate it felt), and I think he spent as much time in the aisles as on stage.</p>\n<p>He even made his entrance that way&#8211;announcing his arrival at the back of the hall with a hearty &#8220;ho ho ho,&#8221; giving the entire crowd instant whiplash as we collectively turned in shock to the sight of Bruce Springsteen moseying down the aisle, working the crowd in full Santa mode until he reached the stage, embraced his good friend, and launched into &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/12/24/cover-me-santa-claus-is-comin-to-town/\">Santa Claus is Comin&#8217; to Town</a>&#8221; backed by a full orchestra.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen, &quot;Santa Claus Is Coming To Town&quot;, Carnegie Hall, December 14, 2016\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vKDxpiv7AiA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Bruce then segued from &#8220;Santa&#8221; to his other perennial seasonal classic, &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/12/24/cover-me-merry-christmas-baby/\">Merry Christmas Baby</a>.&#8221; He&#8217;d only been on stage a few minutes, but he must have been restless, because he very quickly returned to the crowd,\u00a0 giving my row a\u00a0<em>very</em> close encounter.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen, &quot;Merry Christmas Baby&quot;, Carnegie Hall, December 14, 2016\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bhsJUCB5Gc8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>And then: the highlight of the night. I&#8217;m a big Lisa Fischer fan, and I had no idea she was even going to be at the show, much less share the stage with Bruce (she was not on the bill for the evening). But share the stage she did, for what may be my all-time favorite live performance of &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/11/19/roll-of-the-dice-tenth-avenue-freeze-out/\">Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out.</a>&#8221; The video can&#8217;t do it justice, but watch and listen anyway: Bruce, Lisa, and the orchestra transform Bruce&#8217;s 1975 origin story into something that sounds like it was originally issued on the Stax label instead of Columbia. &#8220;Tenth Avenue&#8221; sounded fresher and more soulfired than ever, and Lisa more than held her own sharing vocals with Bruce.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen &amp; Lisa Fischer, &quot;Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out&quot;, Carnegie Hall, December 14, 2016\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2YiWDXiBcN8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>How do you top that?
