(If you&#8217;re one of my UK or Irish readers, you&#8217;re probably familiar with Dexys&#8217; string of hits; if you&#8217;re reading this from elsewhere, you probably only know &#8220;Come on Eileen.&#8221;)</p>\n<p>Rowland went solo in 1988, and it did not go well. His album flopped, and Rowland lapsed into substance abuse, depression, and bankruptcy. It would take more than a decade and a great deal of treatment before Rowland tried again with an album full of covers, his 1999 release\u00a0<em>My Beauty</em>.</p>\n<p>Among the songs Rowland recorded for the album was &#8220;Thunder Road,&#8221; having secured permission from Bruce to include it,</p>\n<p>Then Bruce heard the finished recording, and he said: um, no.</p>\n<p>Why did Bruce take the unusual step of blocking the release of one of his songs after the artist had already recorded it? Take a listen and see if you can figure it out. (Warning: you won&#8217;t be able to unhear it.)</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Kevin Rowland (of Dexys Midnight Runners)  -   &quot;Thunder Road&quot;\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1x2S-7lu920?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, Bruce was not pleased with the alterations Rowland made to one of his most iconic songs, and he sent word that Rowland was welcome to re-record it as originally written. Rowland sent a personal note to Bruce petitioning him to reconsider, but Bruce held firm.</p>\n<p>(This wasn&#8217;t the first time Bruce nixed an already recorded cover, however&#8211;he&#8217;d done the same with <a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/11/26/cover-me-bette-midler-pink-cadillac/\">Bette Midler</a> for different reasons years earlier.)</p>\n<p>So that&#8217;s why\u00a0<em>My Beauty</em> went out with only eleven tracks instead of twelve, despite advance promotional hype and advance copies that included it (&#8220;Thunder Road&#8221; was mentioned in some early media reviews, written by reviewers who had received the advance copies before Bruce forced the removal of his song.)</p>\n<p>The original promotional album has become something of a collector&#8217;s item since then, so if you&#8217;re a completist who&#8217;s been searching for it&#8230;\u00a0 just make sure you listen to the song here first.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>Quite possibly the worst Springsteen cover ever recorded, Kevin Rowland&#8217;s version of &#8220;Thunder Road&#8221; was blocked by Bruce shortly before its scheduled release.
