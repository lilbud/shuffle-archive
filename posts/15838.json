And if he&#8217;s been plagued by demons like the rest of us, he can at least take satisfaction knowing he&#8217;s faced them and (for the most part) manages to keep them under control with the support of his family and good friends.</p>\n<p>Still, won&#8217;t you join me in a sympathetic wince on Bruce&#8217;s behalf? Because despite the incredible polished body of work he&#8217;s produced over the years, there&#8217;s a ton of unfinished and unrecorded songs floating around that he almost certainly never intended to see the light of day.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s bad enough that pages circulate from <a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/tag/1968-notebook/\">his songwriting notebook</a> from as far back as the age of eighteen. (How would you feel if your 18-year-old self&#8217;s poems and songs found their way onto the Internet?)</p>\n<p>But when an untitled page of original Springsteen lyrics surfaced in <a href=\"https://www.hakes.com/Auction/ItemDetail/59442/BRUCE-SPRINGSTEEN-HAND-WRITTEN-UNPUBLISHED-LYRICS\">an on-line auction in 2010</a>, and the auction site helpfully labeled the song &#8220;Vaginal Vandals&#8221; (after a phrase that appears in the song but which in no way represents what the song is actually about)&#8230; well, I have to imagine there was some cringing in the Springsteen household that day.</p>\n<p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-attachment-id=\"15839\" data-permalink=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/02/19/roll-of-the-dice-vaginal-vandals/vagvandals/#main\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/vagvandals.jpg?fit=557%2C864&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"557,864\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"vagvandals\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/vagvandals.jpg?fit=193%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/vagvandals.jpg?fit=557%2C864&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/vagvandals-193x300.jpg?resize=758%2C1178\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-15839\" alt=\"\" width=\"758\" height=\"1178\"></p>\n<p>Nevertheless, it&#8217;s a Springsteen-authored song (or at least the beginnings of one), and it&#8217;s out there, so according to my self-imposed rules, I gotta cover it.</p>\n<p>And honestly, once we get past the awkward title&#8211;and I must point out that there&#8217;s no evidence on the page that Bruce had a title in mind yet, let alone this one&#8211;we actually have the seed of what might have turned into a fascinating early song. (Based on the themes and the notebook paper, I would peg these lyrics circa 1971 or 1972. (There are other escapees from this time period written on notebook paper that appear to match this one.))</p>\n<p>&#8220;Vaginal Vandals&#8221; (we&#8217;re just going to have to call it that) focuses on a rebellious Catholic schoolboy, and while Bruce never really develops a plot, his first couplet does an admirable job of setting the stage.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px\"><em>She forgot you quit the altar boys &#8217;cause you couldn&#8217;t reach the candles</em><br />\n<em>They banned you from the sacristy, so you went and joined the vaginal vandals</em></p>\n<p>We can also see what he was reaching for with that provocative phrase&#8211;more than a clever rhyme, it&#8217;s a two-word way of conveying that Bruce&#8217;s character traded his religious and academic devotion for more earthly pursuits&#8211;and yet, despite the bravado that he conveys throughout, there&#8217;s a sense that he&#8217;s not quite convincing himself with his rationalization, and that he can&#8217;t help but view his revolt through the lens the church fashioned for him.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px\"><em>You broke into the church and raided the poor box figuring you qualified</em><br />\n<em>You skipped school and never changed your sox so mama would know where you stand</em></p>\n<p>That last line is both clever and puerile, and with it Bruce establishes that our point-of-view character is probably rebelling more out of instinct than principle. The next couplet underlines that notion&#8211;the character&#8217;s impatience and frustration is palpable:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px\"><em>The nuns made you sit and listen to them give piano lessons, Oh holy in excelsis in A minor</em><br />\n<em>If you ever needed muzak for an insane asylum, you&#8217;d sign her</em></p>\n<p>From here, the pages devolves into snippets and phrases that Bruce was probably trying out: &#8220;hot rods and high school gods,&#8221; &#8220;senior class clod,&#8221; &#8220;ripened rifle range boys&#8221; and a reference to the Future Farmers of America suggest that &#8220;Vaginal Vandals&#8221; is more concerned with rebelling against school than against religion. (I&#8217;d love to know where Bruce would have taken that &#8220;I poured bourbon in my turbine&#8221; line though&#8211;that&#8217;s an awesome rhyme and terrific metaphor that would have been right at home in &#8220;Blinded by the Light.&#8221;)</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll likely never know for sure what Bruce had in mind when he wrote these lyrics.</p>\n<p>Many of Bruce&#8217;s early songs&#8211;even his unfinished ones&#8211;contain lines, phrases, or images that would appear in his later work, but &#8220;Vaginal Vandals&#8221; appears unique and apart while still reflecting a very promising Springsteenian style.</p>\n<p>If only it wasn&#8217;t saddled with that title.</p>\n<p><strong>Vaginal Vandals</strong><br />\n<strong>Never recorded</strong><br />\n<strong>Never performed</strong></p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
