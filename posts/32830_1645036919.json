Critics took notice of the influence, and comparisons were common.</p>\n<p>Perhaps it was one of those comparisons that got Bruce&#8217;s attention. Whatever it was, Bruce invited Jesse to join him on stage during his 2003 holiday benefit show stand in Asbury Park. Jesse got to play two of his own songs each night with Bruce, an invaluable visibility boost for a solo artist&#8217;s debut album.</p>\n<p>We listened to one of those two songs, &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/09/05/matr-jesse-malin-and-bruce-springsteen-wendy/\">Wendy</a>,&#8221; a couple of years ago. But it was &#8220;Queen of the Underworld&#8221; that marked Jesse and Bruce&#8217;s first on-stage collaboration, with a terrific performance that featured Jesse on lead vocals and Bruce on backing vocals and a prominent guitar solo.</p>\n<div id=\"v-tINU0O8J-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='568'
