Seeger recorded a new version of the song featuring Musselman&#8217;s verse with Ani DiFranco, Steve Earle, and Billy Bragg for a compilation released that same year.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bring Them Home (If You Love Your Uncle Sam)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/85kukLVG_Ho?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Three years later, Bruce took Musselman&#8217;s first verse and Seeger&#8217;s second verse and then wrote two new verses of his own:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>They wanna test their grand theories</em><br />\n<em>Bring them home, bring them home</em><br />\n<em>With the blood of you and me</em><br />\n<em>Bring them home, bring them home</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Now we&#8217;ll give no more brave young lives</em><br />\n<em>Bring them home, bring them home</em><br />\n<em>For the gleam in someone&#8217;s eyes</em><br />\n<em>Bring them home, bring them home</em></p>\n<p>But Bruce wasn&#8217;t done yet&#8211;he borrowed and adapted two verses from the standard &#8220;When Johnny Comes Marching Home&#8221;&#8230;.</p>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\">&#8220;When Johnny Comes Marching Home&#8221;</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\">&#8220;Bring &#8216;Em Home&#8221;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\"><em>The men will cheer and the boys will shout</em><br />\n<em>The ladies they will all turn out</em><br />\n<em><span class=\"mw-poem-indented\">And we&#8217;ll all feel gay</span></em><br />\n<em>When Johnny comes marching home.</em><em>The old church bell will peal with joy</em><br />\n<em><span class=\"mw-poem-indented\">Hurrah!

There&#8217;s no debating its power, however. Although not nearly as angry as Seeger&#8217;s original song, Bruce&#8217;s version captures the patriotism of Seeger&#8217;s original and the longing in &#8220;When Johnny Comes Marching Home&#8221; to produce a mash-up that perfectly captures the heartache and sacrifice of the families of soldiers overseas.</p>\n<p>Bruce recorded his new version of &#8220;Bring &#8216;Em Home&#8221; in Oslo while on tour with the Sessions Band in 2006. While never officially released on disc, that studio version was very briefly available as an Internet download, and you can hear it below.</p>\n<!--[if lt IE 9]><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\">document.createElement('audio');</script><![endif]-->\n<audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-27624-1\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Bruce-Springsteen-Bring-Them-Home-Studio-online-audio-converter.com_.mp3?_=1\" /><a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Bruce-Springsteen-Bring-Them-Home-Studio-online-audio-converter.com_.mp3\">https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Bruce-Springsteen-Bring-Them-Home-Studio-online-audio-converter.com_.mp3</a></audio>\n<p>Bruce had already debuted &#8220;Bring &#8216;Em Home&#8221; in concert the week prior in Paris.
