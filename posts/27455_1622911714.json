(I still can&#8217;t wrap my head around how &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/01/13/roll-of-the-dice-cover-me/\">Cover Me</a>&#8221; fared so well by comparison.)</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m Goin&#8217; Down&#8221; is also arguably the least substantial track on the album, with only &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/09/10/roll-of-the-dice-darlington-county/\">Darlington County</a>&#8221; rivalling it for comic relief value. But If that sounds like I&#8217;m being dismissive, I&#8217;m not&#8211;&#8220;I&#8217;m Goin&#8217; Down&#8221; is a contender for Bruce&#8217;s best pop song, and one of the E Street Band&#8217;s finest (or at least funnest) moments on record.</p>\n<p>The boys sound like they&#8217;re having a blast, and even without visuals, their energy and playfulness are infectious&#8211;especially during the instrumental bridge and wordless outro, where Bruce and the band vamp like their lives depend on it. (And that&#8217;s just in the released version&#8211;if you haven&#8217;t heard the unreleased extended version, you&#8217;re in for a delight at the end of this post.)</p>\n<p>As I alluded at the top, &#8220;I&#8217;m Goin&#8217; Down,&#8221; bears more than a little lyrical resemblance to &#8220;Fire.&#8221; Both songs revolve around a sexually frustrated narrator, but whereas &#8220;Fire&#8221; is a taut, smoldering snapshot of a couple at the onset of a relationship (if it ever became one&#8211;by today&#8217;s standards, it&#8217;s kind of a creepy song), &#8220;I&#8217;m Goin&#8217; Down&#8221; takes us to what seems to be its imminent dissolution.</p>\n<p>Both songs even start in the same place: the narrator&#8217;s car. And if you compare the first verse of each song, it sure seems like Bruce was intentionally inviting comparison.</p>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 50%; text-align: center;\">&#8220;Fire&#8221;</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50%; text-align: center;\">&#8220;I&#8217;m Goin&#8217; Down&#8221;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><em>I&#8217;m driving in my car, I turn on the radio</em></span><br />\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><em>I&#8217;m pulling you close, you just say no</em></span><br />\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><em>You say you don&#8217;t like it, but girl I know you&#8217;re a liar</em></span><br />\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><em>&#8216;Cause when we kiss, oh, fire</em></span></td>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><em>We sit in the car outside your house, you&#8217;re quiet, I can feel the heat coming &#8217;round</em></span><br />\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><em>I go to put my arm around you and you give me a look like I&#8217;m way out of bounds</em></span><br />\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><em>Well, you let out one of your bored sighs, well lately when I look into your eyes</em></span><br />\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><em>I&#8217;m going down, down, down, down</em></span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The songs diverge from there, and neither rewards lyrical analysis. &#8220;Fire&#8221; and &#8220;I&#8217;m Goin&#8217; Down&#8221; are both pop songs, and Bruce puts everything on the surface.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>We get dressed up and we go out, baby, for the night</em><br />\n<em>We come home early burning, burning, burning in some fire fight</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;m sick and tired of you setting me up, yeah, setting me up just to</em><br />\n<em>Knock-a, knock-a, knock-a me down, down, down, down</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;m going down, down, down, down</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I pull you close now baby, but when we kiss I can feel a doubt</em><br />\n<em>I remember back when we started, my kisses used to turn you inside out</em><br />\n<em>I used to drive you to work in the morning, Friday night I&#8217;d drive you all around and</em><br />\n<em>You used to love to drive me wild, yeah, but lately girl you get your kicks from just</em><br />\n<em>Driving me down, down, down, down</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;m going down, down, down, down</em></p>\n<p>But just because &#8220;I&#8217;m Goin&#8217; Down&#8221; is lyrically light doesn&#8217;t mean it isn&#8217;t skillfully crafted. There&#8217;s a reason why it became a big radio hit, and it&#8217;s the same reason you probably love singing along to it on the radio or in concert.</p>\n<p>Perhaps more than any other song in Bruce&#8217;s catalog, &#8220;I&#8217;m Goin&#8217; Down&#8221; is about phonics more than lyrics.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a term for random syllables that are just plain fun to sing&#8211;it&#8217;s called\u00a0<em>vocalise</em>, and it&#8217;s at the heart of the doo-wop branch of rock and roll. &#8220;Down&#8221; is one of those syllables. Bruce knew it&#8211;whether consciously or sub-consciously&#8211;and built a song around it. &#8220;I&#8217;m Goin&#8217; Down&#8221; repeats that classic doo-wop &#8220;down&#8221; syllable <em>eighty times, </em>and it probably brings a smile to your face each time you sing it.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not the only vocalised trick Bruce pulls out of his hat&#8211;there&#8217;s also the &#8220;knock-a knock-a knock-a&#8221; is well. (Pairing it with the &#8220;down down down&#8221; results in one of my favorite lyrical lines in Bruce&#8217;s entire catalog.)</p>\n<p>Bruce took lessons from the genre and added a couple of his own twists: first, he turned nonsense syllables into actual words&#8211;achieving the same phonic impact of songs like Barry Mann and Gerry Goffin&#8217;s &#8220;Who Put the Bomp&#8221; without it seeming gratuitous.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Who Put The Bomp - Barry Mann\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lXmsLe8t_gg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Secondly, there&#8217;s irony on display: as Mann and Goffin note in their song, doo wop syllables typically have an alluring rather than off-putting effect, which helps explain why even though it&#8217;s an angry song, &#8220;I&#8217;m Goin&#8217; Down&#8221; is just a ton of fun to sing.</p>\n<p>And then of course there&#8217;s the band.</p>\n<p>Every E Streeter shines throughout. Max is the most prominent, but Clarence takes a terrific solo, Roy is at his honky-tonk best, Danny is all over the track, and even Garry gets an unusual workout. And the importance of Steve&#8217;s mandolin cannot be omitted&#8211;it sets our expectation for a romantic tale so that Bruce can quickly pull the rug out from under us.</p>\n<p>The best part of the song is the song&#8217;s final minute, where the band vamps in tight formation while Bruce scats his way into the sunset. It&#8217;s one of my favorite E Street studio minutes, and like I mentioned earlier, it&#8217;s even better in its unabridged form. Here&#8217;s an unreleased take featuring an outro that&#8217;s as long as the song itself&#8211;turn up the volume and enjoy.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"I&#039;m Going Down - Bruce Springsteen RARE version!\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aaKRByNhb0Y?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>And to think &#8220;I&#8217;m Goin&#8217; Down&#8221; almost didn&#8217;t make the record.</p>\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t an afterthought&#8211;in fact, it was one of the earlier songs recorded for\u00a0<em>Born in the U.S.A.</em> on the heels of the\u00a0<em>Nebraska</em> sessions, and it was slotted for Bruce&#8217;s next album from the beginning. But somewhere along the line it was shelved, and only at the last minute did Bruce add it back. (Early promotional copies of <em>Born in the U.S.A.</em> didn&#8217;t include &#8220;I&#8217;m Goin&#8217; Down&#8221;&#8211;that&#8217;s how late an addition it was.)</p>\n<p>In concert, &#8220;I&#8217;m Goin&#8217; Down&#8221; was an immediate hit. Bruce typically hammed it up with an introductory explanation (as if the song required any).</p>\n<div id=\"v-ZN88tTQy-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='426' src='https://videopress.com/embed/ZN88tTQy?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>And while it&#8217;s been a lot more difficult to catch &#8220;I&#8217;m Goin&#8217; Down&#8221; in concert since the Born in the U.S.A. tour ended (it didn&#8217;t even show up again until the Rising Tour), it&#8217;s made enough appearances over the last decade and a half to be considered a decent-odds selection if you&#8217;re chasing it.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s one of Bruce&#8217;s best recent performances, from the Wrecking Ball Tour in 2013.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - I&#039;m Goin&#039; Down (from Born In The U.S.A.
