There are a few lyrical rough edges that suggest that Bruce wasn&#8217;t quite done polishing it, but it&#8217;s clearly &#8220;content complete.&#8221; It features Bruce in the taut storytelling mode of his recent\u00a0<em>Nebraska</em> album, but it isn&#8217;t hard to imagine &#8220;The Klansman&#8221; in an electric arrangement on\u00a0<em>Born in the U.S.A.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>The melody is sinister and foreboding (Bruce plays every instrument); we know that something bad is afoot almost before Bruce lays it out in the opening verse:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Word of the trouble spread around</em><br />\n<em>One day a man came to my town</em><br />\n<em>In the kitchen when my Pa let him in</em><br />\n<em>He shook my hand, said, &#8220;Son, the Klan&#8217;s your friend&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>We never learn what the &#8220;trouble&#8221; is, but given the greeting of the mysterious visitor, it isn&#8217;t hard to imagine. The recruiter continues&#8211;presumably addressing the father now:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&#8220;Was a meeting at Lyle Stanton&#8217;s house on the Jefferson Highway</em><br />\n<em>Some they did not listen, some did not turn away&#8221;</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Said, &#8220;When the holy rain of fire comes tumbling from above</em><br />\n<em>It&#8217;ll be a Klansman who stands for the land he loves&#8221;</em><br />\n<em>Look away, look away now</em></p>\n<p>That&#8217;s a pretty strong pitch. We&#8217;re left to wonder how the father will react during a short instrumental interlude, and then the story continues, some time later:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I was ten years old when my Pa said, &#8220;Son, some day you will see</em><br />\n<em>When you grow to wear the robes like your brother and me&#8221;</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&#8220;When the war between the races leaves us in a fiery dream</em><br />\n<em>It&#8217;ll be a Klansman who will wipe this country clean</em><br />\n<em>This, son, is my dream&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>Bruce&#8217;s vocals give nothing away&#8211;his delivery is unflinching. We can discern neither a young boy&#8217;s pride in his father nor a grown man&#8217;s shame.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re left to wonder which path the boy chose for himself, which is undoubtedly the exact effect Bruce was aiming for.</p>\n<p>Rumors still fly about a someday-soon box set treatment for\u00a0<em>Born in the U.S.A. </em>and its contemporary outtakes. Odds are good&#8211;or at least they <em>should</em> be&#8211;that &#8220;The Klansman&#8221; will finally see a release if and when.</p>\n<p><strong>The Klansman<br />\n</strong><strong>Recorded:\u00a0</strong>March 10, 1983<br />\n<strong>Never released<br />\n</strong><strong>Never performed</strong></p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
