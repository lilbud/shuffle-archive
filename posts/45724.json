Audiences viscerally responded to David Ruffin&#8217;s anguished, impassioned vocals, but few knew the tragedy that imbued the lyrics.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"I Wish It Would Rain\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/keDpxp892Og?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>In the spring of 1967, songwriter Roger Penzabene discovered his wife was having an affair. Consumed with betrayal, he poured his pain into a song about a man so miserable that he hides himself from the world, hoping for rainfall to mask his tears so that he might walk the world freely and without shame.</p>\n<p>The Temptations recorded &#8220;I Wish It Would Rain&#8221; that summer and released it on December 21st. Ten days later, Penzabene took his own life.</p>\n<p>Unaware of the tragic backstory, audiences nevertheless flocked to &#8220;I Wish It Would Rain,&#8221; drawn in by Ruffin&#8217;s vocals set starkly against a minimalist arrangement.</p>\n<p>When the strings enter about halfway through, one can&#8217;t help but notice the similarity to The Temptations&#8217; earlier hit, &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/10/26/matr-the-temptations-the-wallflowers-and-bruce-springsteen-my-girl/\">My Girl.</a>&#8221; In fact, from the very first line (&#8220;Sunshine, blue skies, please go away&#8221;), &#8220;I Wish It Would Rain&#8221; sounds like a mournful answer song. I&#8217;ve never seen it hypothesized, much less confirmed, but I wouldn&#8217;t be at all surprised if that was by design.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"I Wish It Would Rain\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/X-itA2rv8p4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;I Wish It Would Rain&#8221; climbed the charts swiftly, peaking in February. It soon became a melancholy R&amp;B standard, covered over the years by heavyweights like Aretha Franklin, Marvin Gaye, Tina Turner, and Gladys Knight.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s some serious talent to throw down with, but Springsteen wasn&#8217;t deterred. He understood that &#8220;I Wish It Would Rain&#8221; dares any contender to meet it in a place of anguish, and Bruce gave it his all.\u00a0 He matched Ruffin growl for growl while adding a layer of vulnerability via his inimitable falsetto.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - I Wish It Would Rain (Official Audio)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iZ6Ojns6Fs0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>The arrangement is faithful, even if the antagonist isn&#8217;t, and the lyrical changes are tactfully minor. (Bruce sings &#8220;My girl has found another and gone <em>astray</em>&#8221; instead of &#8220;gone <em>away,</em>&#8221; a small but fitting substitution.)</p>\n<p>The finished track is one of Bruce&#8217;s favorites on the album. &#8220;I just felt great,&#8221; he recollected to Greene. &#8220;It came out great, so we used it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s one of my favorites, too.
