While today&#8217;s entry is undated, lyrically it seems in keeping with Bruce&#8217;s post Steel Mill but pre-label days, so let&#8217;s peg it to the early 1970s.</p>\n<p>The song appears to have multiple titles: at the top of the page is &#8220;Daddy Long Legs / Baby Son,&#8221; and just below it is &#8220;Phantom Love\u00a0 (Just 16).&#8221;</p>\n<p>Only the &#8220;phantom love&#8221; phrase appears in the lyrics themselves, though, so let&#8217;s assume that the &#8220;daddy long legs/baby son&#8221; is an orphan.</p>\n<p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-attachment-id=\"20629\" data-permalink=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/08/19/roll-of-the-dice-phantom-love-just-16/phantomlove_lyrics/#main\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/phantomlove_lyrics.jpg?fit=720%2C898&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"720,898\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"phantomlove_lyrics\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/phantomlove_lyrics.jpg?fit=241%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/phantomlove_lyrics.jpg?fit=720%2C898&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-20629\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/phantomlove_lyrics-241x300.jpg?resize=758%2C944\" alt=\"\" width=\"758\" height=\"944\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/phantomlove_lyrics.jpg?resize=241%2C300&amp;ssl=1 241w, https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/phantomlove_lyrics.jpg?w=720&amp;ssl=1 720w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 758px) 100vw, 758px\" /></p>\n<p>&#8220;Phantom Love (Just 16)&#8221; is a bit tough to analyze, because it seems very much like a work in progress. There are no chord notations to give us a sense of its musicality, but the lack of obvious meter or external rhyme scheme suggests that it was probably a slower song (if a song at all).</p>\n<p>Bruce also seems to be having trouble with the first verse, scratching out phrases, overwriting and adding parentheticals to a point that makes it almost impossible to determine what he intended as the final product:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Phantom love I will chase in exile down St. Christopher</em><br />\n<em>Without armor or audience (fancy studs) till your beast lover (lover men) turn child</em><br />\n<em>In search of a softer quieter lie</em><br />\n<em>She moves in a ballerina suit tight and quick</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;m steppin&#8217; in buckle boots slick and sharp</em></p>\n<p>What we can make out appears to be the beginning of a would-be romance between lovers from different worlds. The second verse is clearer and more confident, though. The phrase &#8220;softer, quieter lie&#8221; appears to be a recurring theme, a nice notion for a pair that seem to\u00a0<em>want </em>to be in love but can&#8217;t quite manage to get there.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Chase the little hood down through the fire wood</em><br />\n<em>And we&#8217;ll walk together once again in search of that softer quieter lie</em><br />\n<em>And I&#8217;ll really believe that I want you</em><br />\n<em>And you&#8217;ll really believe you need me</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Did I tell you, Bobby, I got me a phantom love</em></p>\n<p>That&#8217;s all we get. As far as we know, &#8220;Phantom Love (Just 16)&#8221; never evolved into anything more; not a single phrase appears elsewhere in Bruce&#8217;s catalog.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll chalk this one up to a songwriter&#8217;s experiment, one of what must be countless hidden away in the pages of Bruce&#8217;s decades of notebooks.</p>\n<p><strong>Phantom Love (Just 16)<br />\nNever recorded</strong><br />\n<strong>Never released</strong><br />\n<strong>Never performed</strong></p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
