After a hot show at Penn State University on the Wrecking Ball Tour, Bruce felt like the crowd needed just one more song before he sent them off into the night. Recalling a sign for it that he&#8217;d seen earlier in the show (but probably and correctly felt was better placed in the encore than the main set), he audibled &#8220;Shout,&#8221; conferred with the band and launched into it.</p>\n<p>That performance was captured on video, and it&#8217;s a joy to watch. You can tell that the band hadn&#8217;t rehearsed it&#8211;their performance is all over the place and Bruce skips lines, verses and skips forward and backward throughout the song.</p>\n<p>But who cares when the band and the audience are having this much fun?</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen SHOUT State College 2012-11-01 MULTICAM!!!\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WbUwUAqgooU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Despite that terrifically fun encore, it appeared that &#8220;Shout&#8221; was destined to be a one-off. That is, until Bruce played it again the following summer. And again. And again. And again, until by the end of the Wrecking Ball Tour, it appeared that Bruce had a new official show closer.</p>\n<p>When the High Hopes Tour picked up where the Wrecking Ball Tour left off, &#8220;Shout&#8221; was still a rock-solid reliable encore, as its been ever since.</p>\n<p>Bruce has played the song so many times over the last decade, in fact, that it&#8217;s almost impossible to choose a single representative or &#8220;best&#8221; performance. In typical Springsteen fashion, the song continued to grow in length and shtick with each passing tour. By mid-way through the River Tour (the 2016 version), Bruce had even revived his old &#8220;carry me out on the stretcher&#8221; routine to draw the song out even longer.</p>\n<p>But as far as videos go, this one from New York City early in the River Tour is one of my favorites. Although the editing isn&#8217;t always spot-on, it does a great job of capturing the feeling of spontaneity that Bruce brings every night&#8211;even though he plays the song every night.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Shout\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZffPYAhv1S0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Bruce may have been a late convert to including &#8220;Shout&#8221; in his set, but he&#8217;s sure made up for lost time&#8211;as of this writing, he&#8217;s performed it 126 times since 2013.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d bet on that number getting a lot higher.</p>\n<p><strong>Shout<br />\nFirst performed:</strong> December 31, 1982 (New York City, NY)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> February 25, 2017 (Auckland, New Zealand)</p>\n<p>(c) September 12, 2019</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>A late, last-minute sign request leads to an ever-after show-closing encore.</p>\n", "protected": false}, "author": 1, "featured_media": 12738, "comment_status": "open", "ping_status": "open", "sticky": false, "template": "", "format": "standard", "meta": {"_monsterinsights_skip_tracking": false, "_monsterinsights_sitenote_active": false, "_monsterinsights_sitenote_note": "", "_monsterinsights_sitenote_category": 0, "jetpack_post_was_ever_published": false, "_jetpack_newsletter_access": "", "_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs": false, "_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id": 0, "_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content": false, "_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content": false, "footnotes": "", "jetpack_publicize_message": "", "jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled": true, "jetpack_social_post_already_shared": true, "jetpack_social_options": {"image_generator_settings": {"template": "highway", "default_image_id": 0, "font": "", "enabled": false}, "version": 2}}, "categories": [4, 3603], "tags": [688, 2457], "class_list": ["post-11633", "post", "type-post", "status-publish", "format-standard", "has-post-thumbnail", "hentry", "category-cover-me", "category-encore", "tag-shout", "tag-the-isley-brothers"], "aioseo_notices": [], "jetpack_publicize_connections": [], "jetpack_featured_media_url": "https://i0.wp.com/estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/shout.jpg?fit=1087%2C1081&ssl=1", "jetpack_sharing_enabled": true, "jetpack_shortlink": "https://wp.me/p9w3Lk-31D", "jetpack_likes_enabled": true, "jetpack-related-posts": [{"id": 12476, "url": "https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/09/04/roll-of-the-dice-changing-children/", "url_meta": {"origin": 11633, "position": 0}, "title": "Roll of the Dice: Changing Children", "author": "Ken", "date": "September 4, 2019", "format": false, "excerpt": "At the dawn of the 1970s, even Bruce couldn't help but be a little cynical about the likelihood of real change.
