(It&#8217;s amazing that anything survives from the Castiles era at all. Who could have predicted Bruce&#8217;s rise to fame back then?)</p>\n<p>In fact, even though Bruce has covered &#8220;Money (That&#8217;s What I Want)&#8221; at least a half-dozen times over the years, it&#8217;s maddeningly difficult to track down audio evidence of it, since none of those times were during an &#8220;official&#8221; concert, E Street or otherwise.</p>\n<p>But we do have two vintage recordings of Bruce covering this R&amp;B classic, both dating back to surprise Jersey shore club appearances in the 1980s.</p>\n<p>The first was with Beaver Brown at the short-lived Big Man&#8217;s West in February 1982. The recording is muddy, but it&#8217;s clear enough to tell just how hot a performance it was on what must have been a very cold night:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - MONEY 1982 (audio)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6izI6xtDOf8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>The next time Bruce covered &#8220;Money&#8221; was more than five years later&#8211;this time at The Stone Pony in Asbury Park in the summer of 1987, during a rare full E Street Band appearance (almost, anyway&#8211;Nils wasn&#8217;t there that night) at the legendary club.
