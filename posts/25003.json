(The venue changed names a few times along the way.)</p>\n<p>Bruce was established enough locally to not only draw crowds but bootleggers, too, leading to a collection of fine (for their age) documents of this pre-E Street stand.</p>\n<p>The stand may have been pre-E Street, but the band wasn&#8217;t: the five-man combo consisted of Bruce, Steve Van Zandt, Garry Tallent, David Sancious, and Vini Lopez. Only Clarence and Danny had yet to join the original line-up.</p>\n<p>At the opening show of their Back Door residency, The Bruce Springsteen Band was joined by Southside Johnny, already known for his impressive harmonica skills. Bruce gave Southside a spotlight that night on Jimmy Reed&#8217;s &#8220;Bright Lights, Big City.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Reed&#8217;s song was a decade old by that time and already a standard for any self-respecting blues band. Notching in at #3 on the Billboard R&amp;B chart, &#8220;Bright Lights, Big City&#8221; also charted at #58 on the Hot 100, earning it broad mainstream appeal as well.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bright Lights, Big City\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q5gTmNKrj9s?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>For The Bruce Springsteen Band, &#8220;Bright Lights, Big City&#8221; was an excuse to strut their instrumental stuff. Jimmy Reed&#8217;s original wasn&#8217;t even three minutes long; Bruce&#8217;s version was <em>fourteen</em>.</p>\n<p>Bookended by cool, smoky grooves, the band truly breaks loose in the middle segment where we get one jaw-dropping solo after another. Check out Southside&#8217;s harp solo at the four-minute mark, for example, and then again just before the six-minute mark.</p>\n<div id=\"v-bejHBCRN-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='568' src='https://videopress.com/embed/bejHBCRN?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>Sancious gets his turn shortly before the seven-minute mark, and Bruce reminds us why he&#8217;d earned his hot-shot guitarist reputation at about 8:30.</p>\n<p>This second and last known Bruce Springsteen Band performance of &#8220;Bright Lights, Big City&#8221; (the first is from the previous year and nowhere near as impressive in either audio or performance quality) was one of the highlights from that entire February stand.</p>\n<p>Bruce would end his eponymous band by that summer; by the fall, he&#8217;d begin touring for his first album. But that first half of 1972 brought a collection of smoking, stunning pre-fame performances by a band that would soon set the world on fire.</p>\n<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> Bruce played &#8220;Bright Lights, Big City,&#8221; only once more after his Bruce Springsteen Band era. Just before he reached his peak of popularity in the summer of 1984, Bruce joined John Eddie &amp; The Front Street Runners on stage at The Stone Pony.</p>\n<p>Bruce joined John for four songs that night, one of which was a cover of the Jimmy Read classic. That performance was captured, too. It sounds a lot more like what we&#8217;d expect a Springsteen cover of &#8220;Bright Lights, Big City&#8221; to sound like, but I prefer the swinging 1972 version to the hard-rocking &#8217;84 one.</p>\n<div id=\"v-2fWEho97-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='568'
