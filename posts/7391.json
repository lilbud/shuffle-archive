He&#8217;s done that on a spectrum that spans from &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/12/08/rotd-cover-me-how-can-a-poor-man-stand-such-times-and-live/\">How Can a Poor Man Stand Such Times and Live?</a>&#8221; to &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/07/24/cover-me-roll-of-the-dice-jersey-girl/\">Jersey Girl</a>,&#8221; from &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/01/21/cover-me-hard-times-come-again-no-more/\">Hard Times Come Again No More</a>&#8221; to &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/08/05/roll-of-the-dice-cover-me-trapped/\">Trapped</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But of all the songs Bruce has taken liberties with, Woody Guthrie&#8217;s &#8220;I Ain&#8217;t Got No Home&#8221; is perhaps the most fitting, because Guthrie himself is very likely Bruce&#8217;s patron saint when it comes to musical adaptations.</p>\n<p>In fact, Guthrie took liberties himself with this song, lifting and responding to the traditional hymn, &#8220;I Can&#8217;t Feel at Home in this World Anymore.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"The Carter Family - Can&#039;t Feel at Home\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yE3kW9-tjO8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>The original song encourages the poor to consider their suffering on this earth as advance payment for eternal reward in the afterlife. Guthrie had a problem with that notion, so he used the same melody and lyrical structure to instead shed light and awareness on those who\u00a0<em>truly</em> had no home in the world.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"I Ain&#039;t Got No Home In This World Anymore - Woody Guthrie\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GTnVMulDTYA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>That song struck a chord with Bruce. When asked to contribute a recording for a tribute album for Guthrie (and Leadbelly), Bruce provided not one but two: &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/09/14/cover-me-vigilante-man/\">Vigilante Man,</a>&#8221; and &#8220;I Ain&#8217;t Got No Home.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Bruce recorded &#8220;I Ain&#8217;t Got No Home&#8221; in his home studio, in a quiet, vulnerable arrangement that features just him, Roy, and Nils. Bruce changed the lyrics, making the song both more modern and more inclusive. (Guthrie&#8217;s version focused on the plight of the agrarian poor.) Both songs were released in August 1988 on the album\u00a0<em>Folkways: A Vision Shared</em>.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"I Ain&#039;t Got No Home\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QeSrR1X65EA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Bruce didn&#8217;t stop there, however&#8211;he also contributed a live performance to the album&#8217;s companion documentary film. That performance (recorded at a Madison Square Garden soundcheck on May 19, 1988) has a bit more simmering anger seeping through. It&#8217;s seldom seen, and rarely available on-line&#8211;but you can watch it here:</p>\n<div id=\"v-lghEHeHY-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='562' src='https://videopress.com/embed/lghEHeHY?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>In concert, &#8220;I Ain&#8217;t Got No Home&#8221; is a bona fide rarity, appearing just often enough (at least once but no more then three times in each decade since its release) to assure us that Bruce hasn&#8217;t forgotten about it. If you&#8217;re lucky enough to catch it, you&#8217;ll almost certainly witness a showcase for E Street harmony&#8211;Bruce always brings the singers to the forefront and keeps the accompaniment to a minimum.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the most recent outing (and one of the finest) from SxSW 2012:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Springsteen - I Ain&#039;t Got No Home SXSW\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Kgt4Y1EIz64?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Sadly, the song has been relevant since Bruce first recorded it, and it doesn&#8217;t look like that&#8217;s about to change any time soon&#8230; so chances are good we&#8217;ll hear it again.</p>\n<p><strong>I Ain&#8217;t Got No Home</strong><br />\n<strong>Recorded:</strong> 1987-1988<br />\n<strong>Released:</strong> <em>Folkways: A Vision Shared</em> (1988)<br />\n<strong>First performed:</strong> September 23, 1988 (Oakland, CA)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> March 15, 2012 (Austin, TX)</p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
