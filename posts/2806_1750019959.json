It was half a world away from home, and Gijon isn&#8217;t exactly an international hub. If I was going to choose one show to attend for all of 2013, I would have chosen one in Italy or Sweden, where Bruce is pretty much guaranteed to put on an amazing show.</p>\n<p>But as it turned out, my company had its annual European conference scheduled in Madrid the exact week that Bruce would be playing in Gijon, and once I figured out that the two cities were a very long but very driveable-in-a-day distance apart, I knew I had to be there. With Bruce touring abroad for all of 2013, this would be my only chance to see him that year.</p>\n<p>So when my booth duty shift ended, three of my colleagues and I piled into our rental car and drove pell-mell across the Spanish countryside to the northern coast. Fortunately, concerts start late in Spain&#8211;much later than in the USA&#8211;giving us just enough time to make the drive.</p>\n<p>When we reached Gijon, I was surprised at how small it was, how economically depressed it was, and what a lovely seaside setting it enjoyed. It reminded me of Asbury Park, minus the boardwalk.</p>\n<p>We settled in for the show, not expecting anything special, just hoping for a fun evening for what I considered to be a &#8220;bonus&#8221; Wrecking Ball show for me. (Since I never expected to be there, I didn&#8217;t care what transpired&#8211;I was just grateful to catch a show, and a standard setlist would be just fine.)</p>\n<p>&#8220;Standard&#8221; went out the door by the third song, never to be heard from that evening again.</p>\n<p>Any time Bruce opens with &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/01/24/roll-of-the-dice-my-love-will-not-let-you-down/\">My Love Will Not Let You Down</a>,&#8221; you know you&#8217;re in for a fun, high-energy night&#8211;and that&#8217;s exactly what happened.

I hadn&#8217;t realized how much I&#8217;d missed that song until he started playing it.</p>\n<p>The rest of the encore was relatively standard but joyous as always. Bruce had one more surprise in store, however&#8211;after the band left the stage, he came back with an acoustic guitar and harmonica. Bruce took a few moments to acknowledge his special relationship with the town, explaining that his daughter had competed there, and that the mayor had invited him to come back and play&#8211;so here he was. Bruce also noted the hard times that had befallen the town&#8211;and Bruce has an affinity for towns fallen on hard times. So he sent us home with one final treat: an acoustic &#8220;Thunder Road.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Thunder Road (solo acoustic) - Bruce Springsteen, Gij\u00f3n 2013\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DnMmMTrXnfY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>We relived the show on the long drive home, amazed at what we had just seen.
