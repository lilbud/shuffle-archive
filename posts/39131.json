In the Name of Love&#8221; was a smash hit for The Supremes in early 1965, topping the Billboard Pop Singles chart and stopping just one spot short on the Soul chart. And even in the days long before music videos, their &#8220;talk to the hand&#8221; choreography became as identifiable with the song as its jarring cold opening and shocking (by 1965 standards, at least) content.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"The Supremes - Stop In The Name Of Love\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NPBkiBbO4_4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>It&#8217;s still one of Motown&#8217;s most recognizable singles and ranks #254 on\u00a0<em>Rolling Stone&#8217;s\u00a0</em>500 Greatest Songs of All Time and #38 on <em>Billboard&#8217;s\u00a0</em>100 Greatest Girl Group Songs of All Time.\u00a0When The Supremes were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in only its third year, it&#8217;s not surprising that &#8220;Stop! In the Name of Love&#8221; was featured in the evening&#8217;s all-star jam session.</p>\n<p>And what a jam session that was:\u00a0Mary Wilson of The Supremes was there to be inducted, as were The Drifters, The Beach Boys, and Bob Dylan. Surrounding them on stage were Neil Young, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, Mick Jagger, John Fogerty, Billy Joel, Elton John, Little Richard, Jeff Beck, Paul Simon, and many more&#8230; including Little Steven, Clarence Clemons, Max Weinberg, and Patti Scialfa.</p>\n<p>Oh, and Bruce Springsteen on the&#8230; tambourine?</p>\n<div id=\"v-SxWA7ZnT-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='568' src='https://videopress.com/embed/SxWA7ZnT?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>Yeah, I admit: it&#8217;s probably a stretch to label this a Springsteen performance, but he did play an instrument, and he even did the hand choreography (albeit at the wrong time). So I&#8217;m counting it.</p>\n<p>And yes: that&#8217;s Patti you see providing backing vocals surrounded by Jagger, Dylan, and Harrison, while Bruce looks on from far stage right. That may be in part because Bruce was accompanied that evening by his wife, Julianne, providing an ironic subtext in retrospect.</p>\n<p><strong>Stop!
