As prolific as Bruce was at the time, though, this is clearly a Steel Mill song. (For a long time, the audio above was even believed to be a Steel Mill performance.)</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s heavy, bordering on plodding (poor David Sancious is given little room to stretch) with spare lyrics that serve mostly to frame extended instrumental jams.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I wanna tell you something</em><br />\n<em>Yeah now I&#8217;m talkin&#8217; tonight on the Bible</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;m sure you all know just what it says</em><br />\n<em>Well how ya can&#8217;t do this, and ya can&#8217;t do that</em><br />\n<em>There&#8217;s no messin&#8217; round, or playin&#8217; about on Sunday</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Yeah now I got as much religion</em><br />\n<em>As any man&#8217;s got, ain&#8217;t no doubt</em><br />\n<em>But there&#8217;s a few commandments I&#8217;ve made up myself</em><br />\n<em>That the Lord don&#8217;t know nothin&#8217; about</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>That&#8217;s if you&#8217;re gonna do it</em><br />\n<em>I said do it with a feeling</em><br />\n<em>Do it till you hit the ceiling</em><br />\n<em>Do it with a feeling</em><br />\n<em>But if you&#8217;re gonna do it</em><br />\n<em>Ah, do it with a feeling</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Now once I thought I had a good woman</em><br />\n<em>But Mama much to my surprise</em><br />\n<em>She was playin&#8217; around with each and every boy in town</em><br />\n<em>Lord but she could get around some</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Ah tell me can I get a witness</em><br />\n<em>Cause I loved her just as much as I can</em><br />\n<em>Well ??? that I&#8217;m her only man</em><br />\n<em>???</em><br />\n<em>Do it with a feeling</em><br />\n<em>Do it till you&#8217;re rockin&#8217; and reeling</em><br />\n<em>Do it with a feeling</em><br />\n<em>But if you&#8217;re gonna do it</em><br />\n<em>Do it with a feeling</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Ah won&#8217;t you come with me Mama</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;m going, won&#8217;t you get on board</em><br />\n<em>My train it leaves in an hour</em><br />\n<em>You gotta pay your witness to the Lord</em></p>\n<p>If it sounds like I&#8217;m throwing shade at the Steel Mill sound, I&#8217;m not&#8211;songs like this were made for bands like that. &#8220;Do It With a Feeling&#8221; is just ill-suited to the light-on-its feet Bruce Springsteen Band.</p>\n<p>Still, it strikes a theme so Springsteenian that it&#8217;s practically his mission statement: <em>never phone it in</em>. And if you squint at that bridge, it sounds an awful like our narrator is idling his engine in front of Mary&#8217;s house, ready to pull out of there to win.</p>\n<p>Even for a Bruce Springsteen Band fan like myself, &#8220;Do It With a Feeling&#8221; is forgettable, but it demonstrates that Bruce&#8217;s early band eras weren&#8217;t as distinct as we might otherwise think.</p>\n<p><strong>Do It With a Feeling<br />\n</strong><strong>Never recorded</strong><br />\n<strong>Never released</strong><br />\n<strong>First performed:</strong> July 22, 1971 (South Amboy, NJ)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> October 23, 1971 (Richmond, VA)</p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
