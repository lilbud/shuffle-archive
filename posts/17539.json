We&#8217;ve come to accept the expendability of some of our citizens&#8217; lives and dreams as just a part of the price of doing business.&#8221; <em>&#8211;Bruce Springsteen, December 17, 1995</em></span></p></blockquote>\n<p>It was a Tuesday night in the dead of winter, and a lucky invite-only crowd packed the floor at the appropriately-named Tramps in New York City.</p>\n<p>Acclaimed film director Jonathan Demme (hot off of two Academy Award-winning films in a row) was on the scene to prep the crowd for what was about to happen, but it must have been difficult for even the die-hards to believe.</p>\n<p>It had been more than six years since the E Street Band had last played in public and over five years since Bruce had called it an era and moved on to a post-E Street career. But the band had tenuously reunited in the studio to record a few new tracks for Bruce&#8217;s upcoming <em>Greatest Hits</em> album, and Bruce had a notion to throw an intact <em>Born in the U.S.A.\u00a0</em>outtake on there as well, one that not only was a serious contender for the album back in 1982-1983 but was actually for a short time going to be the title track.</p>\n<p>Bruce felt he needed a modern video to draw attention to the 1982 studio outcast, however, and that&#8217;s where Demme and the crowd came in. That evening of February 21, 1995 was supposed to be a simple video shoot, but it turned out to be something more: a ten-song mini-concert punctuated by a half-dozen takes of the video they were there to film.</p>\n<p>While the crowd&#8217;s anticipation built to a fever pitch, Bruce and the band rehearsed backstage, so calm and assured that you&#8217;d think they&#8217;d never skipped a day.</p>\n<div id=\"v-4sXLc0yQ-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='568' src='https://videopress.com/embed/4sXLc0yQ?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>And with that, Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band launched into their first song, ushering in the Reunion era with the world debut of a song that would someday serve as a centerpiece for every single show of their comeback tour: &#8220;Murder Incorporated.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Murder Incorporated\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jj7hvKQ6Uhc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Ferocious and crunchy, &#8220;Murder Incorporated&#8221; was the perfect song to re-introduce the new, more muscular E Street Band. (Now with more guitars!)</p>\n<p>The intervening years and additional life experience served the song well, making the original 1982 outtake cum <em>Greatest Hits</em> album track seem tame by comparison.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Murder Incorporated\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oshU-C5zTWE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>The only downside from that night: the crowd&#8217;s excitement over the band&#8217;s reunion was so high and the song&#8217;s arrangement so fierce, that even though Bruce and the band played &#8220;Murder Incorporated&#8221; a full six times start-to-finish, the song&#8217;s message almost certainly went completely unnoticed.</p>\n<p>And that&#8217;s too bad, because &#8220;Murder Incorporated&#8221; was as timely in 1995 as it was in 1982 and as it still is today.</p>\n<p>Bruce and the E Street Band performed &#8220;Murder Incorporated&#8221; a couple more high-profile times that spring, and each time the focus was more on the band than on the song.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen &amp; E Street Band on Letterman, April 5, 1995\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KLtihzJ6gdw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>So when Bruce embarked on solo acoustic tour later in the year (that would stretch on for over a year-and-a-half, delaying the long-wished-for Reunion Tour), he made sure to feature &#8220;Murder Incorporated&#8221; in a setting and arrangement where its lyrical content couldn&#8217;t be ignored.</p>\n<p>Bruce played &#8220;Murder Incorporated&#8221; over fifty times solo acoustic before he ever played it in a proper concert with the E Street Band, and fortunately one of those performances is available as part of Bruce&#8217;s official archive series (get it <a href=\"http://live.brucespringsteen.net/live-music/0,17589/Bruce-Springsteen-mp3-flac-download-3-19-1996-Kings-Hall-Belfast-UK.html\">here</a>).</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Murder Incorporated (Live at King&#039;s Hall, Belfast, UK - 3/19/1996)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/UEf8P4jNB7E?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Stripped down to its mournful essence, &#8220;Murder Incorporated&#8221; reveals itself as song not of anger but of hopelessness. The song takes its name from the real-life organization of the same name&#8211;well, unofficially at least, because the real Murder, Inc. never had a true name. It was simply an enforcement organization for the mob, killing and maiming for a price.</p>\n<p>In other words: murder as a business.</p>\n<p>And certainly the song can be read literally as a tale of life in the 1930s and 1940s when Murder Incorporated ruled the streets, claiming hundreds of lives.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Bobby&#8217;s got a gun that he keeps beneath his pillow</em><br />\n<em>Out on the street your chances are zero</em><br />\n<em>Take a look around you</em><br />\n<em>It ain&#8217;t too complicated</em><br />\n<em>You&#8217;re messing with Murder Incorporated</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Now you check over your shoulder everywhere that you go</em><br />\n<em>Walking down the street, there&#8217;s eyes in every shadow</em><br />\n<em>You better take a look around you</em><br />\n<em>That equipment you got&#8217;s so outdated</em><br />\n<em>You can&#8217;t compete with Murder Incorporated</em><br />\n<em>Everywhere you look now: Murder Incorporated</em></p>\n<p>But Bruce is never one to pass up a good metaphor, so we can safely assume that &#8220;Murder Incorporated&#8221; is more than just a film noir &#8220;Jungleland.&#8221; (Plus, Bruce gave up the game when introducing the song nightly on the Ghost of Tom Joad Tour&#8211;see the pull quote at the top.)</p>\n<p>The key is right there in the second line of the song: out on the street your chances are zero.</p>\n<p>The deck is stacked against certain members of our society. The game is rigged. So if you&#8217;re playing for the losing team, your life is non-stop vigilance in order to survive it.</p>\n<p>A gun is such a potent symbol of violence that when Bruce introduces it in the first line of the song, we might assume that &#8220;Murder Incorporated&#8221; centers around gun violence. But it doesn&#8217;t&#8211;the gun is a metaphorical security blanket that&#8217;s just about as effective at protection as a literal one. Or as Bruce puts it during a bridge that builds in intensity and desperation until Bruce practically pants his way into the final verse:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>So you keep a little secret down deep inside your dresser drawer</em><br />\n<em>For dealing with the heat you&#8217;re feeling down on the killing floor</em><br />\n<em>No matter where you step you feel you&#8217;re never out of danger</em><br />\n<em>So the comfort that you keep&#8217;s a gold-plated snub-nose thirty-two</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I hear that you got a job downtown, man it leaves your head cold</em><br />\n<em>And everywhere you look life ain&#8217;t got no soul</em><br />\n<em>That apartment you live in feels like it&#8217;s just a place to hide</em><br />\n<em>When you&#8217;re walking down the street you won&#8217;t meet no one eye to eye</em><br />\n<em>Now the cops reported you as just another homicide</em><br />\n<em>I can tell that you was just frustrated</em><br />\n<em>From living with Murder Incorporated</em></p>\n<p>If there was any doubt about the message of &#8220;Murder Incorporated,&#8221; the last verse dispels it. Powerless, meaningless, nameless&#8211;just another casualty of the callousness in our society.</p>\n<p>As I prep this article for publication, I&#8217;m finishing Week Seven of sheltering in place, and I can&#8217;t help but hear &#8220;Murder Incorporated&#8221; in an entirely new context.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Out in the street your chances are zero.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>That equipment you got&#8217;s so outdated.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>No matter where you step you feel you&#8217;re never out of danger.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>That apartment you live in feels like it&#8217;s just a place to hide.</em></p>\n<p>And yet, when I turn on the TV, talking heads debate the morality of dismantling the economy for all in order to save the lives of a relative few&#8211;even though they amount to a number so high that they&#8217;re recorded as just another homicide.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s enough to make us all frustrated.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Bonus #1:</strong> No essay on &#8220;Murder Incorporated&#8221; could be complete without the spectacular\u00a0<em>Live in New York City\u00a0</em>performance. Recorded at the very end of the Reunion Tour with the E Street Band at the peak of their powers, after performing the song every single night of the tour without exception, &#8220;Murder Incorporated&#8221; is a tour de force, one of Bruce&#8217;s most exciting performances on official video.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen &amp; The E Street Band - Murder Incorporated (Live in New York City)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hJhULVsCctI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><strong>Bonus #2:\u00a0</strong>&#8220;Murder Incorporated&#8221; actually made its proper public concert debut not with the E Street Band or even solo but with Joe Grushecky and the Houserockers.
