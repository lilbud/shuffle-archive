And if that seems out of place in one of Bruce Springsteen&#8217;s darkest albums, it&#8217;s only because we haven&#8217;t looked at the address on the invitation.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Mary&#039;s Place\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q4wTGe6gtEc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;Mary&#8217;s Place&#8221; is about how we move forward in the face of loss. Our friends, family and community give us the strength to carry on, along with our faith that we&#8217;ll meet our ghosts again someday in the afterlife.</p>\n<p>The titular place exists on two planes at once: in the earthly realm, a local tavern where we gather in celebration of a life; and in heaven, where the promise of everlasting reunion is fulfilled. In the aftermath of September 11, 2001, many of us took solace in the former and held the latter close to our hearts.</p>\n<p>The verses of &#8220;Mary&#8217;s Place&#8221; operate on both levels:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I got seven pictures of Buddha, the prophet&#8217;s on my tongue</em><br />\n<em>Eleven angels of mercy sighing over that black hole in the sun</em><br />\n<em>My heart&#8217;s dark but it&#8217;s rising, I&#8217;m pulling all the faith I can see</em><br />\n<em>From that black hole on the horizon I hear your voice calling me</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Familiar faces around me, laughter fills the air</em><br />\n<em>Your loving grace surrounds me, everybody&#8217;s here</em><br />\n<em>Furniture&#8217;s out on the front porch, music&#8217;s up loud</em><br />\n<em>I dream of you in my arms and I lose myself in the crowd</em></p>\n<p>On earth, we turn to whatever religion offers us succor to help us rise above our grief and despair, and we turn to our friends and neighbors to remind us of all that is still good and joyful in the world. In heaven, all religions meet and meld and call us home when it&#8217;s our time. (There&#8217;s a reason our narrator calls it <em>Mary&#8217;s</em> place.) Our ghosts are there to greet us with the celebration that for now we can only dream about.</p>\n<p>Those are the verses. When the chorus kicks in, we realize just how subversive a song this is.\u00a0In most songs, the verses are earthbound and the chorus takes flight. The verses despair while the chorus delights.</p>\n<p>In &#8220;Mary&#8217;s Place,&#8221; Bruce inverts the formula: the verses offer us hope and support and the promise of an eventual reward, but the chorus reminds us of the merciless <em>now</em>.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Meet me at Mary&#8217;s place, we&#8217;re gonna have a party</em><br />\n<em>Tell me how do we get this thing started</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Meet me at Mary&#8217;s place, we&#8217;re gonna have a party</em><br />\n<em>Tell me how do you live brokenhearted</em></p>\n<p>Our departed loved ones may wait for us at the end of our journey, but we have miles to go before we sleep. How\u00a0<em>do</em> we get started again? How\u00a0<em>do</em> we live brokenhearted?</p>\n<p>The choruses of &#8220;Mary&#8217;s Place&#8221; remind us that we have a long workday ahead of us before the relief of that great house party in the sky.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s in the chorus, too, where Bruce overtly tips his hat to his inspirations. Bruce&#8217;s lyrics are cloaked in the thinnest of disguises. a pair of Clark Kent glasses on the chorus of Sam Cooke&#8217;s 1966 track, &#8220;Meet Me at Mary&#8217;s Place.&#8221;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Meet me at Mary&#8217;s place</em><br />\n<em>We&#8217;re gonna have us a ball today</em><br />\n<em>Why don&#8217;t you meet me at Mary&#8217;s place</em></p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Sam Cooke - Meet Me At Mary\u2019s Place (Official Lyric Video)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/415jQbRu_DE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Cooke&#8217;s song isn&#8217;t the only influence at work in &#8220;Mary&#8217;s Place.&#8221; Bruce transitions from verse to chorus with a little help from Eric Clapton and his 1972 single &#8220;Let It Rain&#8221; which has something of its own to say about the power of love to cut through grief.</p>\n<div class=\"ujudUb\" style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>The rain is falling through the mist of sorrow that surrounded me</em><br />\n<em>The sun could never thaw away the bliss that lays around me</em></div>\n<div class=\"ujudUb\" style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Let it rain, let it rain</em><br />\n<em>Let your love rain down on me</em></div>\n<div></div>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Let It Rain\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1VKpMI5Msa4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>All the while, the mighty E Streeters serve as our house party band, playing in traditional fashion and classic sound&#8211;the only track on <em>The Rising</em> that sounds (intentionally) like 1970s E Street.
