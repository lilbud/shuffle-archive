When Bruce dissolved his eponymous band, he left behind almost the entire catalog of songs he&#8217;d written and tailored to their funky, bluesy, and often brassy sound.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s almost impossible to find songs from the Bruce Springsteen Band era that crossed over to E Street, and the few that did didn&#8217;t last long. Long-time fans might be familiar with &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/01/13/roll-of-the-dice-you-mean-so-much-to-me/\">You Mean So Much to Me</a>,&#8221; which made several appearances throughout Bruce&#8217;s first two album tours. Beyond that, we&#8217;d have to scavenge set lists for the occasional one- or two-off cameos of early relics like &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/05/02/roll-of-the-dice-funk-song/\">Funk Song</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>And then there&#8217;s &#8220;Secret to the Blues.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen &amp; the E-Street Band-Secret to the Blues (live)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7cpSujTLZ9s?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Now you could argue that &#8220;Secret to the Blues&#8221; isn&#8217;t technically a crossover, as its three known performances were all in 1973. But you could also argue that it&#8217;s essentially the same song as &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/01/19/roll-of-the-dice-the-bands-just-boppin-the-blues/\">The Band&#8217;s Just Bopping the Blues,</a>&#8221; which was played twice (that we know of) by the BSB in 1971-72.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a tough call. They certainly share the same melody, arrangement, and lyrical conceit, so at the very least &#8220;Secret to the Blues&#8221; is an evolution of its predecessor in the same way &#8220;So Young and in Love&#8221; shares DNA with &#8220;A Love So Fine&#8221; and &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/06/27/roll-of-the-dice-action-in-the-streets/\">Action in the Streets</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In any event, both &#8220;Bopping&#8221; and &#8220;Secret&#8221; are essentially excuses for the as-yet-unnamed E Street Band to keep their blues muscle from atrophying. &#8220;Secret&#8221; is leaner and tighter than &#8220;Bopping,&#8221; an apt comparison for the two bands as well.</p>\n<p>Lyrically, &#8220;Secret to the Blues&#8221; has been distilled down to a handful of lines that amount to the mission statement of a blues musician with a blue-collar day job.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well now it&#8217;s a [insert day of week here] night and I&#8217;ll be sitting in my seat all alone</em><br />\n<em>And I&#8217;m feeling kind of tired from working all day, but not tired enough to go on home</em><br />\n<em>So sit back and let loose &#8217;cause that&#8217;s the secret to the blues</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Oh we got the Funky Chicken on the bass, [unintelligible nickname for Dan Federici] on the keys</em><br />\n<em>Well when Big Man plays the saxophone, them teenyboppers fall right to their knees</em><br />\n<em>So sit back and be loose, it&#8217;s the secret to the blues</em></p>\n<p>That&#8217;s &#8220;Funky&#8221; Garry Tallent Bruce is referring to, and of course we know who the Big Man is. Both &#8220;Bopping&#8221; and &#8220;Secret&#8221; served to spotlight the band members in ways that songs like &#8220;Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)&#8221; and &#8220;Kitty&#8217;s Back&#8221; would soon do.</p>\n<p>From the opening measures of &#8220;Secret to the Blues,&#8221; we can hear Bruce go to town with a deep groove that certainly stands out in his otherwise <em>Greetings</em>-heavy setlists at the time. Over the course of its almost eight minutes, we can hear elements of not just the BSB and the E Street Band, but even traces of Steel Mill in its heavier moments.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Secret to the Blues&#8221; didn&#8217;t stick around long, but in the pair of recordings known to exist, we hear Bruce and the boys captured mid-transition in a way no other song can.</p>\n<p><strong>Secret to the Blues</strong><br />\n<strong>Never Recorded</strong><br />\n<strong>Never Released</strong><br />\n<strong>First performed:</strong> January 4, 1973 (Bryn Mawr, PA)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> June 13, 1973 (Binghamton, NY)</p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
