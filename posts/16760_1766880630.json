One time only!&#8221;</p>\n<p>There may not be any words more thrilling to hear at a concert.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been lucky enough to hear Bruce Springsteen say those words from the stage more than once, but it&#8217;s been true on more than a hundred occasions, whether voiced or not.</p>\n<p>Springsteen possesses an encyclopedic appreciation for rock, soul, country, and folk classics and obscurities, and there&#8217;s no telling when he&#8217;ll debut a cover he&#8217;s never before performed on stage.</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t tempt fate by thinking, <em>he&#8217;ll never play that</em>.</p>\n<p>Steve Martin&#8217;s 1970s novelty hit, &#8220;King Tut?&#8221; Check.</p>\n<p>Frank Sinatra&#8217;s standard, &#8220;Angel Eyes?&#8221; Yup.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Achy Breaky Heart,&#8221; that 1990 earworm? You know it, and Bruce played it.</p>\n<p>The pages that follow shine a spotlight on one-time-only performances, arranged (roughly) chronologically from Bruce&#8217;s high school years to his most recent tour, and originally published on my blog <em>E Street Shuffle</em> between 2018 and 2022. (The final entry, his 2024 cover of &#8220;Ghostbusters,&#8221; is a new essay I wrote specifically for this volume.)</p>\n<p>I hope you&#8217;ll listen to the accompanying media (scan the QR codes with your phone) as you read\u2013you&#8217;ll gain a deeper appreciation for Bruce&#8217;s inspirations, his range, and his talent as an arranger and cover artist.</p>\n<p>And yes: I know some of the more obsessive among you may cry foul at some of the inclusions. There are songs here that Bruce is known to have performed on other occasions but which cannot be definitively attributed to a specific date.</p>\n<p>There are also songs he may have quoted in a medley or as a tag in one of his own songs.</p>\n<p>Some probably don&#8217;t &#8220;count&#8221; because they were only played at sound check. Some probably shouldn&#8217;t count because they were\u00a0<em>also</em> played at a sound check on a different date.</p>\n<p>How about we just agree that all of the featured songs in this book are rare covers?</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s dive in and take a time travelling road trip though music history.</p>\n<p>\u00a9 December 26, 2025</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>We now have a site index of other artists covering Bruce Springsteen&#8217;s songbook!
