That much we can all agree on. (And by \u201cwe\u201d I mean me, Ken, and Bruce Springsteen, who weighed in on the meaning of the song in his <em>Western Stars</em> feature film.)</p>\n<p>Where opinions get divided, though, is on the question of how we\u2019re supposed to feel about it. Is the song, as Springsteen suggests in the film, an admiring portrait of someone who may be past his prime but still knows who he is? Or is it something darker, more akin to \u201cGlory Days,\u201d a portrait of someone taking refuge from the present in an idealized dream of the past?</p>\n<p>Ken has already written a great <a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/03/28/roll-of-the-dice-western-stars/\">analysis of the song from the first viewpoint</a>, the optimistic one. And now he\u2019s very kindly offered me the chance to present the opposite take: \u201cWestern Stars\u201d as a day in the life of a depressed and lonely alcoholic.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Western Stars (Official Video)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_IXzAAKrsFE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Ken points out that \u201cWestern Stars\u201d has much the same beginning as \u201cDancing in the Dark.\u201d And like \u201c<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/12/25/roll-of-the-dice-dancing-in-the-dark/\">Dancing in the Dark</a>,\u201d it slips something by you. It plays with what you think you know, what you think you\u2019re hearing.</p>\n<p>The first time you hear the lyric \u201cI get up in the evening,\u201d there\u2019s a little jolt of surprise, of a clich\u00e9 being overturned. Only on a second listen do you hear the line as the literal truth: the daily grind of a character who works nights, goes to bed in the morning, gets up after dark.</p>\n<p>\u201cWestern Stars\u201d has a similarly slippery beginning. \u201cI wake up in the morning,\u201d Bruce tells us, \u201cjust glad my boots are on.\u201d And because his character doesn\u2019t see anything odd about waking up with his boots on, it\u2019s easy to miss what a weird image this is. It\u2019s easy to hear it as a metaphor for waking up in one piece, ready to greet another day. But stop a moment and think about it literally, as a character detail, and the whole song changes.</p>\n<p>In real life, who wakes up with their boots on? Someone who passed out fully clothed the night before, that\u2019s who. Who wakes up in the morning <em>glad</em> their boots are on? Someone who passes out with their boots on so often that they&#8217;ve come to think of it as normal.</p>\n<p>And with that, a part of the story snaps into focus. This is a character who wakes up hung over and spends the day getting progressively drunker, to finally pass out and do it all again the next day. And we\u2019re about to follow him through his day, find out how and why he got here. (Think of it as the Springsteen version of <em>The Hangover</em> or <em>Dude, Where\u2019s My El Camino?</em>)</p>\n<p>First stop, the set of a Viagra commercial.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>On the set, the makeup girl brings me two raw eggs and a shot of gin<br />\nThen I give it all up for that little blue pill<br />\nThat promises to bring it all back to you again.</em></p>\n<p>The long-suffering makeup girl brings our star his first drink of the day, a combined breakfast and hangover cure. And then he goes out on the set and shills for Viagra. There\u2019s some cynicism in that last line; he knows he\u2019s selling false promises &#8211; of youth, romance, second chances &#8211; along with the pills.</p>\n<p>The chorus comes in:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Ride me down easy, ride me down easy, friend<br />\nTonight the western stars are shining bright again.</em></p>\n<p>This is a patchwork chorus, assembled from the classics. The opening line comes from Billy Joe Shaver\u2019s 1973 song \u201cRide Me Down Easy,\u201d a song that envisions God as a jockey, a rider taking a horse for a gentle ride after a long and tiring race.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Waylon Jennings - Ride Me Down Easy\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7XS3IE3ktJ8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>The phrase \u201cwestern stars\u201d has a double, or even a triple meaning; the stars that hang over the American West (reminiscent of Woody Guthrie\u2019s \u201cCalifornia Stars,\u201d a painfully nostalgic late-career song, released posthumously), the vanished stars of Hollywood Westerns, and lastly, the Tennyson poem \u201cUlysses,\u201d the same portrait of Odysseus in old age that gave us the title \u201c<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/12/21/roll-of-the-dice-hungry-heart/\">Hungry Heart</a>.\u201d</p>\n<p>In other words, there is a staggering amount of Past packed into that chorus. And yet, with the strings rising gently behind it, it sounds hopeful. The singer sounds as if he expects the past to return, the western stars to resurrect themselves, as if he\u2019s just waiting for everything to come back to life.</p>\n<p>Next stop, the canyons above Sunset, where the song begins to feel cinematic. The camera pans out to show us the Hollywood of classic noir: a violent place where the veneer of civilization is thin. We watch a coyote carrying off a chihuahua: a predator with its completely outmatched prey. A similar scene plays out at the Whiskey Bar, where the narrator chats up \u201ca lost sheep from Oklahoma,\u201d &#8211; another prey animal &#8211; who is out of place enough to order a mojito and young enough to know him only as the actor from a commercial.</p>\n<p>Mellowed by whiskey and flirtation, the narrator falls into a reverie about the one part of his life that he still loves: the days when he goes rodeo riding out in the desert. Yet even here, there\u2019s an overwhelming sense of nostalgia.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>East to the desert where the charros, they still ride and rope<br />\nOur American brothers cross the wire and bring the old ways with them.</em></p>\n<p>This is another way of trying to relive the past, then: different from Viagra but just as tempting.</p>\n<p>Up till now, the musical backing has been restrained.\u00a0 But now, as the drinks and the reminiscence take effect, the orchestra surges in behind Bruce. The strings swell, swoopy and syrupy and nostalgic. The chorus returns, stronger and more triumphant than before, driving us toward the end of the night, toward whatever it is that the singer is chasing.</p>\n<p>And then we\u2019re back at the bar, and it\u2019s time for another drink. \u201cOnce I was shot by John Wayne,\u201d the singer tells us, conversationally, and we can see him turning toward us on his barstool. \u201cYeah, it was toward the end.\u201d One of several lines that ring through the song like the tolling of a bell: <em>Yeah, it was toward the end. These days there ain\u2019t no more. Bring it all back to you again. </em></p>\n<p>Now we know who the \u201cfriend\u201d of the chorus is: it\u2019s us. We\u2019re the anonymous stranger buying this man drinks while he tells his John Wayne story for the thousandth time. This is what \u201cride me down easy\u201d means; this is what the singer is asking of us.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not at home in the present, where he\u2019s a washed-up actor, an old man hawking pills and credit cards. He lives his real life in a Western movie that\u2019s playing out in his mind. But he needs a way into that movie; he needs the alcohol to cushion things; he needs an audience. The word \u201cfriend\u201d here is grimly ironic: his \u201cfriend\u201d is always a stranger, someone to whom his story is new.</p>\n<p>So we buy him drinks, and he toasts \u201cthe cowboys &#8211; riders in the whirlwind,\u201d and the strings get ever swoopier as he slides further into his dream. The line between life and the movies disappears; he\u2019s no longer just an actor; now he\u2019s also the cowboy, the hero, the guy riding up on a horse in a cloud of dust. And as he drifts away from reality and takes refuge in his mind, his mind rewards him with a last glorious vision: the riders on Sunset, \u201csmothered in the Santa Ana winds.\u201d</p>\n<p>The orchestra crashes back in, the strings swoop and soar, dramatic and stirring. He\u2019s reliving his glory days, and we\u2019re right there with him, caught up in the sudden beauty of his vision. This is what he\u2019s been chasing all day. This is what it means for the Western stars to be shining bright.</p>\n<p>But then the day ends. Our hero passes out. The music drops to almost nothing, the vision fades, and we\u2019re left back where we started.</p>\n<p><em>I woke up this morning, just glad my boots were on.</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>Introducing guest-blogger Katy Crane in her first of hopefully many appearances.
