Why? Because, his father taught him an important lesson:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I got the mysterious rhinestone thing from my father. He asked me, \u201dYou know the only way that The Lone Ranger\u00a0can go into town? I said, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d He said that he has to take his mask off. I thought, what is my dad talking about and trying to tell me? He said, \u201cWell son, you have to wear a mask and then when you don\u2019t want to be David Allan Coe you can take your mask off and go anywhere and not be like\u00a0Elvis with people messin\u2019
