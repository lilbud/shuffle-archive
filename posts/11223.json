One that would never even occur to me to ask for, but one that makes me immediately think &#8220;oooooh yeah, that&#8217;s a great choice.&#8221;</p>\n<p>One of my favorite examples is the fan who requested James Carr&#8217;s &#8220;The Dark End of the Street&#8221; in (of all places) Tampere, Finland, on June 2, 2009.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The Dark End of the Street&#8221; is (as co-songwriter Dan Penn confessed was his aspiration) &#8220;the best cheatin&#8217; song. Ever.&#8221; I&#8217;ve also always believed it to be an inspiration for Bruce&#8217;s own &#8220;Hearts of Stone.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"James Carr - The Dark End of the Street (Official Audio)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HC3AXQ8dPJM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Carr&#8217;s original 1966 recording was a hit, peaking at #10 on Billboard&#8217;s Black Singles chart, and #77 on the Pop chart.</p>\n<p>But it was Clarence Carter&#8217;s 1969 version that lodged itself in Bruce&#8217;s memory, primarily because of Carter&#8217;s spoken introduction (far longer than the song itself) that any fan who&#8217;s seen Bruce perform &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/11/10/roll-of-the-dice-back-in-your-arms/\">Back in Your Arms</a>&#8221; live will immediately recognize as an inspiration.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Clarence Carter - Making Love (At The Dark End of The Street)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/weMtz14uvAw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Bruce referenced that speech when he honored that request in Tampere, pausing mid-song to pay homage to Carter with a story of his own.</p>\n<p>Bruce acknowledged the song&#8217;s theme as one he was personally very familiar with&#8230; but not for many, many,\u00a0<em>many\u00a0</em> years.
