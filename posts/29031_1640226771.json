And in the middle of our conversation, he dropped a bombshell on me.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d asked him how Patti Scialfa&#8217;s vocal contributions to &#8220;Comin&#8217; Down Maria,&#8221; one of the album&#8217;s lovelier tracks, had come about. Obviously I knew she&#8217;d been in close proximity, since her husband was producing the album, but Bruce himself wasn&#8217;t involved with that particular track.</p>\n<p>Or so I thought. And so I&#8217;d read.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I just had that song,&#8221; Joe shrugged. &#8220;It was just Bruce and I recording it. And one of us (probably me) said, &#8216;Hey Patti, want to sit in on this?&#8217; So she came over.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mildly surprised by the &#8220;Bruce and I,&#8221; I sought to clarify that Bruce was overseeing the recording not participating in it, but Joe disabused me.</p>\n<p>\u201c[It&#8217;s] just me and Bruce. We\u2019re the only guys playing instruments&#8230; If there\u2019s drum sets, it\u2019s probably electronic drums somehow that we did, plus Patti singing.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Wait,&#8221; I said. &#8220;I did not know that. I\u2019m not sure <em>anybody\u00a0</em>knows that, actually.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Well\u2026 &#8221; Joe laughed sheepishly, &#8220;we didn\u2019t actually want to say how much he had done on the record, because he\u2019s pretty much all over it. He\u2019s on every track except &#8216;No Strings Attached&#8217; and &#8216;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/12/11/matr-joe-grushecky-and-bruce-springsteen-american-babylon/\">American Babylon</a>.&#8217; On every other song he is playing or singing or something.&#8221;</p>\n<p>So there you go: after a quarter-century of hiding in plain sight, a secret Springsteen studio performance was revealed.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Comin&#039; Down Maria\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WLshTQTt0Rg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>It&#8217;s only a little bit surprising that Bruce&#8217;s participation could remain secret for so long. A gentle love song, &#8220;Comin&#8217; Down Maria&#8221; lilts more than rocks, and whichever instrumental contributions are Bruce&#8217;s (my guess is the mandolin is among them) they betray no signature flourishes.</p>\n<p>Patti&#8217;s vocals, however, are unmistakable. Even if she&#8217;d gone uncredited, we&#8217;d instantly recognize her, and her contributions polish what was already a terrific track to a beautiful shine.</p>\n<p>Sadly, Bruce and Joe have never performed &#8220;Comin&#8217; Down Maria&#8221; together, either with or without Patti. As lovely as the song is, it&#8217;s probably too gentle for Joe&#8217;s rocking full-band sets where Bruce is known to make surprise appearances.</p>\n<p>But as a studio track, it&#8217;s an underappreciated jewel.</p>\n<div class=\"su-box su-box-style-default\" id=\"\" style=\"border-color:#000000;border-radius:3px;\"><div class=\"su-box-title\" style=\"background-color:#333333;color:#FFFFFF;border-top-left-radius:1px;border-top-right-radius:1px\">Bloggers' Note</div><div class=\"su-box-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim\" style=\"border-bottom-left-radius:1px;border-bottom-right-radius:1px\">\n<p><em>American Babylon\u00a0</em>returns to print this fall as a deluxe two-disc anniversary re-issue, complete with bonus demos and vintage live performances with Bruce from their famous October Assault 1995 mini-tour.
