Needless to say, the field is wide open.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\">&#8212; <em>Bruce Springsteen introducing &#8220;Red Headed Woman,&#8221; September 25, 1996</em></span></p></blockquote>\n<p>Ladies and gentlemen, the comedy stylings of Mr. Bruce Springsteen:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&#8220;If you can pronounce it, you can probably do it. &#8216;Cunnilingus!&#8217; See? You&#8217;re ready!&#8221;</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&#8220;I got a lot of theories about cunnilingus. I got a political theory, which is that if Bob Dole hadn&#8217;t pushed that 15 percent tax cut and instead promoted cunnilingus in place of it, he might be president right now. So my theory is that&#8217;s how Bill Clinton got elected: he&#8217;s the only candidate people could actually imagine practicing cunnilingus!&#8221;</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&#8220;I do mean practicing though, because it&#8217;s not as easy as it looks. It takes a lot of practice, a lot of attention and craft and detail, it takes a lot of patience, patience, and more patience.&#8221;\u00a0</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&#8220;The upside is you score a lot of big points with the missus. Next time you do something stupid, you can always stand back and say &#8216;Darling, remember that lovely evening when we practiced cunnilingus?&#8217; And she&#8217;ll say &#8216;If you think that makes a difference&#8230; actually that was pretty nice, let&#8217;s do that again.'&#8221;</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&#8220;If there\u00b4s any children left in the auditorium, \u00b4cunnilingus\u00b4 is Latin for &#8216;Keep your room very clean&#8217;.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&#8220;It&#8217;s a metaphor for true love, just a metaphor!&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>This may be the only time I ever compare Bruce Springteen to ALF, but I have to believe that every time Bruce performs &#8220;Red Headed Woman&#8221; (and at least when he talks about it) he&#8217;s gotta be thinking, &#8220;I kill me!&#8221; Depending on your predisposition, there&#8217;s very little more endearing or eye roll-inducing than watching Bruce Springsteen crack himself up on stage.</p>\n<p>But hey, I&#8217;m grateful he put it all out there. He&#8217;s saved me (and you) from my otherwise irresistible temptation to go for the easy jokes. Or the bad ones. I usually can&#8217;t tell the difference.</p>\n<p>Anyway, &#8220;Red Headed Woman&#8221; made its debut at Bruce&#8217;s legendary Christic acoustic shows in November 1990. It was Bruce&#8217;s first public concert appearance since mothballing the E Street Band the year prior, and while I can&#8217;t say for sure what the audience was expecting that night, I&#8217;m fairly certain it wasn&#8217;t a yodeling Springsteen waxing poetic about oral sex.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Red Headed Woman - Bruce Springsteen (16-11-1990 Shrine Auditorium, Los Angeles, California)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TFhsQ82ONZo?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Now if it was just that pair of off-tour performances, &#8220;Red Headed Woman&#8221; might have stayed an under-the-radar lark. But in one of the more famous episodes of <em>MTV Unplugged</em>, Bruce chose to <em>open the show</em> with it before plugging in immediately after and abandoning the entire point of the series.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Red Headed Woman (from In Concert/MTV Plugged)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-5c-tGH-J4M?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;Red Headed Woman&#8221; was canon from that point on.</p>\n<p>So what possessed Bruce to focus his songwriting talents in that particular direction? All I can offer is a little historical context. If Bruce debuted &#8220;Red Headed Woman&#8221; in November 1990, he likely wrote it shortly before&#8211;perhaps shortly after the birth of the eldest Springsteen child over the summer.\u00a0One might assume that marital relations had resumed in the Springsteen/Scialfa household, and all was right with the world.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well brunettes are fine man</em><br />\n<em>And blondes are fun</em><br />\n<em>But when it comes to getting the dirty job done</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;ll take a red headed woman</em><br />\n<em>A red headed woman</em><br />\n<em>Yeah a red headed woman</em><br />\n<em>Sure can get that job done</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well listen up stud</em><br />\n<em>Your life&#8217;s been wasted</em><br />\n<em>&#8216;Til you&#8217;ve been down on your knees on and tasted</em><br />\n<em>A red headed woman</em><br />\n<em>A red headed woman</em><br />\n<em>Yeah a red headed woman</em><br />\n<em>Sure gets a dirty job done</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Yeah well tight skirt, strawberry hair</em><br />\n<em>Tell me what you&#8217;ve got baby, waiting under there</em><br />\n<em>Big green eyes that look like sun</em><br />\n<em>They can see every cheap thing that you ever done</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well I don&#8217;t care how many girls you&#8217;ve dated</em><br />\n<em>You ain&#8217;t lived till you&#8217;ve had your tires rotated<br />\n</em><em>By a red headed woman</em><br />\n<em>A red headed woman</em><br />\n<em>A red headed woman</em><br />\n<em>Sure can get the job done</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well now all you girls out there tonight sure look fine</em><br />\n<em>But my heart and soul and this body of mine</em><br />\n<em>Is a red headed woman&#8217;s</em><br />\n<em>Belongs to a red headed woman</em><br />\n<em>Yeah a red headed woman</em><br />\n<em>Sure gets the dirty job done</em></p>\n<p>Now, if you&#8217;re expecting my usual deep song analysis, I will sadly disappoint today&#8211;not because I&#8217;m a prude, but rather because there no depths to plumb here. &#8220;Red Headed Woman&#8221; is about exactly what Bruce has always proclaimed it to be about, and that&#8217;s all there really is to say about it.</p>\n<p>Well, okay, except for this: it&#8217;s not\u00a0<em>entirely\u00a0</em>about cunnilingus. There&#8217;s a whole verse about fellatio, too.</p>\n<p>Like, seriously: there are only two verses that focus on oral sex, and each lover gets equal time. Yet every written reference I&#8217;ve ever seen to the song calls it a cunnilingus song. What&#8217;s up with that?</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s true that in later years, Bruce added a verse to tilt the song a little more toward his partner, but even so&#8230;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Well push come to shove</em><br />\n<em>And shove come to push</em><br />\n<em>I was Moses kneeling for the burning bush</em><br />\n<em>Of a red headed woman</em></p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Springsteen - Red Headed Woman (Clip from Springsteen &amp; I) ....

At his Reunion Tour show in Washington D.C., Bruce invited Bonnie to join the E Street Band on stage for a rousing encore of his ode to redheads.</p>\n<p>Oh, and not just Bonnie, but also\u00a0 Bruce Hornsby, Mary Chapin Carpenter, Shawn Colvin, and Jackson Browne&#8211;certainly one of the more unusual guest appearances on an E Street stage.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Red Headed Woman [Washington September 3, 1999]\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/34cYMiXkFOE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><strong>Red Headed Woman<br />\nRecorded:</strong> Late 1990<br />\n<strong>Never released</strong><br />\n<strong>Frist performed:</strong> November 16, 1990 (Los Angeles, CA)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> March 26, 2013 (Melbourne, Australia)</p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
