But life has a habit of getting in the way, and despite writing and producing her 1992 holiday song, &#8220;All Alone on Christmas,&#8221; Steve never quite got around to recording that album with her.</p>\n<p>Until 2014, that is, when something stirred Steve into action. Calling in favors with friends like Elvis Costello, Joan Jett, and of course Bruce, Steve collected a group of songs that he arranged into a comeback album called (ironically)\u00a0<em>Introducing Darlene Love</em>.</p>\n<p>Bruce contributed two original songs to the project, one of which is the\u00a0<em>very</em> Spectorish &#8220;Night Closing In.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Night closing in - Darlene Love  (Composed by Bruce Springsteen)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tCBC4IV8GdM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;Night Closing In&#8221; is a song of heartbreak. It&#8217;s about those first few days after a break-up, when you wake up in the morning and all seems right&#8230; until you remember.</p>\n<p>The day provides its distractions, but the clock counts down to the night&#8211;and the night brings it all back home in a steamy final verse.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>The morning light greets me when I wake</em><br />\n<em>And for just one moment I forget my heartache</em><br />\n<em>And the lonely lonely hours start wearing me thin</em><br />\n<em>Baby I can feel the night</em><br />\n<em>Baby I can feel the night</em><br />\n<em>Baby I can feel the night, closing in</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Get out of bed, put on my stockings and my skirt</em><br />\n<em>Day by day and step by step I make it through work</em><br />\n<em>Then there&#8217;s the sun, sinks down, that&#8217;s when the blues began</em><br />\n<em>Baby I can feel the night</em><br />\n<em>And baby I can feel the night</em><br />\n<em>Baby I can feel the night, closing in</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>And into bed, naked under the sheets</em><br />\n<em>I try not to think about you but I can feel the heat</em><br />\n<em>And in the midnight hour, that&#8217;s when the blues began</em><br />\n<em>And baby I can feel the night</em><br />\n<em>Baby I can feel the night</em><br />\n<em>Baby I can feel the night, closing in</em></p>\n<p>We don&#8217;t know exactly when Bruce wrote &#8220;Night Closing In,&#8221; or whether he&#8217;s ever recorded it for himself (the song certainly seems written for a woman to sing, but Bruce has recorded songs from a female point of view before), but I can&#8217;t help but notice the musical similarity to &#8220;Loose Ends&#8221; in the opening sax solo, bridge, and coda.</p>\n<p>I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if the song dates much farther back than 2014.\u00a0But that&#8217;s okay&#8211;with a performance and production like this one, we don&#8217;t need Bruce to release his own version.</p>\n<p>This one is perfect as is.</p>\n<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> Here&#8217;s Darlene&#8217;s live performance of &#8220;Night Closing In&#8221; (with Little Steven) from shortly after her record release in 2015.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Darlene Love Night Closing In 2015\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/N-5FXMhnKMg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><strong>Night Closing In<br />\nRecorded:</strong> 2014-2015<br />\n<strong>Released:\u00a0</strong><em>Introducing Darlene Love</em> (2015)<br />\n<strong>Never performed live by Bruce</strong></p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>When Steve Van Zandt produced a comeback album for Darlene Love, Bruce contributed an original song that&#8217;s both unmistakably Springsteenian and custom-tailored for Love.
