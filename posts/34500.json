I took a long vacation; my dad died; my granddaughter was born; live music returned; work got busier than ever; new friendships blossomed.</p>\n<p>And as a result, my posting schedule got a bit unpredictable, and occasional skip days and weeks crept onto the calendar. No one complained of course&#8211;I don&#8217;t pretend to think that this site affects anyone&#8217;s day that much one way or the other&#8211;but I like being dependable, so it bothered me.</p>\n<p>So some weeks back, I made the decision to put this site on half-time status&#8230; sort of. This means:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/category/kingdom-of-days/\"><em>Kingdom of Days</em></a> still runs daily, without interruption.</li>\n<li><em><a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/category/roll-of-the-dice/\">Roll of the Dice,</a> <a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/category/cover-me/\">Cover Me</a>, <a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/category/meeting-across-the-river/\">Meeting Across the River</a>,</em> and <a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/category/spare-parts/\"><em>Spare Parts</em></a> all share an &#8220;every other day&#8221; posting schedule&#8211;three or four posts a week in total.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This schedule change gives me a lot of time back in my week, and (so far, at least) enables me to keep a regular cadence going.</p>\n<p>It also adds a couple of other benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I now have time to add new video to <em>Kingdom of Days</em> posts that can&#8217;t be found on YouTube (see <a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/05/07/kingdom-of-days-may-7/\">today&#8217;s post</a> for two examples).</li>\n<li>New posts will continue at least into 2023, maybe longer if Bruce releases or covers new music during that time. (Originally, I&#8217;d planned to wrap up the site this year.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One thing&#8217;s certain: I have no intention of stopping until we make it through every song&#8211;and there&#8217;s still about 200 left to go.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading this far, this long, and this regularly. I hope life is full for you too, and that we all have the chance to be together at a show someday soon!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>A little note to explain
