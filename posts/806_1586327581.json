But it took until 1991 for them to record their first and only collaboration.</p>\n<p>Bruce&#8217;s participation was assured from the outset: bumping in to each other at a southern California Italian restaurant on the first day of recording sessions for John&#8217;s <em>The Missing Years</em> album, Bruce gave John his phone number and told him, &#8220;When you guys get into the record and have something to play, please invite me over. I&#8217;d just love to play guitar or harmonica or sing or whatever.&#8221;</p>\n<p>John took Bruce up on his offer, and Bruce contributed his harmony vocals to &#8220;Take a Look at My Hear,&#8221; a wry and bitter rocker co-written by John Prine and John Mellencamp.
