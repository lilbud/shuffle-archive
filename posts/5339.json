It&#8217;s not as if Bruce hasn&#8217;t written from the female perspective before: &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/05/16/roll-of-the-dice-devils-arcade/\">Devil&#8217;s Arcade</a>&#8221; is unmistakably sung in the voice of a woman, as is &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/01/04/roll-of-the-dice-car-wash/\">Car Wash</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I suspect it&#8217;s the outright romantic nature of the song that makes some fans uncomfortable with it, as well as the explicit title.</p>\n<p>I think the more interesting question is: what made him write about the subject matter from\u00a0<em>any\u00a0</em>perspective. And if there&#8217;s controversy to be found, it&#8217;s in the debate over the wisdom of a character who shrugs off their partner&#8217;s infidelity and chalks it up to &#8220;hey, men are just like that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If Bruce gives us any clue at all as to his motivation for the song, it&#8217;s probably found not in the lyrics but rather the music. Take a listen:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"My Lover Man (Studio Outtake - 1990)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/n-jzr3jSDX0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Sound familiar?

Listen for yourself:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Brilliant Disguise (Official Video)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/idnJnjV_8rg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>We don&#8217;t know exactly when Bruce wrote &#8220;My Lover Man,&#8221; but we do know that he recorded it in late 1990, three years after the release of <em><a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/08/08/album-companion-tunnel-of-love/\">Tunnel of Love</a>,\u00a0</em>which featured &#8220;Brilliant Disguise&#8221; as a centerpiece of an album about troubled relationships. That was Bruce&#8217;s last album before recording &#8220;My Lover Man,&#8221; and it doesn&#8217;t seem a stretch to wonder if those songs were still top of mind for him.</p>\n<p>Bruce had also been going to therapy (as he disclosed and discussed publicly mere weeks before recording &#8220;My Lover Man&#8221;) and had recently become a father, and over the next year-and-a-half he would re-marry and generate an album&#8217;s worth of new material that seemed lighter, more self-accepting and self-forgiving than anything he&#8217;d written previously.</p>\n<p>&#8220;My Lover Man&#8221; may simply have been a songwriting exercise, but it may also have been one of Bruce&#8217;s early attempts to come to terms with transgression, betrayal, and forgiveness&#8211;whether it&#8217;s to be taken literally or metaphorically may be beside the point.</p>\n<p>But the point itself warrants discussion.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>You treated me hard and made my heart ache</em><br />\n<em>I know you&#8217;re only human, and men they make mistakes</em><br />\n<em>Your life with her turned to black</em><br />\n<em>And now you want our love back</em><br />\n<em>Well come into my arms and fall</em><br />\n<em>My lover man</em></p>\n<p>Like I wrote earlier, that&#8217;s a <i>very\u00a0</i>blas\u00e9 take on infidelity. Here&#8217;s a woman who has been abandoned by her man. (And yes, I think we can safely assume the point-of-view character is a woman rather than a gay man, since the &#8220;other woman&#8221; is explicitly stated to be another woman (Let&#8217;s not argue about whether the Lover Man is bisexual; that would be overly specific.)) He ran off with another woman, and when that didn&#8217;t work out so well, he asked to be taken back.</p>\n<p>So what does our heroine do? She welcomes him back with open arms. Boys will be boys, after all.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Was it a gypsy&#8217;s curse or a hex sign</em><br />\n<em>Or was it just that simple thing that led you from these arms of mine</em><br />\n<em>Oh yes I&#8217;ve had the days</em><br />\n<em>To grow used to your foolish ways</em><br />\n<em>And what is it really after all</em><br />\n<em>My lover man</em></p>\n<p>Did he fall under a nefarious spell? Nah, it was just sex, &#8220;that simple thing.&#8221; But hey, she&#8217;s used to it, c&#8217;mon home.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>I can see the change in your eyes</em><br />\n<em>There&#8217;s no need to apologize</em><br />\n<em>We stood at the wishing well</em><br />\n<em>Our dreams like coins into the water fell</em><br />\n<em>The water so cold and black</em><br />\n<em>There was no going back</em></p>\n<p>With this verse, we&#8217;re not just in similar musical territory as &#8220;Brilliant Disguise&#8217; &#8212; we&#8217;re now mirroring its lyrics as well, standing at the wishing well instead of the altar. And when she looks in his eyes, oh yeah, that&#8217;s him, baby. If he&#8217;s in disguise, it must be pretty dang brilliant, because she buys it completely.</p>\n<p>She apparently also hold herself at least partly accountable for their circumstances:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>I don&#8217;t mean to cause you hurt or cause you pain</em><br />\n<em>Life is short and love&#8217;s a dirty game</em><br />\n<em>Now there&#8217;s no need for our game to end</em><br />\n<em>Come close and we&#8217;ll begin</em><br />\n<em>To find our beautiful selves again</em><br />\n<em>My lover man</em></p>\n<p>Now, I realize I may be coming across as judgmental. I&#8217;m really not. Any relationship is complicated, and no one outside of it has any basis to judge those within it. I&#8217;m surprised only by the lightness with which the protagonist treats the matter, not by her decision, actions, or outcome.</p>\n<p>But if you&#8217;re tempted to judge anyway&#8211;whether the character or the songwriter&#8211;consider this:</p>\n<p>This is a woman who harbors absolutely zero doubt about what she&#8217;s sure of.</p>\n<p>And for a songwriter just emerging from a period of intense doubt, that has to be the very definition of a state of grace.</p>\n<p>And who wouldn&#8217;t envy that?</p>\n<p><strong>My Lover Man</strong><strong><br />\nRecorded:</strong>\u00a0December 4, 1990<br />\n<strong>Released:\u00a0</strong><em>Tracks (1998)</em><strong><br />\nNever</strong> <strong>performed</strong></p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
