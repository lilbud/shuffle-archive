But that&#8217;s exactly what happened more than 35 years ago with Bette Midler and &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/08/21/roll-of-the-dice-pink-cadillac/\">Pink Cadillac</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/01/28/cover-me-bette-midler-the-e-street-shuffle/\">No stranger to covering Bruce</a>, Midler loved the song and recorded it for her 1983\u00a0<em>No Frills\u00a0</em>album. But after it was already recorded and ready for release, Bruce legally stopped her from doing so.</p>\n<p>While the story is always told from Midler&#8217;s perspective (Bruce has never made a public comment about it), Bruce allegedly protested that the song was inappropriate for a female singer.</p>\n<p><strong>(Updated August 17, 2019:\u00a0</strong>In his book <em>The Stories Behind the Songs</em>, Brian Hiatt finally provides insight into why Bruce declined to let Midler release her version. Apparently when Bruce heard it, he remarked, &#8220;I mean, it&#8217;s just in your face.&#8221; I&#8217;ll just leave that there without comment.)</p>\n<p>Now, it&#8217;s true that &#8220;Pink Cadillac&#8221; is a song-length sexual metaphor, but certainly men don&#8217;t have a monopoly on fascination with it. Chalk it up to a less enlightened time and a less enlightened Bruce, I guess.</p>\n<p>To this day Bette&#8217;s studio cover has never been released (she replaced the album track with &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/03/19/matr-bruce-springsteen-and-alejandro-escovedo-beast-of-burden/\">Beast of Burden</a>&#8220;), but you can still hear&#8211;and see&#8211;her cover arrangement: by the time she recorded it in the studio, Midler had already performed &#8220;Pink Cadillac&#8221; on her previous tour. In 1984, she released a home video of one of those shows, and the opening number was none other than&#8230; &#8220;Pink Cadillac.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Enjoy the Springsteen cover that never was:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Pink Cadillac   Cadillac Walk - Art Or Bust -1982 - Bette Midler\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9typ8Q5YLFc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>The Bruce cover that never was: Bette Midler recorded her version of &#8220;Pink Cadillac,&#8221; but Bruce refused to let her release it.
