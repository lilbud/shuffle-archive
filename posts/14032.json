Entitled\u00a0<em>Every Child Deserves a Lifetime</em>, profits from the album sales benefited the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation.</p>\n<p>The line-up was pretty amazing: the Disney-released CD (which you can still find <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Every-Child-Deserves-Lifetime-Children/dp/B000VBIEY2/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=for+our+children&amp;qid=1573422062&amp;sr=8-1\">available for sale</a> today) includes contributions from Bob Dylan, Paul McCartney, Elton John, Barbara Streisand, Sting, Jackson Browne, Ann and Nancy Wilson, James Taylor, and more.</p>\n<p>And of course, it includes a track from Bruce Springsteen.</p>\n<p>When Bruce was asked to contribute in the summer of 1990, he had just become a brand-new parent. Evan was only an infant, and Bruce had already been singing &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/03/01/roll-of-the-dice-cover-me-pony-boy/\">Pony Boy</a>&#8221; to him since before he was born.</p>\n<p>Bruce was seriously tempted to contribute &#8220;Pony Boy&#8221; to the Disney collection, but as we now know, he decided to save that one for his next album. Instead, he chose another song in heavy rotation in the Springsteen house: Nancy Cassidy&#8217;s &#8220;Chicken Lips and Lizard Hips.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Chicken Lips and Lizard Hips\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GiQj5c2H3K4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;Chicken Lips and Lizard Hips&#8221; is a playful song, a tale of good-natured, childish rebellion mollified by a sly parental trick.
