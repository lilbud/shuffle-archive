Along with &#8220;Private Number&#8221; (which I dearly hope is among the forty other songs Bruce Springsteen recorded but rejected for his latest album), Bell&#8217;s deeply soulful &#8220;I Forgot to Be Your Lover&#8221; sits atop my all-time favorite Stax singles list.</p>\n<p>When I noticed its inclusion on <em>Only the Strong Survive</em>, I was both delighted and trepidatious. When it comes to covering other artists, Bruce consistently delivers. Every tune he touches benefits from either an inventive new arrangement or a delivery powerful enough to make you forget the original.</p>\n<p>In this case, though, the original is unforgettable.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"I Forgot To Be Your Lover\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DcyERDIGXsA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;I Forgot to Be Your Lover&#8221; gave Bell his first Top Ten R&amp;B hit in 1968, seven years into his recording career. It would be even longer before he had another, although his 1969 non-charting &#8220;Born Under a Bad Sign&#8221; (co-written with fellow Stax legend Booker T. Jones) would go on to become a blues classic.</p>\n<p>Bell and Booker T. were the songwriting team behind &#8220;I Forgot To Be Your Lover,&#8221; too. Its doleful backing track (featuring an uncredited Jones on electric guitar) pairs perfectly with Bell&#8217;s rueful vocals. It&#8217;s his finest performance on record, in my opinion, and if you listen closely you can hear the seeds of &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/11/10/roll-of-the-dice-back-in-your-arms/\">Back in Your Arms</a>&#8221; in both content and delivery.</p>\n<p>And therein lies the rub: some songs are so definitive that it&#8217;s almost impossible to make them your own&#8211;at least not without taking them in a very different direction. That&#8217;s exactly what Lee &#8220;Scratch&#8221; Perry did when he covered &#8220;I Forgot to Be Your Lover&#8221; in a reggae arrangement in 1971&#8230;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Lover Version\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qNy-FzVN3XI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8230;or The Mad Lads in their 1973 arrangement that&#8230; well, it defies description.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"The Mad Lads - I Forgot To Be Your Lover\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dZahhw4M7hY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>The most commercially successful version of &#8220;I Forgot to Be Your Lover&#8221; is also the most artistically daring: Billy Idol&#8217;s 1986 rockabilly-dance version (with a truncated &#8220;To Be a Lover&#8221; title) that peaked at #6 on the Billboard Hot 100.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Billy Idol - To Be A Lover (Official Music Video)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_L9epO3tJT4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Which direction did Bruce take Bell&#8217;s song? As it turns out, no direction at all. Bruce&#8217;s version on <em>Only the Strong Survive</em> hews&nbsp;<em>very</em> closely to the original, matching it in length, style and delivery from its note-for-note recreation of the introduction.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - I Forgot To Be Your Lover (Official Audio)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zan5lbpglSI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Bruce&#8217;s version of &#8220;I Forgot to Be Your Lover&#8221; is so close to Bell&#8217;s original that I can only assume he welcomes if not downright invites comparison.</p>\n<p>So how does Bruce&#8217;s cover compare to the original? Pretty well, actually.</p>\n<p>Musically, it falls a bit short, losing some of the loneliness of the original backing track due to some questionable orchestration decisions. (Ron Aniello&#8217;s glockenspiel is particularly misplaced, brightening a song that has no business being brightened.)</p>\n<p>Vocally, though, Springsteen easily matches Bell&#8217;s impassioned delivery, producing some of the album&#8217;s most thrilling moments (0:56, for example). It certainly doesn&#8217;t hurt that he&#8217;s supported by Stax royalty Sam Moore&#8217;s backing vocals.</p>\n<p>If anything, Bruce goes a bit&nbsp;<em>too</em> far on the passion front. Bell&#8217;s original is warm, soothing, even seductive&#8211;as if he&#8217;s proving to his off-screen love interest that he may have forgotten to be her lover, but he didn&#8217;t forget&nbsp;<em>how</em> to be one. Bruce&#8217;s version, by contrast, is pure anguish verging on self-flagellation. That&#8217;s not a criticism, but it makes the song land very differently on the listener&#8217;s ears.</p>\n<p>One can easily imagine Bruce tackling &#8220;I Forgot to Be Your Lover&#8221; in full soul shout mode in concert complete with mid-song patter.&nbsp;In fact, I&#8217;m surprised he didn&#8217;t go there on the album. At only two-and-a-half minutes, Bruce certainly had room to let the song breathe without breaking the arrangement, like Melissa Etheridge did so adeptly in her 2016 cover.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"I Forgot To Be Your Lover\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/y4rPjggHcts?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Still, these are quibbles that only surface during comparisons. Taken at its own merits, Bruce&#8217;s version of &#8220;I Forgot to Be Your Lover&#8221; qualifies as one of his best vocal performances and a fine homage to a Stax classic.</p>\n<p><strong>I Forgot to Be Your Lover<br />\nRecorded:</strong> 2021<br />\n<strong>Released:</strong>&nbsp;<em>Only the Strong Survive&nbsp;</em>(2022)<br />\n<strong>Never performed</strong></p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
