Throughout Bruce&#8217;s sophomore Asbury Park holiday show stand in 2001, Patti performed it each night, with her husband and the Max Weinberg 7 providing their instrumental support. Here&#8217;s her debut performance:</p>\n<div id=\"v-hAJymwks-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='568'

brief promotional tour for <em>23rd Street Lullaby</em>.</p>\n<p>At The Hit Factory in New York City on the evening of April 18, 2004, Patti was backed by her studio musicians plus Nils, Soozie, cellist Jane Scaprantoni (who plays on several tracks on <em>The Rising</em>), Mark Stewart, and amazing backing vocalists Lisa Fischer and Robin Clark (you know both of their work even if you don&#8217;t think you do).</p>\n<p>Oh, and her husband was there, too.</p>\n<p>Start your Valentine&#8217;s Day with this wonderfully filmed, beautifully performed, but rarely seen version of
