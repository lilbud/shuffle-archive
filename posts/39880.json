Club</em> in 2011, &#8220;laughed at by the new thinking, saying to these new smarty-pants types: &#8216;Look, you think you got it all going on. You can laugh at me, but all I&#8217;m saying is what&#8217;s so funny about peace, love, and understanding?'&#8221;</p>\n<p>But as he started to write it, the song&#8217;s refrain struck him as too important to laugh off. &#8220;Something told me there was a little grain of wisdom in this thing,&#8221; he said in the same interview, &#8220;and not to mess it up.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He didn&#8217;t.</p>\n<p>Lowe played it straight and earnest when he recorded &#8220;(What&#8217;s So Funny &#8216;Bout) Peace, Love and Understanding&#8221; with his band Brinsley Schwarz in early 1974. Although subsequent covers would prove more popular, Lowe&#8217;s original version remains (IMHO) the definitive version of the song.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Nick Lowe - &quot;(What&#039;s So Funny &#039;Bout) Peace Love And Understanding&quot; (Official Audio)\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/N3r-TuIcK2k?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>That original version never charted, but it won over at least one notable Brinsley Schwarz fan: a young Elvis Costello, who loved the song every time he heard the band play it live.</p>\n<p>After Brinsley Schwarz went their separate ways, Lowe went solo as a recording artist and produced Costello&#8217;s first five studio LPs. Elvis&#8217; albums contained only self-written material, but he couldn&#8217;t abide letting &#8220;Peace, Love and Understanding&#8221; waste away in obscurity. He asked Lowe if he could take a crack at it, and Lowe not only obliged but produced the track.</p>\n<p>Costello&#8217;s version is faster and more aggressive, less jangly but just as earnest. Neither Lowe nor Costello ever expected it to become a hit, which is why Costello released it as a B-side&#8230; and not even his own. Elvis Costello and The Attractions released their version of &#8220;Peace, Love and Understanding&#8221; as the B-side of Lowe&#8217;s 1978 single, &#8220;American Squirm,&#8221; and credited themselves on the label as &#8220;Nick Lowe and His Sound.&#8221;</p>\n<p>When Costello&#8217;s version quickly became a hit, he appended it to his third album, <em>Armed Forces</em>, where it was discovered by American fans. It gained even wider exposure when Costello released an early music video on U.K. television in 1979.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Elvis Costello &amp; The Attractions - (What&#039;s So Funny &#039;Bout) Peace, Love And Understanding\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ssd3U_zicAI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Costello&#8217;s version rescued &#8220;Peace, Love and Understanding&#8221; from obscurity. In the more than four decades since, it&#8217;s been covered by countless artists. Big Head Todd and the Monsters, Midnight Oil, Sharon Van Etten, Sheryl Crow, Natalie Merchant, Curtis Stigers, Chris Cornell, The Wallflowers, Keb&#8217; Mo&#8217;, Steve Earle, and Simple Minds all put their own stamp on Lowe&#8217;s anthem at one time or another.</p>\n<p>And then of course, there&#8217;s Bruce Springsteen.</p>\n<p>Springsteen first performed &#8220;(What&#8217;s So Funny &#8216;Bout) Peace, Love and Understanding&#8221; as an encore during his Asbury Park holiday shows in 2003, where he was joined at the mic one evening by Jon Bon Jovi.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen, Jon Bon Jovi &amp; Friends - (What&#039;s So Funny &#039;Bout) Peace, Love, and Understanding\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9QSZsvxHxV8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Lowe&#8217;s song was still on Bruce&#8217;s mind ten months later when he was recruited as a headliner for the ill-fated Vote for Change Tour. Each night of the tour, &#8220;Peace, Love and Understanding&#8221; reprised its role as the evening&#8217;s penultimate number, and each night Bruce was joined at the mic by his co-starring artists.</p>\n<p>John Fogerty was on stage for every performance, and R.E.M. and Conor Oberst on most nights. The Chicks (still known as Dixie), Jackson Browne, and Eddie Vedder joined in a couple of times. Neil Young and Tracy Chapman each made a single guest appearance.</p>\n<p>But it was the televised tour finale that set the high-watermark, when Springsteen, Fogerty, Vedder, Browne, R.E.M. and The Chicks were joined by John Mellencamp, Bonnie Raitt, Dave Matthews, Kenneth &#8220;Babyface&#8221; Edmonds, Keb&#8217; Mo&#8217;, James Taylor, and Jurassic 5 for a team-up to end all team-ups.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen: What&#039;s so funny &#039;bout peace, love &amp; understanding\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/szAMOyTe1IY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;Peace, Love and Understanding&#8221; was an apt clarion call for a concert aimed at galvanizing eligible voters. As civic activism, the tour was a failure&#8211;but that only made the song&#8217;s inclusion all the more important. Bruce would perform it only twice more (in a pair of post-election holiday shows), but the song&#8217;s theme would inform Bruce&#8217;s message the next time he took the E Street Band on the road.</p>\n<p>And that time, Americans would vote for change.</p>\n<p><strong>(What&#8217;s So Funny &#8216;Bout) Peace, Love and Understanding<br />\nFirst performed:</strong> December 5, 2003
