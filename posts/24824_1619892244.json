In 1936, American country singer-songwriter Rex Griffin recorded his own original song by the same name, and it doesn&#8217;t require a very close listen to realize the similarities go far beyond the title.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Rex Griffin - Everybody&#039;s Trying To Be My Baby\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bHOK0YSjBU0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Did Perkins unjustly claim writing credit for &#8220;Everybody&#8217;s Trying to Be My Baby?&#8221;</p>\n<p>An argument can be made that Perkins simply adapted the song; most of Perkins&#8217; verses are new and his theme is much lighter. (Griffin&#8217;s original lyrics are almost country blues.)</p>\n<p>Personally, I don&#8217;t buy that argument. Griffin and his estate never received any royalties for Perkins&#8217; cover or The Beatles&#8217; cover of a cover, nor is he generally credited for the melody that inspired such classics as &#8220;Rock Around the Clock&#8221; and &#8220;Move It On Over.&#8221; And that strikes me as artistic injustice.</p>\n<p>Griffin&#8217;s original remains an obscurity, but Perkins&#8217; adaptation continues to surface from time to time&#8211;in Steve Earle&#8217;s set lists for example, where &#8220;Everybody&#8217;s Trying to Be My Baby&#8221; made a few appearances in 1998.</p>\n<p>Bruce Springsteen was a guest at one of those appearances, and when he joined Earle on stage the first song they performed together was &#8220;Everybody&#8217;s Trying to Be My Baby,&#8221; with Bruce on backing vocals for much of the song but taking the lead on the final verse.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Everybodys Trying To Be My Baby-Bruce Springsteen &amp; Steve Earle (6-02-1998 TradeWinds, Seabright,NJ)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Vx3vw4MUv4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>That was a one-off for Bruce; he hasn&#8217;t played &#8220;Everybody&#8217;s Trying to Be My Baby&#8221; since.
