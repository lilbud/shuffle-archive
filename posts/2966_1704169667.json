Sherry Darling (Bruce Springsteen- Live In Charleston 8-4-1978)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GGbQrp6s3rE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>It&#8217;s easy to figure out why Bruce didn&#8217;t release it sooner&#8211;it would have been jarringly out of place on the sober\u00a0<em>Darkness on the Edge of Town</em> album. But it&#8217;s also easy to figure out why he played it often on the Darkness Tour&#8211;and pretty much exclusively in the summer.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Sherry Darling&#8221; is a summer song, not only in its setting (with a &#8220;hot sun beating on the black top&#8221; and the &#8220;girls melting on the beach&#8221;), but also in its spirit. &#8220;Sherry Darling&#8221; is loose, carefree, and the biggest problem on the narrator&#8217;s shoulders is the ever-present mother of his girlfriend.</p>\n<p>In early performance, Bruce called for the audience to create lots of &#8220;party noises,&#8221; which the E Street Band would eventually supply on vinyl. That&#8217;s because &#8220;Sherry Darling&#8221; is meant to evoke the classic fraternity rock sound&#8211;or as Bruce would put it, where the audience is louder than the band.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Sherry Darling&#8221; is raucous by design&#8211;we have too much fun to take issue with the callousness and short fuse of the protagonist, who is nearing his limit of what he&#8217;ll put up with for his girl:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Your Mamma&#8217;s yapping in the back seat</em><br />\n<em>Tell her to push over and move them big feet</em><br />\n<em>Every Monday morning I gotta drive her down to the unemployment agency</em><br />\n<em>Well this morning I ain&#8217;t fighting, tell her I give up</em><br />\n<em>Tell her she wins if she&#8217;ll just shut up</em><br />\n<em>But it&#8217;s the last time that she&#8217;s gonna be riding with me</em></p>\n<p>He talks a good game, doesn&#8217;t he? But listen to his tone soften toward the end of the chorus, and you can&#8217;t help but suspect he&#8217;s perhaps bluffing a bit:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>And you can tell her there&#8217;s a hot sun beating on the black top</em><br />\n<em>She keeps talking she&#8217;ll be walking that last block</em><br />\n<em>And she can take a subway back to the ghetto tonight</em><br />\n<em>Well I got some beer and the highway&#8217;s free</em><br />\n<em>And I got you and baby you&#8217;ve got me</em><br />\n<em>Hey, hey, hey, what you say, Sherry Darling</em></p>\n<p>When you&#8217;re young, and you have nothing but time, a car, a girl, and some beer&#8230; it&#8217;s pretty clear that our hero&#8217;s frustration is less about his girl&#8217;s mom, and more about the fleetingness of summer:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Now there&#8217;s girls melting on the beach</em><br />\n<em>And they&#8217;re so fine but so out of reach</em><br />\n<em>&#8216;Cause I&#8217;m stuck in traffic down here on 53rd Street</em><br />\n<em>Now Sherry my love for you is real</em><br />\n<em>But I didn&#8217;t count on this package deal</em><br />\n<em>And baby this car just ain&#8217;t big enough for her and me</em></p>\n<p>There&#8217;s just a <em>bit</em> of doubt here: so many girls, so little summertime! Is Sherry really worth the aggravation?</p>\n<p>Bruce answers that in the last chorus, where the protagonist suddenly lapses into romantic rhapsody:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Well let there be sunlight, let there be rain</em><br />\n<em>Let the brokenhearted love again</em><br />\n<em>Sherry, we can run with our arms open wide before the tide</em><br />\n<em>To all the girls down at Sacred Heart</em><br />\n<em>And all you operators back in the park</em><br />\n<em>Say hey, hey, hey, what you say, Sherry Darling</em></p>\n<p>Sorry, girls&#8211;and enjoy your conquests, you operators&#8211;our guy has Sherry, and that&#8217;s all he needs and wants.</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t get suckered by the bravado and the machismo&#8211;&#8220;Sherry Darling&#8221; is as romantic as &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/02/27/roll-of-the-dice-drive-all-night/\">Drive All Night</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>And can we talk about the band for a minute? It takes a lot of practice and a ton of camaraderie (and a great bandleader) to sound this loose and free-wheeling and yet still hold together. &#8220;Sherry Darling&#8221; captures not only the skill but also the spirit of the E Street Band at the top of their game.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Sherry Darling&#8221; continues to be a summer staple&#8211;outside of both River tours (1980-81 and 2016), it pretty much only ever gets performed in the hotter months&#8211;and when she comes out, you know you&#8217;re in for a loose, fun evening.</p>\n<p><strong>Bonus clip:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>On his 2005 solo tour stop in Grand Rapids, Bruce performed &#8220;Sherry Darling&#8221; by himself on electric piano for the first and only time. It&#8217;s novel, but far from essential. &#8220;Sherry Darling&#8221; needs a peanut gallery.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Sherry Darling\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TlYjluwtyls?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><strong>Sherry Darling</strong><br />\n<strong>Recorded:</strong> May 1979 &#8211; April 1980<br />\n<strong>Released:</strong>\u00a0<em>The River</em> (1980)<br />\n<strong>First performed:</strong> August 4, 1978 (Charleston, WV)<br />\n<strong>Last performed:</strong> August 30, 2023 (East Rutherford, NJ)</p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
