But who to choose?</p>\n<p>Moa had a few rules for selecting an artist, which she shared in a <a href=\"https://www.rudolfsmusic.com/moa-holmsten-interview/\">RudolphsMusic interview</a>: &#8220;Someone that was far from my own music, someone that was pretty new to me and that had a big catalogue of songs.
