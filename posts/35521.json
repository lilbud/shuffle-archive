When Bruce first sent his fifth studio album to his record label, it was only a single disc entitled\u00a0<em>The Ties That Bind</em>, and &#8220;Loose End&#8221; was the closing song.</p>\n<p>And what a magnificent album closer it would have been: musically lush in the Spectorian girl group mold (even more so than &#8220;Born to Run&#8221;),\u00a0 but lyrically dark, hopeless and fatalistic. Had Bruce released it as intended, &#8220;Loose End&#8221; would have become Bruce&#8217;s first true relationship song as well as the standard bearer for his trademark juxtaposition of poppy melody with somber lyrics. (<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/12/21/roll-of-the-dice-hungry-heart/\">&#8220;Hungry Heart</a>&#8221; holds that honor instead.)</p>\n<p>&#8220;Loose End&#8221; is the story of a relationship turned toxic. Like all great loves, it starts like a storybook, and Bruce employs some of his most romantic lyrics to date to paint the scene.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>We met out on open streets when we had no place to go</em><br />\n<em>I remember how my heart beat when you said &#8220;I love you so</em>&#8220;</p>\n<p>Which makes the tonal shift in the third line all the more shocking:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Then little by little we choked out all the life that our love could hold</em><br />\n<em>No no</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>It&#8217;s like we had a noose and baby without check</em><br />\n<em>We pulled &#8217;til it grew tighter around our necks</em><br />\n<em>Each one waiting for the other, darling to say when</em><br />\n<em>Well baby you can meet me tonight on the loose end</em></p>\n<p>The titular metaphor is a brutal one: Their relationship is like a noose, and our lovers pull it ever tighter, choking the life out of their love. Both partners are miserable, but neither is willing to flinch&#8211;waiting instead for the other to be the one to break it off.</p>\n<p>Unable to bring themselves to leave a relationship growing increasingly toxic, they do the only thing they <em>can</em> do: meet on the loose end of the noose&#8211;the side that keeps shrinking and shrinking.</p>\n<p>Honestly, Bruce could have stopped writing at this point. The remaining verses only underline the same sad story without imparting any new information. But that&#8217;s the point: just like in their relationship, our narrator is caught up in a cycle and unable to break himself free.</p>\n<p>All he can do is look backward and remember a past that grows increasingly rosy as his present darkens.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>We didn&#8217;t count tomorrows, we took what we could and baby we ran</em><br />\n<em>There was no time for sorrow, every place we went I held your hand</em><br />\n<em>And when the night closed in I was sure your kisses told me all I had to know</em><br />\n<em>But oh no</em></p>\n<p>In the final verse, our narrator acknowledges what has become obvious: their love affair was no more impervious than any other, but knowing their love has died isn&#8217;t the same thing as understanding why&#8211;which brings us to the most anguished line in the song.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Our love has fallen around us like we said it never could</em><br />\n<em>We saw it happen to all the others but to us it never would</em><br />\n<em>Well how could something so bad, darling, come from something that was so good</em><br />\n<em>I don&#8217;t know</em></p>\n<p>How could something so bad come from something so good?</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s never stated, but the tragedy of &#8220;Loose End&#8221; is that our characters didn&#8217;t notice their love dying as it happened&#8211;only once it was too late. Even so, neither character can bring themselves to be the one to call a time of death; instead, they cling to the withered husk of their relationship hoping the other person will take mercy and pronounce it over.</p>\n<p>Recorded only a few months shy of Springsteen&#8217;s 30th birthday, &#8220;Loose End&#8221; is a remarkably astute and mature observation for a songwriter who didn&#8217;t think himself ready to write about relationships yet.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Loose End&#8221; takes place primarily in the past&#8211;only the last line of each verse hints at the darkness to come (and of course the entire chorus). That&#8217;s probably why Bruce wisely chose to root it in retro musical style.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Loose End&#8221; is\u00a0<em>big.\u00a0</em>It&#8217;s lush, romantic, swooning. Clarence plays one of his best and longest solos on record, and Bruce layers his own voice for background, turning in one of his warmest vocal performances to date.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s so much going on in &#8220;Loose End,&#8221; in fact, that it took many attempts to get it right&#8211;and even then, Bruce released two distinct versions&#8211;one on his 1998 <em>Tracks\u00a0</em>box set, the other in his\u00a0<em>The Ties That Bind: The River Collection</em> box set. Take a listen to the latter below and see if you can pick out the differences. (The most obvious is the coda.)</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Loose Ends\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7RvmALTXl1Y?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>In concert, &#8220;Loose End&#8221; has always been a rarity, played less then three dozen times to date, and never prior to the Reunion Tour in 1999.
