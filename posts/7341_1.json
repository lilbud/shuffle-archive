Heck, he wasn&#8217;t even their fiftieth choice.<\/p>\n<p>But time was running out. Columbia&#8217;s destined-to-be-a-classic summer blockbuster was only days away from release, and it\u00a0<em>still<\/em> didn&#8217;t have a title song.<\/p>\n<p>Parker was a big name, but he was known for writing R&amp;B love songs, not motion picture theme songs. But he was in the rolodex of Columbia SVP Gary LeMel, who reached out in desperation with offer equally desperate: a $50,000 advance for two days&#8217; work (that&#8217;s all the time that was left in the schedule), and Parker could keep the money even if the song was unusable.<\/p>\n<p>Even so, Parker was reluctant. &#8220;[Ghostbusters]&#8230; that&#8217;s a really terrible word to try and sing,&#8221; he recalled in a recent interview. But the film&#8217;s director was insistent: the title needed to be in the song.<\/p>\n<p>Parker took the job, and the studio gave him the movie&#8217;s montage scene (where the song was meant to play) temporarily backed with &#8220;I Want a New Drug&#8221; by Huey Lewis and the News, a decision that proved fateful.<\/p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"RAY PARKER JR.

Forcing himself to stay awake on the final evening, he saw a late-night commercial for an exterminator that inspired the song&#8217;s classic call-and response tagline.<\/p>\n<p>Parker was right: <em>Ghostbusters<\/em> is a terrible song to sing, let alone rhyme. His epiphany was realizing he didn&#8217;t have to do either.<\/p>\n<p>Completing the song at the eleventh hour, he sent it off to the studio, and the rest is pop culture history (undoubtedly helped by a memorable music video packed with pop star cameos).<\/p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Ray Parker Jr. - Ghostbusters (Official HD Video)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Fe93CLbHjxQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Huey Lewis was not amused, however.
