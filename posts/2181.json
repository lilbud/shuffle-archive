I won&#8217;t spoil it for you, but I&#8217;ll argue that Bruce&#8217;s song &#8220;Lift Me Up,&#8221; which plays over the end credits of the film, has both everything and nothing to do with the film. It&#8217;s a perfectly haunting melodic exit for an unsettling piece of visual art.</p>\n<p>That said, let&#8217;s tackle &#8220;Lift Me Up&#8221; on its own.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - Lift Me Up\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/71g3Wzgev8U?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Bruce wrote &#8220;Lift Me Up&#8221; on request from <em>Limbo</em> director John Sayles and producer Maggie Renzi, who ran into Bruce at an airport and asked if he could provide a song for the end of the film&#8211;something that was simultaneously about healing and risk.</p>\n<p>Bruce had reportedly been working on a song for about three years that he thought might work. (Note: given that the film came out in 1999, that would make &#8220;Lift Me Up&#8221; a likely castoff from\u00a0<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2023/06/03/album-companion-the-ghost-of-tom-joad/\"><em>The Ghost of Tom Joad</em></a>.</p>\n<p>Bruce sings the entire song in a falsetto&#8211;something Bruce had experimented with before but never fully committed to&#8211;which amplifies the ethereal nature of the melody. Bruce also plays all instruments&#8211;guitar, bass, keyboards, percussion&#8211;making this track a truly solo effort.</p>\n<p>The lyrics are classic romantic Bruce: a pledge of and request for unconditional love, without any promise or prediction for what may come. Interestingly, it seems the object of the narrator&#8217;s affection may already be promised to another:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>I don&#8217;t need your answered prayers</em><br />\n<em>Or the chains your lover wears</em><br />\n<em>I don&#8217;t need your rings of gold</em><br />\n<em>Or the secrets that you hold</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Lift me up, darling</em><br />\n<em>Lift me up and I&#8217;ll fall with you lift me up</em><br />\n<em>Let your love lift me up</em></p>\n<p>The chains and rings may be metaphor, but they may also be literal&#8211;a wedding ring. Indeed, the second verse implies that the narrator doesn&#8217;t care about the marital state of his love, so long as she doesn&#8217;t abandon him:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>I don&#8217;t need your sacred vow</em><br />\n<em>Or the promise tomorrow brings</em><br />\n<em>Veiled behind the morning clouds</em><br />\n<em>I&#8217;ll take the fate the daylight brings</em></p>\n<p>The final verse has echoes of &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/02/05/roll-of-the-dice-countin-on-a-miracle/\">Countin&#8217; on a Miracle</a>,&#8221; with the narrator savoring every detail, every sensation, in case they never come again:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Your skin, your hand upon my neck</em><br />\n<em>This skin, your fingers on my skin</em><br />\n<em>This kiss, this heartbeat, this breath</em><br />\n<em>This heart, this heart, this wilderness</em></p>\n<p>After a final chorus, the songs drifts leisurely into the sky, lifted by Bruce&#8217;s wordless promise, with the fate of the song&#8217;s central characters very much in&#8230; limbo.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Lift Me Up&#8221; is too delicate for a full band concert, but Bruce did perform it once&#8211;and only once&#8211;on his 2005 solo tour. Here&#8217;s that performance, from Columbus, OH, July 31, 2005. It&#8217;s so quiet and restrained that must have taken consider effort on both Bruce&#8217;s and the audience&#8217;s part to create a bubble for the song to live in.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen- Lift Me Up (Acoustic)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8dJ7MLK8OeI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>For an obscure track that few mainstream fans are aware exists, &#8220;Lift Me Up&#8221; is surprisingly easy to find: in addition to the soundtrack for\u00a0<em>Limbo</em>, you can find it on\u00a0<em>The Essential Bruce Springsteen</em>, playing over the end credits on the 2001 release of\u00a0<em>The Complete Video Anthology</em> and on the official archive release for the Columbus 2005 show.</p>\n<p>But I still maintain that to appreciate the song fully, watch it in context with the film.
