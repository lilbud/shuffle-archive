Growing up in the city, something about the idea of being able to escape it simply by climbing appealed to me. I lived in the middle of a long string of row homes, so I never saw my own rooftop&#8211;and that made the notion all the more romantic, mysterious and enchanting.</p>\n<p>The song itself was written by Carole King and Gerry Goffin, and recorded by The Drifters. It was a huge hit upon its release in 1962, charting at Number 5 on the U.S. pop chart and a notch higher on the R&amp;B chart. The lyrics are wistful, but the song really takes flight on the wings of its soaring melody&#8211;listen to it with your eyes closed, and you&#8217;ll instantly be transported to the rooftops.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Up on the Roof\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MMyDiHNNq1Y?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Bruce covered &#8220;Up on the Roof&#8221; a handful of times during the early days of the Born to Run Tour in the summer of 1975. The song&#8217;s romantic, escapist cityscape fit perfectly into the BTR-centric setlist.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, of the seven times Bruce performed the song that summer, not a one was captured in good, clear quality. But you can listen to Bruce&#8217;s first-ever and last-ever performances below and hear how it evolved over those weeks. Bruce reportedly would sing the song while sitting on the edge of the stage&#8211;not quite acoustically, but with a quiet and restrained E Street Band in full crooner mode, doing their best Drifters impression.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - &quot;Up on the Roof&quot; - Washington DC, 1975-07-30\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eYu78f4lNvs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen - UP ON THE ROOF  1975  (audio)\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BQKT-okc3G8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Bruce&#8217;s performances of &#8220;Up on the Roof&#8221; were sweet and tender, unlikely candidates for translation into today&#8217;s arenas and stadiums.
