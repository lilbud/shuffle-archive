When it answered a call, it would play an outgoing message, and then (just like with voice mail) it would record the caller&#8217;s incoming message after a tone. When you returned home, you&#8217;d rewind the tape and play back your messages.</p>\n<p>By the mid-1980s, answering machines had grown from a novelty item into a necessity, and the creativity of your outgoing message was a topic of frequent conversation and judgment.</p>\n<p>If you had an answering machine, it&#8217;s a safe bet that at one point or another you agonized over coming up with a greeting that would make people smile or laugh. We all did&#8211;even rock stars.</p>\n<div id=\"v-zL8OU1w8-1\" class=\"video-player\"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='758' height='568' src='https://videopress.com/embed/zL8OU1w8?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;muted=0&amp;controls=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;useAverageColor=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script data-jetpack-boost=\"ignore\" src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js'></script></div>\n<p>Okay, that wasn&#8217;t real.</p>\n<p>But still, I guarantee you that even Bruce Springsteen spent more time than he&#8217;d have cared to admit coming up with a great answering machine message.</p>\n<p>It was time well spent, though, because his\u00a0<em>actual</em> answering machine message was pretty darn awesome. And yes, this one is a genuine, unreleased, original Springsteen composition.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bruce Springsteen&#039;s Answering Machine Message\" width=\"758\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xZOfaAQRLgo?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;Answering Machine&#8221; (as this unreleased gem has come to be known) is a fine example of a classic early-eighties Springsteen song: a rocking, uptempo melody that masks the disconnection and alienation in Bruce&#8217;s lyrics.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Yeah, there ain&#8217;t nobody home</em><br />\n<em>Yeah, there ain&#8217;t nobody home</em><br />\n<em>Yeah, there ain&#8217;t nobody home to come to the telephone</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>I don&#8217;t know when I&#8217;m coming back</em><br />\n<em>I don&#8217;t know when I&#8217;m coming back</em><br />\n<em>I don&#8217;t know when I&#8217;m coming back, if you got something to say, you better spit it out, Jack</em></p>\n<p>While we don&#8217;t know exactly when &#8220;Answering Machine&#8221; was written, the reprise of the back/Jack couplet suggests that it&#8217;s a sequel&#8211;or perhaps even a prequel&#8211;to &#8220;<a href=\"https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/12/21/roll-of-the-dice-hungry-heart/\">Hungry Heart</a>.&#8221; One imagines the narrator of that 1980 classic recording this outgoing message in his Baltimore home just before he goes out for his fateful ride.</p>\n<p>Unlike &#8220;Hungry Heart,&#8221; however, Bruce offers the narrator of &#8220;Answering Machine&#8221; the possibility of redemption. By leaving the metaphorical door open (&#8220;I don&#8217;t know\u00a0<em>when</em> I&#8217;m coming back&#8221; suggests that he might someday), Bruce waters a seed of hope for his narrator&#8217;s return home after his latest Kingstown fling.</p>\n<p>With &#8220;Answering Machine,&#8221; Bruce once again displays his impressive talent for songwriting economy, this time honed to a razor-sharp edge. In a mere thirty seconds, we experience and empathize with his character&#8217;s loneliness, self-loathing (&#8220;there ain&#8217;t nobody home&#8221;), rootlessness, and resilience. It&#8217;s wholly appropriate that he recorded it solo, Nebraska-style, rather than with his band.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Answering Machine&#8221; is a tour de force that belongs in every Springsteen fan&#8217;s collection.</p>\n<p><strong>Answering Machine<br />\n</strong><strong>Recorded:\u00a0</strong>Unknown<br />\n<strong>Never released</strong><br />\n<strong>Never performed</strong></p>\n<p>Looking for your favorite Bruce song?
