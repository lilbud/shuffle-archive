He&#8217;s performed with Bruce twice before (including a wonderful <a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/06/18/kingdom-of-days-june-18/\">&#8220;Wreck on the Highway&#8221; duet</a>), and Bruce hand-picked Harding to be his opening act&#8211;Bruce&#8217;s first in two decades&#8211;during his 1995 Berkeley gigs.</p>\n<p>Harding has a new album out this year&#8211;brilliantly entitled <em>Greatest Other People&#8217;s Hits</em>&#8212; and it includes his wonderful cover of &#8220;<a href=\"http://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/11/04/roll-of-the-dice-jackson-cage/\">Jackson Cage,</a>&#8221; originally recorded and released in 1997 on the\u00a0<em>One Step Up/Two Steps Back\u00a0</em>tribute album. It&#8217;s also available as a bonus track on the reissue of his\u00a0<em>Awake</em> album.</p>\n<p>And yes, it&#8217;s worth three separate releases for a cover this good. I&#8217;ve always thought &#8220;Jackson Cage&#8221; works better as an acoustic ballad rather than an electric rocker, and Harding&#8217;s arrangement proves it: backed by guitar and a melancholy violin, Harding captures the sadness and the sense of being trapped that&#8217;s at the heart of the song without the anger of Bruce&#8217;s original version. The end result is a song that feels more resigned than frustrated, more tender than angry.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a short list of covers that I like more than the original, but Harding&#8217;s version of &#8220;Jackson Cage&#8221; is certainly on it.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"John Wesley Harding : Jackson Cage\" width=\"758\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y178uxATtrk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>Available on three different album releases, John Wesley Harding&#8217;s cover of &#8220;Jackson Cage&#8221; deserves its repeated exposure.
