<p>I’m kicking off a new blog series with today’s entry. It’s called <em>Spare Parts</em>, because I honestly have
        no idea how else to classify this clip.</p>
<p>But: it’s seasonal, charming, and good-naturedly funny. So without further ado, here’s Xander Green and Gil
        Varod’s tale of How the Boss Saved Christmas from December 15, 2018.</p>

            Christmas</a></p>
<p>Green is obviously a fan: even though his voice isn’t anywhere near a close match for Bruce’s, his vocal patterns
        and phrasings are knowing, and there are a couple of great piano references to those mid-seventies bootlegs.</p>
<p>So thanks for the chuckle, Xander and Gil, and happy holidays!</p>
<h2>Spare Parts: Cheap Motel</h2><div><h3>Originally Published: January 11, 2020</h3></div>
<p>I’m glad I started this “Spare Parts” series recently, because I’d have no idea how else to classify this, to be
        honest.</p>
<p>In one sense, “Cheap Motel” is an original Springsteen song in that Bruce wrote the music. But he didn’t write
        the lyrics–the great Joe Grushecky supplied those.</p>
<p>(The lyrics sure read like a Springsteen song, though: Joe’s “I had a job/I had a girl” protagonist drifts
        through the American southwest until he’s picked up by the police for building a bomb(!). Given that the two men
        wrote the song together in 1995 during the same time that Bruce was recording <em>The Ghost
            of Tom Joad</em>, it certainly seems like Joe was at least strongly influenced by Bruce’s
        then-current recording project.)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Mz3q2pKR74">Watch on Youtube: Joe Grushecky- "Cheap Motel" co-written
            by Bruce</a></p>
<p>In another sense, it’s a cover, because Bruce didn’t play any part in the studio recording.</p>
<p>And at the same time, it’s neither–It’s Joe’s song (the lyrics at least) and his own recording.</p>
<p>But Bruce’s stamp is on the song through his music and his influence, so it gets an entry on the Shuffle. Plus
        it’s a great song, so enjoy.</p>

<h2>Live Music for Quarantined Springsteen Fans</h2><div><h3>Originally Published: March 24, 2020</h3></div>
<p>I’ve never used this blog to promote events before, but we’re all together in uncharted territory at the moment.
    </p>
<p>So if you’re doing the responsible thing and staying home to halt the spread of the global pandemic, first of
        all: <em>thank you</em>. I know it’s hard, and the costs vary for each of us, but we’re all saving lives.</p>
<p>Second, although it’s far, far, <em>far</em> from the most dire consequence of our current situation, I can’t
        help but miss the presence of live music in my life–and I know from exchanging e-mail, tweets, and facebook
        comments that many of you feel the same way.</p>
<p>So I want to make sure that no one misses out on a couple of great upcoming events because they didn’t know about
        it in time. If you’re a Springsteen fan (and if not, why else are you reading this blog?), here are a couple of
        watch-from-home events you won’t want to miss:</p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ET007ZjWkAYyPrn?format=jpg&amp;name=orig"/></p>
<p>Tomorrow night, March
        25th at 8pm Eastern Daylight Time (not EST as it says in the graphic), the great Joe Grushecky will perform
        live, presumably from his home.</p>
<p>I feature Joe’s music frequently here on the Shuffle due to his many, many collaborations with Bruce and their
        decades-long friendship, but if you haven’t checked out his music before, here’s a great opportunity to do so.
        I’ll be on the livestream on Joe’s facebook page–hope to see you there, too.</p>
<p>Next up: a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/552991608622664/?acontext=%7B%22source%22%3A1%2C%22action_history%22%3A%22%5B%7B%5C%22surface%5C%22%3A%5C%22permalink%5C%22%2C%5C%22mechanism%5C%22%3A%5C%22surface%5C%22%2C%5C%22extra_data%5C%22%3A%5B%5D%7D%5D%22%2C%22has_source%22%3Atrue%7D&amp;source=1&amp;action_history=%5B%7B%22surface%22%3A%22permalink%22%2C%22mechanism%22%3A%22surface%22%2C%22extra_data%22%3A%5B%5D%7D%5D&amp;has_source=1&amp;__tn__=%2CdK-R-R&amp;eid=ARBdjHjJtua2-GQUpYv9Q_ZFSAd6mbaKK2lVetIJez6kfnqvscPhIFNqe5dd3IUBY1xZvwcw_Oe6DjqT&amp;fref=mentions">very
            special benefit concert</a> by some of the best musicians on the Jersey Shore, all performing from their
        homes. Many of the names below will be familiar to fans of Bruce Springsteen and the Asbury Park music scene,
        but trust me–even if you’re not familiar with most of the artists, this is bound to be a great event for any fan
        of the Jersey Shore sound.</p>
<p><img alt="" height="984" id="17219" src="https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/stayathome.jpg" width="758"/></p>
<p>RSVP <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/552991608622664/">here</a>, and join me (virtually) at the show
        from the comfort of your own home on Saturday, April 4th at 8pm EDT.</p>
<p>Finally, while Bruce has yet to join the group of artists performing live over the Internet, that doesn’t mean
        he’s not doing what he can to help his community. For those of  you in the New Jersey area, who have family and
        friends in New Jersey, or who appreciate all the great music and memories brought to you from the garden state,
        consider responding to Bruce’s plea below  by supporting the New Jersey Pandemic Relief Fund.</p>

<p>That’s it for now, but hopefully there will be even more live music to help us through the months ahead.</p>
<p>In the meantime, as long as I stay healthy, I’ll keep my twice-daily update streak (now at 810 consecutive days
        and counting) going, with occasional bonus posts like this one. I hope it provides a little daily diversion to
        your stay-at-home routine!</p>
<p>Stay well and healthy, everyone!</p>

<h2>Spare Parts: Michael Petrella: Dancing in the Dark/I Wanna Dance With Somebody</h2><div><h3>Originally Published: April 16, 2020</h3></div>
<p>And now for something completely different:</p>
<p>I don’t have a blog category for mash-ups, but maybe I should, because I’ve got a few of these in my back pocket
        to share.</p>
<p>Let’s start with Michael Petrella and Eric. I don’t know much about Michael (and even less about Eric, like
        whether he has a last name), but I do know he’s got a pretty clever ear for a mash-up. I don’t think I could
        have ever come up with a Bruce Springsteen/Whitney Houston pairing that would work well, but Michael and Eric
        sure did.</p>
<p>Check out their clever cover mash-up of “Dancing in the
        Dark” with “I Wanna Dance With Somebody.” Not only do they blend well musically, the lyrics match
        hand-in-glove, too.</p>

<h2>Have a Good Time… But Get Out Alive!</h2><div><h3>Originally Published: May 22, 2020</h3></div>
<p>“…the strongest album an American band has made this year, and when the year ends, the word “American” may come
        off.” — <em>Village Voice</em></p>
<p>“A new American classic… the Iron City Houserockers take for granted an authenticity that Springsteen has to
        strive for.” — <em>Rolling Stone</em></p>
<p>“One of the strongest, most uncompromising and impassioned pieces of vinyl to come across this year… one of the
        most important rock bands to hit the streets since Graham Parker and the Rumour.” – <em>Detroit Free Press</em>
</p>
<p>“One of the best albums released so far this year… in intelligence, perspective and rock ‘n’ roll it is not
        unlike an American version of The Clash.” —<em>Lincoln Journal Star</em></p>
<p>“If you’re tired of listening to the sort of pseudo-punks who sound like they can always re-enroll in art school,
        check out the genuinely passionate Houserockers. These guys know what it means to play rock ‘n’ roll as if there
        were no other salvation.” — <em>Boston Globe</em></p>
<p>In the summer of 1980, the music press was abuzz with the arrival of the album that many felt would come to
        define rock and roll in the eighties: The Iron City Houserockers’ <em>Have a Good Time But… Get Out Alive</em>.
    </p>
<p>History played out a little differently, of course. Still, four decades on, the 40th anniversary reissue of
        <em>Have a Good Time But…Get Out Alive</em> (<a href="https://store.clevelandinternational.com/">released
            today</a> digitally, available June 19th on LP and CD) still stands as the epitome of Pittsburgh rock. The
        reissue sounds as fresh and fierce as ever–more so in fact, thanks to a noticeable sonic upgrade.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3B7gGs5FyE">Watch on Youtube: Have a Good Time (But Get Out Alive)</a>
</p>
<p>Even if you were around and aware at the time, it’s understandable if you missed the album’s original release–it
        was back in the day when artists and bands had regional followings. and the Houserockers definitely had a
        regional sound. Grushecky attributes the album’s magic to “a mixture of Pittsburgh Rock n’ Roll, Jersey Shore
        savvy and soul, and English mystic and muscle.” Credit Steve Van Zandt, Mick Ronson, and Ian Hunter for some of
        that infusion (they all contributed to the album), but the influence was there from the Houserockers’ very first
        album, <em>Love’s So Tough</em>.</p>
<p>Critics and fans were quick to pick up on the similarities in sound and sensibilities between the Houserockers’
        32-year-old lead singer and a certain New Jersey rocker, and comparisons (mostly favorable) abounded in reviews
        and articles.</p>
<p>The band even drew the notice of Bruce himself, who dedicated “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/07/04/roll-of-the-dice-the-promised-land/">The Promised
            Land</a>” to “Joe and the Iron City boys” when he came through their hometown of Pittsburgh that autumn.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1Ab0iyJitA">Watch on Youtube: Bruce Springsteen - "The Promised Land" -
            Pittsburgh, 1980-11-30</a></p>
<p>Bruce Springsteen and Joe Grushecky had already met by that time, introduced to each other by Steve Van Zandt,
        who arranged five tracks for <em>Have a Good Time</em> and played guitar on one.</p>
<p>“[Steve] was going back and forth between our session and <em>The River</em> with Springsteen and the E Street
        Band,” Grushecky told <em>Rolling Stone</em> in 2011. “One night I walked with him to the Power Station and he
        introduced me to Bruce. Over the years we became friends. We had a lot of similarities in upbringing and age and
        the whole nine yards. He was playing the same songs in New Jersey that I was playing here in Pittsburgh.”</p>
<p>Joe and Bruce do indeed share a lot in common: born one year and one state apart, they both became local heroes
        and civic figures, giving voice and giving back to those otherwise mostly ignored by popular music.</p>
<p>Only one became a superstar on the global stage, however. A year after their release, <em>The River </em>was
        flying high, but <em>Have a Good Time </em>had run its course. The Houserockers would go on to release two more
        albums, and Joe would bring us great music for decades to come (frequently collaborating with Bruce, who
        produced Joe’s 1995 <a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/10/17/american-babylon-a-retrospective/"><em>American
                Babylon</em></a> album that brought him to the attention of Springsteen fans like me), but none would
        garner the attention that <em>Have a Good Time</em> commanded during the summer of 1980.</p>
<p>But there’s another differentiator between the two famously blue-collar musicians: only one of them actually wore
        a collar at all. Bruce Springsteen employs keen observation and deep empathy when crafting his songs. Joe
        Grushecky, by contrast, draws from a well of first-hand experience.</p>
<p>Joe has been a special education teacher for most of his adult life, focusing on the hardest and most hardened of
        high school students. Today, at the age of 72, Joe continues to teach by day and rock by night. (Even during the
        pandemic, you can catch him live at home every Wednesday night <a href="https://www.facebook.com/JoeGrushecky/">here</a>.) He actually is the working man he and Bruce have
        always written about.</p>
<p>I’ve always been fascinated by the fact of Joe’s dual identity. (Who among us hasn’t fantasized about a second
        life as a rock star?) Is Superman really Clark Kent, or is it the reverse? That’s basically the first question I
        asked him when we spoke recently: How would Joe Grushecky introduce himself to a stranger sitting next to him on
        a plane?</p>
<p>“Oh, I’m a musician,” he responded. “I like teaching, but music’s my passion.”</p>
<p>He’s spent his life doing both. He started teaching back in the seventies, and the first job he stuck with was
        working with kids with severe developmental, physical, and emotional disabilities. “One kid could talk, nobody
        could walk, nobody was toilet trained… Older people didn’t want to work there, but I was a young buck.” It was a
        challenging environment for a teacher of any age: “I had to tell them, please have these kids dressed when
        they’re here!”</p>
<p>Not many people have the empathy and stamina to last in a role like that, but while Joe left teaching temporarily
        when he embarked on his music career, he came back to it when he needed the supplemental income–this time as a
        special education teacher in a public high school–and has stuck with it ever since.</p>
<p>I’m married to a high school special ed teacher, so I thought I could identify with the challenges of Joe’s day
        job. But I was wrong: his Pittsburgh school is a little rougher than my wife’s school in suburban Seattle. “Our
        school district is one of the poorest and worst districts for violent crimes. One of my students was arrested
        for murder. One summer about eight years ago, between prom and school starting there were fourteen kids involved
        in murders, arrested or killed.”</p>
<p>Joe may lead two separate lives, but they occasionally overlap: Songs like and “First Day of School” and “Who
        Cares About Those Kids” (both on his 2013 <em>Somewhere East of Eden </em>album) are inspired by first-hand
        experience (“What affects me most is seeing that day to day struggle”), and for a long time, Joe brought music
        into the classroom, working with kids to mount an annual themed rock and roll show–one year a salute to the
        1960s, another year to the nineties. This year, he took his students into the studio.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTUM-GRFF2A">Watch on Youtube: Who Cares About Those Kids</a></p>
<p>Over the years, Joe’s been an active school and community fundraiser, helping the school get new band uniforms
        (They wore the same ones for forty years!), computers, supplies, whatever’s needed. When Pittsburgh was ravaged
        by Hurricane Ivan-induced floods in 2004, it was Grushecky who organized a benefit show and pulled in
        Springsteen.</p>
<p>One of the songs Bruce and Joe played that night was “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/11/03/meeting-across-the-river-bruce-springsteen-and-joe-grushecky-pumping-iron/">Pumping
            Iron</a>,” the most enduring and Pittsburghian track from <em>Have a Good Time</em>.</p>
<p><a href="https://videopress.com/embed/gYVg7t5Y">Watch Video Highlight</a></p>
<p>“Pumping Iron” has become Joe’s anthem, and over the years, he and Bruce have played it together 25 times. To put
        that in perspective, until Bruce started playing <em>The River</em> in full in 2016, that’s about the same
        number of times he played “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/04/28/roll-of-the-dice-fade-away/">Fade Away</a>” along with
        about an album-side worth of tracks from Bruce’s own 1980 LP.</p>
<p>“Pumping Iron” was even one of the last songs Bruce performed live before the great pandemic of 2020 took him,
        Joe, and every other musician off the stage for the time being.</p>

<p>But the <em>Have a Good Time</em> reissue offers far more treasures for both long-time and new-found fans
        alike–in the form of a bonus disc of outtakes and covers, carefully transferred from cassette and decades-old
        reel-to-reel. “I could’ve made three discs from those tapes,” he admitted, but he had to be careful. The reels
        hadn’t been played in a long time, and Joe was worried they would fall apart.</p>
<p>Of the bonus tracks, the one that stopped me in my tracks was the six-and-a-half-minute version of “Don’t Let
        Them Push You Around,” a full four minutes longer than the taut thrasher that graces the released disc.</p>
<p>“That one stopped me in my tracks too!” Joe laughed. It’s not just the length, I remarked–it’s how much is going
        on. I was about to compare it to Bruce’s “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/09/24/roll-of-the-dice-thundercrack/">Thundercrack</a>” or
        “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/01/22/roll-of-the-dice-kittys-back/">Kitty’s Back,</a>” when
        Joe beat me to the punch:</p>
<p>“It was my epic, you know, like ‘Freebird,’ or ‘Rosalita,'” the kind of song you play at the end of the night
        when it’s time to pull out all the stops.</p>
<p>You can definitely hear the punk vein, I said, especially at the outset. “But then it just takes a left turn. On
        the album, you lean all the way in and just <em>commit</em> to the punk–is that Steve’s influence?”</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F819151768&amp;show_artwork=true&amp;maxheight=1000&amp;maxwidth=758">Dont
            Let Them Push You Around (demo) by spopovich34</a></p>
<p>“Yeah, Steve heard it and reworked it. We basically just kept the guitar and harp solo!”</p>
<p>What was that like, having those guys take apart your songs and rebuild them?</p>
<p>“Well, I was a young guy. Our first record was basically our club show, no arranging or anything. Just stuff we
        were playing.  We just tightened it up for the album, left out the big long solos because of the time
        constraints.”</p>
<p>But on the second album, “we had Steve Van Zandt, Mick Ronson, and Ian Hunter, these top-flight seasoned pros in
        the studio, and they were way ahead of us. I went to college for five years, so I was behind everyone as far as
        the music business goes. Arranging, people picking your songs apart, that was a whole new experience. Being a
        young guy new to the game, it felt like someone didn’t like your song, like they were saying your kids are
        ugly!”</p>
<p>“It was a real eye-opening education. Some of the songs were completely deconstructed, others are note-for-note.”
    </p>
<p>“Hypnotized” is another fascinating bonus track, an almost eight-minute work-in-progress track that offers fans
        fascinating insight into Joe and the band working out one of my favorite songs on <em>Have a Good Time</em>. (It
        has a similar riff-driven groove to the Rolling Stones’ “Shattered.”)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kpq0sE9m2g0">Watch on Youtube: Hypnotized</a></p>
<p>Joe admitted to me that even the eight-minute outtake was actually a lot longer on the original tape: “Johnny
        [his son] and Brian [his sound engineer] talked me into putting it on the disc. It was twenty minutes long–we
        had to edit it!”</p>
<p>Why <em>Have a Good Time </em>(or for that matter, the Iron City Houserockers themselves) never achieved the
        success they so richly deserved is one of the great mysteries of rock and roll. But thanks to the wonderful new
        40th anniversary edition, there’s a new opportunity to discover the best band most of us never got to know at
        the time.</p>
<p><em>Have a Good Time But… Get Out Alive </em>is <a href="https://store.clevelandinternational.com/">available to
            order today</a> on digital; coming June 19th on LP and CD. If you’re a Houserockers fan, you already know
        you want it; if you’re an E Street Band fan, trust me: this is an album you should own.</p>
<h2>Spare Parts: Dan Patrick Fulton: (I'm/Sex) On Fire</h2><div><h3>Originally Published: July 09, 2020</h3></div><p>It’s pretty tough to do something new with “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/09/11/roll-of-the-dice-im-on-fire/">I’m on Fire</a>” — it’s very likely the most covered song in Bruce’s catalog.</p>
<p>Dan Patrick Fulton pulls it off, though, by mashing it up with “Sex on Fire” by Kings of Leon–a neat pairing that works both musically and thematically.</p>

<p>In 1993, Bruce Springsteen had just finished a year-long world tour with his new band and was, as the saying
        goes, between projects.</p>
<p>It was a good time for a friend to ask him for a favor, and Joe Grushecky needed a favor.</p>
<p>In 1993, Joe was at a career nadir. Financially struggling and creatively blocked, Joe was working constantly and
        unable to see a path forward to a new album. At his wife’s suggestion, he called Bruce and asked him if he could
        help jumpstart a new record by recording a couple of songs with him.</p>
<p>As a good friend would, Bruce said yes. Over the next year and a half, those couple of songs developed into a
        full album: Joe’s 1995 Bruce-produced masterpiece, <em>American Babylon, </em>featuring two songs co-written by
        Bruce and an album full of standout tracks.</p>
<p><em>American Babylon</em> turns 25 today, and in anticipation of the milestone Joe and I sat down a couple of
        months ago to take a look back at the making and meaning of his landmark album. While some of this story has
        been told before, Joe shared new detail and revelations that are sure to raise the eyebrows of both Grushecky
        and Springsteen fans alike.</p>
<p>I originally planned to feature excerpts from the interview in a retrospective essay, but our conversation proved
        too rich and illuminating to cut any of it. So without further ado, let’s take a trip back to <em>American
            Babylon</em> with Joe Grushecky.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Ken: First of all, Joe, thanks for making time to talk. I’ve been looking forward to this conversation
            for a long time. I’m a big fan of your music, but <em>American Babylon</em> has a special place for me. It’s
            not only my favorite of your albums, it’s my favorite album that came out that year. It’s probably one of my
            favorite albums of that entire decade, and since I don’t really get a chance very often to say to an artist
            how much I appreciate their work, I just want to thank you for that.</strong></p>
<p>Joe: Oh, I’m glad you liked it!</p>
<p><strong>I’m a big fan. So I’m curious: where does <em>American Babylon</em> rank in <em>your</em> perception of
            your catalog?</strong></p>
<p>It’s near the top. I mean, there was <a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/05/22/have-a-good-time-but-get-out-alive/"><em>Have a Good
                Time But Get Out Alive</em></a>, the 40th anniversary edition that we’re promoting now. That was the
        record that… my life began to change with <em>Love’s So Tough</em>, but it <em>really</em> hit a different level
        with <em>Have a Good Time But Get Out Alive.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_m8XucNiryNwVfJUu1EI206RMqA_KaLTK8">Watch on Youtube: Have
            a Good Time but... Get out Alive</a></p>
<p>But when I made <em>American Babylon</em>, I was down about as far as you could go. I mean <em>nothing</em> was
        going right. We couldn’t get an agent. We had put out several good records in a row and nothing happened. Nobody
        was interested in anything that I was doing, and I was working like crazy. I was playing at least two nights a
        week, sometimes three. I had a day gig working with these really poorly behaved kids, and then I was teaching
        GED at night. So I basically was working myself to death.</p>
<p><em>American Babylon</em> changed things for me in a good way, sort of beginning of an uphill climb again. I was
        very thankful–I don’t know what I’d have done without that record. I mean I’d have kept on making music, but it
        got us a lot of attention again.</p>
<p>It also cemented my relationship with Bruce. We’ve been really good friends ever since.</p>
<p><strong>There’s a lot of questions I want to ask you about the album and the songs themselves, but since you just
            brought him up, I’m curious: you’ve known Bruce a long time, well before <em>American Babylon</em>. I’ve
            read different accounts of how you guys first met.</strong></p>
<p>Well, Steven [Van Zandt] worked on <em>Have a Good Time But Get Out Alive</em>. I probably told you that before.
    </p>
<p><strong>Yeah. So it was back on the recording of that.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah. And Steve would work with us during the day and then go down and work with Bruce at the Power Station
        later. I can remember him telling us, “Bruce would really like this record. I’ve been telling Bruce about this
        record. He’d really like your band.”</p>
<p>After the initial tracks were done, we took about a two-to-three week break, and then I came back on my own to do
        overdubs, do some singing, and mixed the record with Mick Ronson and Ian Hunter. Mick was working with Meat Loaf
        on a follow-up to <em>Bat Out of Hell</em>. And one night when I got to New York, I called Mick, and he said “oh
        yeah, come down.”</p>
<p>He was working at the Power Station, and they just had a phenomenal band: Max, Garry, Nicky Hopkins, Davey
        Johnstone from Elton John’s band, and Mick Ronson playing guitar. They were cutting tracks with that band, and I
        was hanging in one room just meeting Mick, figuring out what we’re going to do the next day. And Steve and Bruce
        came up, and I had a short conversation with both of them, because they were working.</p>
<p>That’s the first time I met Bruce. And I guess he just took a liking to that record. Then what really cemented it
        was one night in 1982, he came to see us play at Big Man’s West and sat in with us, and we went out after and
        basically hung out the whole night, and just… you know, why do you become friends with a person? We just hit it
        off. Same age, same influences, sort of same upbringing, real working-class families.</p>

<script src="https://v0.wordpress.com/js/next/videopress-iframe.js?m=1674852142"></script>
<p><strong>Yeah. It’s easy to see. I mean, I don’t know Bruce, but just from what I know about you guys, I can see
            why you would click and become friends. It’s another thing, though, to collaborate the way you guys have.
            Bruce hasn’t really done that with that many people and certainly with no one outside of Steve to the extent
            that you guys have. I’d love to know a little bit more about your collaborating relationship. You guys wrote
            several songs together. How does that work?</strong></p>
<p>Well, the first one, I went out to Los Angeles. He invited me to Los Angeles, and we did “Chain Smokin’” and…</p>
<p><strong>“<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/04/03/meeting-across-the-river-joe-grushecky-and-bruce-springsteen-never-be-enough-time/">Never
                Be Enough Time</a>,” right?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah. “Never Be Enough Time,” and I played him a bunch of other songs, but they weren’t very good. I mean, like I
        said: I was almost flatlined. I had “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/05/25/matr-joe-grushecky-and-bruce-springsteen-chain-smokin/">Chain
            Smokin’,</a>” but the rest of the songs were very forgettable.</p>
<p>So when the sessions were coming to an end he said, “You know, you gotta write some better songs. The songs
        aren’t very good.” And he was right. They <em>weren’t</em> very good songs. He said, “You write so much better
        than this. These aren’t up to any kind of standard.” They were pretty lousy.</p>
<p>As fate would have it, I came home and we played a gig somewhere, and one of my old-time fans came up, and he
        handed me a book called <em>Homestead</em>.</p>
<p><strong>I was going to ask what prompted you to write that.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, he handed me a book called <em>Homestead</em>, and I start reading it. Especially the historical part about
        the strikes, and all that.</p>
<p>With the Iron City Houserockers, we had helped establish the first food bank in America, for steel workers. I
        think it was the first one, and actually Dan Rather did a story on us on CBS News. And through the years, I had
        become friends with the people who we helped out. So I was familiar with some of the guys, this guy Ron Wyden
        and Jay Weinberg and Mike Stout. They were the real–almost radical–end of the steel workers, the real pro-union
        guys when the whole thing was collapsing.</p>
<p>I read the book, and I think it mentioned Bruce. I’m sure it mentioned Bruce, because he became involved. It also
        mentioned us, it’s something we have in common.</p>
<p>I live in the South Hills of Pittsburgh, and every day when I’d go to work, I go through a tunnel. I had to cross
        the river in a tunnel, and I can remember coming out of this tunnel, and this song just came to me about
        Homestead. So I started writing it down, and in the meantime we were going to go to New York to finish those
        first two songs.</p>
<p>So I wrote these lyrics, but I just didn’t have any good music for him. I tried to come up with stuff, and it
        just wasn’t happening. So we finished recording “Chain Smokin’” and “Never Be Enough Time,” and  I thought, at
        least this is going to get me started again. Right at the end of our session, I pulled out the paper I had in my
        notebook and I said, “Hey, you know, if you feel like it… if you get the urge, here’s some lyrics. I think the
        lyrics are really good, but I don’t have any good music for it.”</p>
<p>So I get back to Pittsburgh, and I go to work. I used to work at a school where we had the worst-behaved kids in
        eighty different school districts. These kids were just terribly behaved. Most of them were criminals. I had a
        class of kids where everyone had a P.O. and you were with them all day long. They never changed classes. You had
        to eat with them, had to take them to the bathroom. It was unrelenting. There were no breaks. It was not a union
        job for us.</p>
<p>Well, I had been calling off. I was real honest with my supervisor, and I was telling her, “Well, I have a chance
        to go to Los Angeles to record with Bruce Springsteen, and then I have a chance to go to New York.” So I was
        working, but I was [paid next to nothing] to begin with, and this place was so wild to work in. I mean we were
        licensed to restrain. It was so crazy. They couldn’t keep anybody working there.</p>
<p>And if nothing else, I have a good work ethic. I showed up every day, I did my job, rarely missed. Anyway, so she
        calls me in the office, this is right before the weekend I go back, and she says “This is not coming from me,
        but the head honcho…” His name was… fuck was his name? First name was Dick. I remember, because he was a dick.
        (laughs)</p>
<p><strong>We probably want to protect the guilty anyway. [laughs]</strong></p>
<p>Yeah! [laughs] Anyways, he says, “If you go to work with Bruce Springsteen again, we’re firing you.” And I go,
        “What?? Fire me? Are you crazy? You can’t even get people to work here!” And I said, “I’m taking off without
        pay.”</p>
<p>But for some reason, he had it in for Bruce Springsteen. He did <em>not</em> like Bruce Springsteen, and he
        didn’t want me to work with Bruce Springsteen. For whatever reason, I never found out.</p>
<p>So the following weekend comes, and it’s Sunday night, and my wife comes and hands me the phone and says it’s
        Bruce. Bruce goes and starts playing “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/06/25/rotd-matr-joe-grushecky-and-bruce-springsteen-homestead/">Homestead</a>”
        on the phone. And I said, “Oh man, that’s <em>great</em>!” He said “we got to record this!” I said, “Oh, that’s
        fabulous! When?” He says, “Tuesday.”</p>
<p>So now I go into work on Monday. Monday night, I call in sick. Now I’m being a little bit sneaky instead of being
        honest, because who’s going to pass up the chance to do that? Lee Ann and I flew up to New York, and somebody
        picked us up and took us to Bruce’s in Jersey.</p>
<p>The next day we get up, and we’re working on a song in Bruce’s study. I had my mom and dad at home watching my
        kids, and in the midst of working on this song… I was a bit nervous, to tell you the truth, because Bruce was
        using Drop D tuning, and I was not familiar with it at that time. I couldn’t figure out what the hell he was
        playing! I should have just asked him, but I guess…I don’t know, I was almost overwhelmed because Bruce
        Springsteen is recording one of my songs that we’re writing together!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNH1lwkS-B8">Watch on Youtube: Homestead</a></p>
<p>So we’re going over the music that he wrote for this, and Patti comes into his study and she has the phone. (This
        is pre-cell phone days.) And it’s my mom. Patti said, “Your mom wants you to call. She just called and left a
        message.” So right away, you think the worst–you think that somethings wrong with the kids, blah blah blah,
        something’s terribly wrong.</p>
<p><strong>But you were busted!</strong></p>
<p>Yeah. [laughs] So I called, and she said “Joey,” (she always called me Joey) “Joey, you gotta call work right
        away.” And I said, “What’s wrong?” And my mom said, “If you don’t call them in fifteen minutes they’re firing
        you.” I said, “Get out!”</p>
<p>So I called, and Dick got on the phone and he says, “Where are you?” And I said, “Well, you know, I’m sick.” He
        says, “So why didn’t you answer the phone?” I said, “Well I was in the bathroom! I’m sick.” He said, “You’re not
        with Bruce Springsteen are you?” And Bruce is two feet away. I said, “No, I’m not at Bruce Springsteen’s. I’m
        home in Pittsburgh.” And then he made me come in with a doctor’s excuse, so I had to go to my buddy who was a
        doctor and tell him the whole story and get a doctor’s excuse. I ended up taking off three days of work just
        because I was pissed off then, instead of just doing what I had to do.</p>
<p><strong>That’s really funny. This is the kind of thing that makes me think of the butterfly effect, you know?
            Little things that have these big ripples. This guy, if you had listened to him, not only would your career
            have gone a different way….  If you look at Bruce’s career during the back half of the nineties, it’s pretty
            obvious that the work he did with you kind of led him down that <em><a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2023/06/03/album-companion-the-ghost-of-tom-joad/">Ghost
                    of Tom Joad</a> </em>path, because you can see a lot of parallels between “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/06/25/rotd-matr-joe-grushecky-and-bruce-springsteen-homestead/">Homestead</a>”
            and  “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2023/05/01/roll-of-the-dice-youngstown/">Youngstown</a>.” And
            then I remember reading that when he came off of that tour, he reconnected with you and you guys did “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/08/27/codeofsilence/">Code of Silence</a>” and “Another
            Thin Line.”</strong></p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p><strong>And that kind of bridged him back into his “rock voice.” And so… boy, if you had listened to that guy, it
            might have single-handedly derailed both of you guys.</strong></p>
<p>Luckily I didn’t listen to him. I still got a little rebellion left in me!</p>
<p><strong>I’m glad! [laughs]</strong></p>
<p>So I went in and asked for a leave of absence to go out on that October Assault. He wouldn’t let me take two
        weeks off! So I said, “Fuck that, I quit.” I quit right there. I said, “I even don’t know what’s wrong with you
        people.” Like I said, they couldn’t keep people there. Me and this other older guy, we had the worst of the
        worst. We had the most terribly behaved kids in the whole school, he and I together. All day long all by
        ourselves. And his son got really sick, and then his father got really sick, so he kept missing all kinds of
        work. And I was there by myself, basically holding the fort down and it was almost unspeakable.</p>
<p>They had something against Bruce Springsteen. I don’t know what it was.</p>
<p><strong>That’s crazy. Hey, can I ask you some questions about the album?</strong></p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p><strong>All right, let’s start with the title. One of the things that’s always struck me about <em>American
                Babylon</em> is that it’s like two albums in one. Half the songs are love songs, relationship songs. The
            other half are in the civic or political vein. You could have gone either way with it, but you went both.
            I’ve always thought that title tracks or titles make a statement about how you view the work. And you went
            with <em>American Babylon</em>. Why? What was the significance of that for you?</strong></p>
<p>Well, probably because of the job I was working in. The kids stole my car the other day. They did! They stole my
        car, they broke my car, the kids I was working with. I mean right off the bat that’s a true statement. And I
        just felt, my god, what’s the country coming to?” We had the Rodney King thing going on at that time, and we had
        just fought the Iraq war (the first one). It just seemed like everything was crazy, and I myself was intimately
        involved with in some cases horrific stories about maltreatment of children. I had a lot of kids who were just
        physically, mentally, sexually abused.</p>
<p>I actually wrote “No Strings Attached” and “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/12/11/matr-joe-grushecky-and-bruce-springsteen-american-babylon/">American
            Babylon</a>” on the same night. I came home, and I had a lot of slow songs. I thought, I gotta get some rock
        and roll stuff here. I was really excited by “American Babylon.” I thought I was on to something.</p>
<p>Before the final recording sessions in L.A., we recorded “American Babylon” here in Pittsburgh as a demo. Bruce
        heard it and said, “man, that’s the title.” I didn’t have a title up until then, and I was fishing for one.</p>
<p><strong>And that’s the one track that didn’t have Bruce’s involvement in it, right?</strong></p>
<p>No, because I was so excited when I wrote it! I went down to the studio with Rick Witkowski who I always worked
        with. And we did a version there, and it was just boom, boom, boom, one take–couple of overdubs for guitar stuff
        and that was it. That was the record. I hadn’t planned to do a finished master. I was excited about the song and
        I wanted to present it to Bruce. He heard it one time, and he said “Here’s your title track. There’s no reason
        to re-record that one.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it0MaZc8ewg">Watch on Youtube: American Babylon</a></p>
<p><strong>It’s funny you say that. I’m flashing back to <a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/05/22/have-a-good-time-but-get-out-alive/">our <em>Have
                    a Good Time</em> conversation</a> and how when you put those bonus tracks out there was that demo of
            “Don’t Let Them Push You Around” that was wildly different from the final version.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39gDr_UAxSU">Watch on Youtube: Dont Let Them Push You Around (Demo)</a>
</p>
<p><strong>Do you have any demos lying around of any of the <em>American Babylon</em> material that are
            significantly different in arrangement or sound compared to the final version?</strong></p>
<p>No, pretty much not. We were very efficient in that record. That’s the only song I cut somewhere else. So usually
        when we were doing the <em>American Babylon</em> stuff, it was just whatever I brought into the studio. The band
        usually had a pretty good idea of what I wanted to do, because we rehearsed it before we went, before we would
        go to Los Angeles. We wanted to make our time there as productive as possible.</p>
<p>With the stuff I did for MCA when I was on Cleveland International, they would actually give me a budget to go do
        demos, so I would go fish around in the studio. Sometimes I would write stuff right in the studio. It was a
        whole different approach, but the <em>American Babylon</em> record was pretty much planned out before we went. I
        mean, with regard to what songs we were going to do. I didn’t have a lot of… I wasn’t on a hot streak then. I
        didn’t have a lot of songs that I could just throw out there and see what was going to stick.</p>
<p><strong>Well, I know the order of recording. I know you started with “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/05/25/matr-joe-grushecky-and-bruce-springsteen-chain-smokin/">Chain
                Smokin’</a>” and “Never Be Enough Time”–which by the way, I think are two of your best songs.</strong>
</p>
<p>I’m really happy with both of those.</p>
<p><strong>I love the fact that “Chain Smokin’” <em>sounds</em> like someone chain smoking. It’s just… musically
            tremendous. </strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wQfzwQSSAU">Watch on Youtube: Chain Smokin'</a></p>
<p><strong>“Never Be Enough Time” has, I think, my single favorite lyric of yours–the Miracles and Temptations line,
            which I think is brilliantly clever in how it works on multiple levels. </strong><strong>I have trouble
            reconciling how strong those songs are with your statement–which I absolutely believe–but it’s mind-boggling
            to me that the rest of your songs were so (as you put it) sub-par. Why weren’t you able to uncork that
            bottled lightning?</strong></p>
<p>Well, “Chain Smokin’” was a song that I’d been playing around with for a while. I started taking some acoustic
        gigs, and I was never a “copy” guy. It never appealed to me, first of all, doing a whole night of  covers. And
        second of all, I was never very good at it. So I had been working on “Chain Smokin’” for a while, and I just
        thought it was a <em>really</em> good song.</p>
<p><strong>It is.</strong></p>
<p>“Never Be Enough Time” was actually a song that I recorded with the Iron City Houserockers on our last record,
        <em>Cracking Under Pressure</em>. We did a completely different version of it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qh3pAs3LMjM">Watch on Youtube: Joe Grushecky &amp; the Houserockers -
            Never Be Enough Time 1988</a></p>
<p>So I was playing those two acoustically when I went out to work with Bruce, and I had a couple other songs, but I
        was just glad that he picked those two.</p>
<p>We were just going to do “Chain Smokin’” initially. I knew I had one good song, and the rest of them weren’t very
        good. I can’t even remember what they were. I’m sure I got them stashed somewhere, but I played them. He said,
        “Well… you got anything else?”</p>
<p>So I played him “Never Been Enough Time.” And he <em>loved</em> it right off the bat. I said, “well, I already
        recorded this one.” But he said, “Let’s hear your version of it.” So I played him the version we did with the
        Iron City Houserockers, and then I played the version we were doing now and they were <em>really</em> different.
        And he said, “This is a great song.” I had a blast doing that one.</p>
<p><strong>You both sounded like you had a blast. I can <em>feel</em> you guys having so much fun there.</strong>
</p>
<p>Because we were face to face singing! All these vocals are live, you know. It was a stormy night in Los Angeles,
        and he had the skylights and the thunder and lightning was going off, and we’re just standing at this microphone
        going at it face-to-face.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Qe0HaOEKoM">Watch on Youtube: Joe Grushecky &amp; The Houserockers -
            Never Be Enough Time</a></p>
<p>But like I said, after I did those two, I knew I needed some better songs, because the ones that I had didn’t
        stand up. So that’s it, and I was fortunate enough to come up with “Homestead.” So I had a three-pack that was
        pretty good.</p>
<p><strong>By the way, Grzybowski is <em>not </em>an easy name to sing. Was that an Easter egg in “Homestead”? When
            I was doing research, I found a newspaper reference to a guy at Craig House, where you worked at the
            time…</strong></p>
<p>Named Grzybowski.</p>
<p><strong>Yeah! Is that…?</strong></p>
<p>His dad worked in Homestead.</p>
<p><strong>I was wondering where that name came from.</strong></p>
<p>Well, I grew up in a coal mining town. My family was all coal miners, both sides of the family. My dad dropped
        out of school when he was twelve years old to work in a coal mine. So he really… I don’t want to say
        <em>forced</em> me, but he highly encouraged me to get my education. That’s why I have a teaching degree. I
        would never have done it on my own.</p>
<p>The town we grew up in, the coal mines were dead by the time I was born in that particular area. So all the guys,
        all the Serbians and Italians, they all worked at Homestead. So in the summer, they’d have an open house, and
        they’d take us. My neighbors would take us down and say, “look where we work!”</p>
<p>It was horrifying. You’d see all this molten steel and the noise and the dirt, but everybody worked there. So I
        just picked his name out of a hat. I could have picked a lot of other ones. I just liked the way it sounded and
        it was so Pittsburgh: Grzybowski.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGL4zbzeclA">Watch on Youtube: Dark and Bloody Ground</a></p>
<p><strong>Yeah. It works. So you guys you did “Homestead,” and I think you did “Dark and Bloody Ground” at the same
            time?</strong></p>
<p>No… I don’t know if I have a… Do you have the sequence?</p>
<p><strong>I do. But I thought those two–</strong></p>
<p>We did “Homestead” in November at The Hit Factory, but the next songs we did after that were “Talk Show” and “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/09/05/matr-joe-grushecky-bruce-springsteen-and-patti-scialfa-comin-down-maria/">Comin’
            Down Maria.</a>” We did “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/06/27/matr-joe-grushecky-and-bruce-springsteen-only-lovers-left-alive/">Only
            Lovers Left Alive</a>,” too, but I ended up re-recording that one with the band.</p>
<p><strong>Okay… That’s not what I saw reflected in Brucebase, so this is new info. Brucebase has “Talk Show” and
            “Comin’ Down Maria” pinned to October ’94, almost a year later, with no mention of “Only Lovers Left Alive.”
            The chronology I have—and please correct me if I’m wrong—is October/November ’93, you guys did “Chain
            Smokin’” and “Never Be Enough Time,” and there was a February session in ’94 which I thought was
            “Homestead,” “Dark and Bloody Ground,” and “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2022/05/08/matr-joe-grushecky-and-bruce-springsteen-labor-of-love/">Labor
                of Love</a>.”</strong></p>
<p>No. “Comin’ Down Maria” and “Talk Show” were the next two we did. The Pirates had an All-Star game here in
        Pittsburgh–I took my son to the Home Run Derby, and the next day I flew to New Jersey when we worked on those
        two songs. We also did “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/06/27/matr-joe-grushecky-and-bruce-springsteen-only-lovers-left-alive/">Only
            Lovers Left Alive</a>,” which Bruce helped arrange and played a long guitar solo on, but ultimately I
        thought that should be a band song. When I recorded it later with the band, Bruce opted to sit that one out. I
        have an outtake of it somewhere, though.</p>
<p><strong>Okay, so this is July ‘94?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah. And then at some point we didn’t do anything for a while, and then March ’95, I went out with the band and
        we finished the record. I went back out in May and did overdubs.</p>
<p><strong>Okay, so July ’94 for “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/09/05/matr-joe-grushecky-bruce-springsteen-and-patti-scialfa-comin-down-maria/">Comin’
                Down Maria</a>,” “Talk Show” and the “Lovers” outtake, and then August for “Dark and Bloody Ground” and
            “Labor of Love”? Brucebase has those two and a few others pegged to August ’94.</strong></p>
<p>It wasn’t August. The next time we went out was in March of ‘95. It’d be before May, because May was my last
        session with Bruce. We basically finished the record in May. I went out in March with the band and we recorded.
        I brought “American Babylon” with me, and then we did all the rest of the record.</p>
<p><strong>And “Dark and Bloody Ground” is another one that you and Bruce wrote together, right?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. I’ll tell you the “Dark and Bloody Ground” story. We were recording “Homestead” at The Hit Factory, and the
        assistant engineer came up to me and said, “Hey, are you from Kentucky?” And I said no, why do you ask? He said,
        “Well the first line is <em>I was born in the corn fields of Kentucky</em> from “Homestead.”</p>
<p>I said, “This guy that I’m sort of building a character on is from Kentucky, and I’m just sort of telling his
        story along with all the people I knew back home that worked in Homestead. He said, “Did you ever hear of the
        Kentucky Cycle?” Have <em>you</em> ever heard of the Kentucky Cycle, written by Robert Schenkkan?</p>
<p><strong>I’m not familiar with it.</strong></p>
<p>Okay, well the Kentucky Cycle is a play that was on Broadway. It was a six-hour play, so it didn’t last too long,
        but it was about the struggle of land in Kentucky. In American history, the native Americans called Kentucky the
        dark and bloody ground, because people would fight over it. So in this play, it starts out white man against red
        man and goes on to the Civil War, the Hatfield-McCoy fights, the coal companies against the miners… It’s all
        this struggle, struggle, struggle.</p>
<p><strong>And you’re like, “six hours! I can do that in six minutes.”</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, right. [laughs] So anyways, for some reason I was aware of it. I had read about it. The play had come and
        gone already, but I was aware of the storyline and the play. Don’t ask me how, but I knew about it, and this is
        another one of these moments…</p>
<p>I get back after recording “Homestead” and I was working at night, like I said. I was working in the day with
        these emotionally needy kids, and then at night I was teaching people to get their GED. I was still doing it. I
        went back and they asked me to help for a while.</p>
<p>Oh, and another thing I’ve done over the years is I helped establish this library.</p>
<p>People don’t know about it, because it’s so far in the past, but I tell people this should have been the Joe
        Grushecky Memorial Library. They look at me like I’m crazy. We had all these books from the Catholic schools
        that were closing, and I went through thousands and thousands of books, got rid of the old textbooks and kept
        all the rest and started this library.</p>
<p>So I was sitting in a desk in this library where I taught GED, and it was my first night back from doing
        “Homestead,” and I walk in, and there’s the play sitting on my desk. Sitting right there in front of me and I
        said, “Holy shit!”</p>
<p>So I took the book home and read it before I gave it back. I probably should have kept it. Anyway, that became
        the basis of the song. So in my mind, Bruce had to do the music to that one, because of “Homestead.” It was sort
        of a similar situation. It tied things together for me mentally, so when we were doing the sessions, I gave him
        the lyrics and I said. “I got something here that I think would work great for us.”</p>
<p>I thought it would be logical. You know, he primarily did the music and I primarily did the lyrics on those two.
        So he wrote the music for that one. Actually, I got a tape of him singing it somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>That would be cool to hear someday!</strong></p>
<p>So that’s how that came about. And then we just sort of pieced the rest of the record together from the songs
        that I had written, and like I said, before we went out for the final sessions, I was determined to write some
        more rock and roll songs, because I was writing all these slower mid-tempo things.</p>
<p><strong>There are some really great up-tempo songs on that album. “No Strings Attached” is an awesome song. I
            love that song because it sounds from the title and the sound like it’s a casual hookup song, but it’s
            deeply romantic if you listen to it. That’s a great one.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hrohc583Gc">Watch on Youtube: No Strings Attached</a></p>
<p><strong>And then “Labor of Love,” of course. That’s a song that you had written on your own. Bruce doesn’t have
            any co-writing credit on that. Right?</strong></p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p><strong>And yet, there’s that whole mandolin part—</strong></p>
    [sings the mandolin part]
    <p><strong>–exactly! That shows up later in “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/01/05/roll-of-the-dice-land-of-hope-and-dreams/">Land of
                Hope and Dreams</a>.” When I first heard that I was like, “Whoa! That’s instantly recognizable.” Did he
            ask you if he could use that?</strong></p>
<p>That was just his bit to begin with. Bruce played that part on guitar and mandolin on “Labor of Love.” We trade
        ideas back and forth, so we both used it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSdpmShd7e4">Watch on Youtube: Labor of Love</a></p>
<p><strong>How did Patti’s contribution come about for “Comin’ Down Maria”?</strong></p>
<p>I just had that song. It was just Bruce and I recording it. And one of us (probably me) said, “Hey Patti, want to
        sit in on this?” So she came over.</p>
<p>“Comin’ Down Maria” and “Talk Show” are both just me and Bruce. We’re the only guys playing instruments on those.
        If there’s drum sets, it’s probably electronic drums somehow that we did, plus Patti singing on “Comin’ Down
        Maria.” The rest of the stuff is just he and I.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLshTQTt0Rg">Watch on Youtube: Comin' Down Maria</a></p>
<p><strong>Wait. I did not know that. I’m not sure <em>anybody </em>knows that, actually.</strong></p>
<p>Well… I don’t think at that point… [laughs sheepishly]
    </p>
<p>We didn’t actually want to say how much he had done on the record, because he’s pretty much all over it. He’s on
        every track except “No Strings Attached” and “American Babylon.” On every other song he is playing or singing or
        something.</p>
<p><strong>Huh. So, he’s on “Talk Show”?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, that’s <em>all</em> him.</p>
<p><strong>Wow. I did not know that.</strong></p>
<p>Well, <em>nobody</em> does. I’m spilling the beans. You’re the first guy to know.</p>
<p><strong>Ooh, I get to break an exclusive?</strong></p>
    [laughs] You know, I don’t say much about anything, but it’s been 25 years…
    <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2OCZHh7w_0">Watch on Youtube: Talk Show</a></p>
<p><strong>Okay, “Only Lovers Left Alive.” Like I said earlier, title tracks are interesting to me. Album sequences
            are interesting to me. That is a <em>dark</em> note to close that album on.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, well it’s sort of a dark record. It started with “Dark and Bloody Ground” and we have “American Babylon” in
        the middle and then “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/06/27/matr-joe-grushecky-and-bruce-springsteen-only-lovers-left-alive/">Only
            Lovers Left Alive</a>.” But I did purposely try to put in some lighter moments in with “No Strings Attached”
        and also “Labor of Love.”</p>
<p><strong>It’s really interesting to me that you see it as a dark album. I’ve always heard it as equal parts light
            and dark. I think it’s literally half and half, six and six. It feels very yin and yang, and I wondered
            whether that was deliberate. But it sounds like you think of it as a darker album–a dark album with some
            light songs.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah. I tried to lighten it up a little bit. I didn’t want people slitting their wrists listening to the record,
        but “Only Lovers Left Alive,” I was sitting on that title for years and years. I actually had a book called
        <em>Only Lovers Left Alive</em> when I was in high school, because I read that the Rolling Stones had licensed
        that book to make a movie. This is back when I was… this is early, like when the Stones first hit. I had the
        book for years and years. It probably just fell apart, it was a little paperback, and I always liked the title
        of it: <em>Only Lovers Left Alive</em>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JGAd81f--4">Watch on Youtube: Only Lovers Left Alive</a></p>
<p><strong>That’s a great title.</strong></p>
<p>So I fashioned a story. If you go back and listen to the record, there’s a lot of stuff about kids and families
        in that record.</p>
<p><strong>Yeah. It ends on a really ambiguous note, because is this kid going to follow in the footsteps of his
            father?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, and that’s a question I would always ask myself almost every day after work. Am I making a difference with
        these kids? Because some were so far gone, like I said. I had kids that… I don’t even want to tell you what
        happened to them, because they were so horribly abused and neglected. It was just unspeakable, some of the stuff
        that happened to these kids. And I’d always think, honestly, are they going to make it? And it’s always a
        thrill… actually one of them just popped up on my Facebook about two weeks ago, he was one of my favorites.</p>
<p><strong>Is he in a good place?</strong></p>
<p>You know, I always feel weird about following up on them, because you have to be respectful of their rights to
        privacy, but he has a business down in Florida. He has a wife, a couple of kids, so he seemed to be doing pretty
        good. Most of the kids that I run into that I’ve worked with always thank me for helping them because I would
        always tell them, the moment I let you do anything that you want to do, that means I don’t care. I said, “I care
        enough about you to correct your bad behavior.” I would always tell them.</p>
<p><strong>I think I told you last time we talked. My wife’s a special ed teacher and she has these crises of
            confidence sometimes, like how do I know if what I’m doing matters? If it’s going to make a difference? And
            we’re always like, “You’ll know way down the line.” Or you know any day you open up the paper and there’s
            not like an article written about a kid being shot or in jail or whatever, but that’s kind of the way you
            know, I guess for the time being.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah. When I first started, I worked with really severely disabled mentally and physically handicapped kids. I
        mean severely institutionalized. I could see results with them, because I was teaching them how to eat, how to
        go to the bathroom and stuff. So I could see results, but when I was working this job, when I was doing
        <em>American Babylon</em>, it was just like these really terribly abused and neglected kids and they acted out
        all day long. So you’re saying, “Oh my God.” It was relentless, but a lot of them have contacted me later in
        life, and it always gives me a boost to know that they are doing well.</p>
<p><strong>I’m glad you have that. Hey, I know we’ve been talking a long time now, but just a couple more questions
            I’d like to ask you–I guess the big one is, looking back on this, why <em>didn’t</em> this album become the
            monster it should have been?</strong></p>
    [laughs] I don’t know… I mean why didn’t <em>Have a Good Time But Get Out Alive</em> become the monster it should’ve
    been? I mean, you got to have everything going. You got to have the good agents. We couldn’t find a good agent. We
    couldn’t get on a good tour. We had no money behind us. Nobody could afford to quit their job and go at it full
    time. You have to have everything firing all at the same time.
    <p><strong>It’s just mind-boggling to me. I mean… jeez, you even had Bruce out on tour with you!</strong></p>

<p><strong>Do you ever look back on it and go, “Boy, if we had done this or tried this maybe…” Or do you think it
            was just kind of the cards that were just dealt at the time?</strong></p>
<p>I think on this one it was probably the cards were dealt at the time. I mean we couldn’t have done much more than
        we did given our situation. Like I said, we’ve never had the luxury of not working. Everybody in our band had a
        day gig. I mean we <em>still</em> have day gigs. Everybody in my band works, and we just were  never able to
        crack through in a big way. We never got that big radio song.</p>
<p><strong>I don’t know, man. You certainly had at least a half dozen of them on the album.</strong></p>
<p>Well, according to <em>you</em>, but… [laughs]
    </p>
<p><strong>I told you at the top of the call the reason that this album means so much to me is at that point in my
            life I felt like music had pretty much left me behind. What I loved about rock and roll… it seemed like
            nobody was doing it at the time. It was just going in a totally different direction. I had just moved to the
            Northwest and everything was all grunge and it just never resonated with me.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, I never got behind grunge at all.</p>
<p><strong>And then even Bruce was going in a different direction, but then your album came out. I was like, “Yes!
            This is rock and roll.” And what was great about it is that it was fresh. It didn’t sound dated, and it
            sounded like rock. And it felt like rock that nobody else was making at the time. I only wish I had been
            able to catch you guys on that tour.</strong></p>
<p>Oh, it’s a great album. I mean I can still… on any given night we play a ton of songs off it. “Homestead” is
        probably one of the best songs I ever wrote.</p>
<p><strong>It is. It’s fantastic. I don’t know why Bruce doesn’t play it more often, or at all really.</strong></p>
<p>Bruce has a version of it. You heard that, right, on E Street Radio?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmmxYCR52rY">Watch on Youtube: Bruce Springsteen - HOMESTEAD Rare Studio
            Recording Joe Grushecky 2013</a></p>
<p><strong>I <em>have</em> heard it, but live, I mean–you guys have done it live together, but I don’t think he’s
            played it on his own without you, or with the band at all.</strong></p>
<p>Did you hear the “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2021/03/12/rotd-matr-joe-grushecky-and-bruce-springsteen-idiots-delight/">Idiot’s
            Delight</a>” he did?</p>
<p><strong>[Blogger’s Note: Bruce and Joe wrote “Idiot’s Delight” together.] I did! I did, when he played it on his
            radio show recently. I was like, hello! Where did <em>you</em> come from?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiQ5QgBUUAg">Watch on Youtube: Bruce Springsteen - Idiot's Delight</a>
</p>
<p><strong>So the last question I have… well, you emailed me a month or so back and asked if  I knew how many times
            you and Bruce had played together, and I sent you a list of 53 times. Did you even realize that it had been
            that many times?</strong></p>
<p>No, I didn’t!</p>
<p><strong>That’s a lot of times.</strong></p>
<p>The reason I e-mailed, we were having some type of discussion sitting on my patio with my wife and kids about how
        many times I’ve played with Bruce, and I said I had written a bunch of them down when we first started, but then
        I got lax, so I had no idea. I figured you must’ve known because shortly after, you put out that little blurb
        about, was it “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/06/12/matr-joe-grushecky-and-bruce-springsteen-talking-to-the-king/">Talking
            to the King</a>?”</p>
<p><strong>Yeah.</strong></p>
<p>So I said if anybody would know, Ken would know. Actually, I’m very glad I have that.</p>
<p><strong>Hopefully you have recordings of all those times too because if not…</strong></p>
<p>You can send me anything you want. [laughs] I’d be glad to have it.</p>
<p><strong>Cool. I’m curious though: so you guys definitely have some reliables that you play together, both from
            your catalog and his. Who chooses the Springsteen songs that you include, you or him? Do you have favorite
            songs that you guys like to play?</strong></p>
<p>Well I try to… I rehearse the band, and I try to pick songs that I think my band could do justice to. Obviously,
        the big saxophone solos are not something that we could do in an appropriate fashion. And some of the songs that
        I like to hear, I present them to Bruce. And he picks the ones he wants to play and then occasionally he’ll say,
        “Well, let’s do <em>this</em> one.” That’s why we started to do [singing] <a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2019/07/16/roll-of-the-dice-save-my-love/"><em>save my love for
                you</em></a>. We started doing that one.</p>

            the Houserockers-Save My Love</a></p>
<p><strong>Yeah. And you guys did “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/02/12/roll-of-the-dice-frankie-fell-in-love/">Frankie
                Fell in Love.</a>” I think you guys were the first ones to play both of those.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah. We were the first ones. I think I suggested that because it had that Stones vibe. I’m a big Stones fan.</p>

<p><strong>That’s such a great song. I was wondering what the dynamic was there. It’s funny because he blends right
            into your band.</strong></p>
<p>Oh yeah…</p>
<p><strong>I mean yes, the audience will fixate on him because he’s Bruce Springsteen, but sonically it’s like he’s
            part of the band.</strong></p>
<p>People have asked me what it’s like playing with Bruce Springsteen. I say it’s just like having Roberto Clemente
        on your team or Mickey Mantle. Or Joe Montana. You are a better team.</p>
<p><strong>Alright, so absolutely last question, I promise. You guys did a big blitz for <em>Have A Good Time</em>.
            This is kind of a milestone anniversary and a milestone record. Anything you guys have planned?</strong></p>
<p>We’re working on it. We’re in the midst of recording a new record, also.</p>
<p><strong>I’m <em>so</em> glad to hear that!</strong></p>
<p>I got some really good songs that I was excited about, and this pandemic just brought everything to a screeching
        halt. We’ve done some live-in-the-studio filming that we’re going to throw out there.</p>
<p><strong>Yeah, I saw the video you guys did the other day. I bookmarked it to make sure because I was actually out

<p>And then next year we have the 40th anniversary of <em>Blood on the Bricks</em>. I’m gonna start working on it at
        some point, because I do have outtakes for that one. Like I said, I had the luxury of going in the studio for a
        couple of weeks. It cost us… I mean the budgets were $75,000, $80,000 in those days. A thousand dollars would go
        a long way in Pittsburgh. So we could go book a studio for a couple of weeks for a thousand dollars and we would
        just go there and do our… I always come in with songs and say, “Listen to this one, listen to this.” And then
        we’ll work them out in the studio and then we would present them to the producers or in this case, with
        <em>Blood in the Bricks</em>, it was Steve Cropper. He actually came into Pittsburgh and we did probably six,
        eight days of pre-production. So we rehearsed every day for six to eight hours with him.</p>
<p><strong>So 40 years is the magic number for getting some anniversary love, or can we look forward to something
            for American Babylon’s 25th?</strong></p>
    [laughs] I’ll tell you, American Babylon… that’s a hell of an album, man!
    <p><strong>It is!</strong></p>
<p>It’s a great record.</p>
<p><strong>I know, that’s why you gotta do <em>something</em>! I mean, maybe you can’t tour right now, but you’ve
            got to do <em>something. </em>Cleveland International has been doing such a great job of promoting
            the <em>Have a Good Time</em> anniversary… I know American Babylon wasn’t on that label originally, but
            maybe…?</strong></p>
<p>Well, the reason we were able to do so much stuff with <em>Have a Good Time But Get Out Alive</em> is that
        Cleveland Entertainment got back online, so we’re hooking up with Steve Popovich Jr. and Cleveland International
        again. We have several projects we are working on. I wanted to find a home for all my music, so it feels right
        to be working with Steve. It feels I’ve come full circle. More to come…</p>
<p><strong>Well, here’s hoping! </strong><b>You got a whole bunch of great albums, man. Please keep adding to them,
            and hopefully we will get a chance to meet up in person at a show sometime. When you guys are back on the
            road I’ll be there.</b></p>
<p>Well, I saw you at the last Light of Day, right? You were on stage.</p>
<p><strong>I was. I’m so glad I did that, too, because that was <em>this year, </em>2020.</strong></p>

<p><strong>It’s <em>crazy</em> that was this year. It just seems like it was <em>forever</em> ago.</strong></p>
<p>Well, it’s going to be virtual next year. Nobody’s opening back up.</p>
<p><strong>How do you… When will you feel ready, do you think? What would it take for you to feel okay going back

<p>You know, I don’t even know. Probably a vaccine. I had pneumonia a couple years ago, so…</p>
<p><strong>Yeah, you don’t want to chance that.</strong></p>
<p>No.</p>
<p><strong>It’s going to be a long… a friend of mine who works at Google just sent me a link today that they just

</p>
<p>Yeah, I heard that today too.</p>
<p><strong>Feels like we’re all going to have to get pretty inventive for a while in our entertainment
            options.</strong></p>
<p>Well, we need some leadership. They need to shut the country, the whole place down. I’m old, but they’re talking
        about going back to school…</p>
<p><strong>We have a shared vested interest, because two people in my house are teachers.</strong></p>
<p>It’s frightening. I can’t believe they’re even discussing it.</p>
<p><strong>It’s infuriating, because I mean if we had the leadership to just say, “Look, we’re going to give you
            guys a week or two-week notice. We’re going to go into lockdown—the whole country. Stock up your food. Do
            what you need to do. Make your preparations and then just hunker down.” We get through it. Right?</strong>
</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>But no one wants to just come to terms with that, and it seems like a lot of folks are going to die and a

            will.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Anyway… that’s a dark note to end on! Although I guess it’s appropriate for <em>American Babylon</em>.
            [laughs]</strong></p>
<p>Well… [laughs] what’s more <em>American Babylon</em> than a fricking pandemic and a depression at the same time?

<h2>Spare Parts: Warren Zevon: Jeannie Needs a Shooter</h2><div><h3>Originally Published: October 23, 2020</h3></div>
<p>This is an odd one.</p>
<p>“Jeannie Needs a Shooter” isn’t entirely a Springsteen original, and it’s certainly not a cover. Bruce doesn’t
        perform on the track, either, so how are we to classify it? Good thing we have a “Spare Parts” category!</p>
<p>If only we could authoritatively unravel Bruce’s specific contributions we’d be set, but accounts of the creation
        of Warren Zevon’s “Jeannie Needs a Shooter” are both colorful and contradictory.</p>
<p>Let’s see how we do.</p>
<p>Bruce recorded a song called “Janey Needs a Shooter” in early 1973, and he’s only just now getting around to
        releasing it on <em>Letter to You</em>, 47 years later (albeit as a new 2019 recording with the E Street Band).
    </p>
<p>“Janey Needs a Shooter” is a terrific early (and now recent) E Street Band performance, and if you’d like to read
        my full analysis of it, check out my earlier article <a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/07/27/roll-of-the-dice-janey-needs-a-shooter/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Suffice to say, it’s a great song with many fans, including one Warren Zevon.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuoD-d0jblk">Watch on Youtube: Bruce Springsteen - Janey Needs A
            Shooter</a></p>
<p>Well, sort of.</p>
<p>Turns out Zevon never actually heard the song–just the title, which Jon Landou had mentioned off-hand in a
        conversation with Zevon during the period between <em>Born to Run</em> and <em>Darkness on the Edge of
            Town</em>. But as far as Zevon was concerned, it was love at first sight; he was completely ensorcelled by
        the title, envisioning an Old West tale of an outlaw courting the sheriff’s daughter.</p>
<p>Of course that wasn’t <em>remotely</em> what “Janey Needs a Shooter” was about, but Zevon’s obsession was off and
        running. To be fair, he did try to wheedle and cajole Bruce into playing the song for him, but Bruce never
        obliged. Given Bruce’s liberal use of Western imagery in his early songwriting, it’s hard to fault Zevon for his
        assumption.</p>
<p>Here’s where the story may start to verge into apocryphal territory.</p>
<p>Reportedly, Bruce grew so tired of Warren’s incessant pleas to hear the song that in exasperation, he finally
        told Warren to go write it himself.</p>
<p>Zevon did just that. He got as far as the first verse and the title (which he’d misheard the entire time as
        “Jeannie” instead of “Janey”) before excitedly dashing over to Bruce’s house, waking him up from a nap on the
        sofa in order to play it for him. (Other accounts have Warren inviting Bruce over to his own house for the
        reveal.)</p>
<p>Bruce complimented Warren on the verse and asked where the rest of the song was. He soon found out: with a fish
        on his hook, Warren reeled in Bruce’s help to finish the song.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53WwqdrUtvQ">Watch on Youtube: Jeannie Needs a Shooter</a></p>
<p>Just how extensive that help was varies by account from a collaborative effort to Bruce simply finishing the song
        on his own.  To the best of my knowledge, I’ve not seen a first-hand account that definitively answers the
        question.</p>
<p>For what it’s worth, though, Bruce is listed first on the songwriting credit, although that may simply be an
        alphabetical matter.</p>
<p>Zevon released “Jeannie Needs a Shooter” on his fourth album, <em>Bad Luck Streak in Dancing School, </em>and it
        quickly became a fan favorite.</p>
<p>Oh, and Bruce finally did play the original “Janey Needs a Shooter” for Warren once they’d finished their
        collaborative version, and only then did Warren sheepishly realize how far afield he’d strayed in his
        interpretation.</p>
<p>And that’s (more or less) the story of how we ended up with two very different but similarly named songs with
        some common DNA between them, recorded by two different legendary artists in their own particular style, with
        both songs turning out spectacularly.</p>
<p>I gotta say, though: for two reportedly good friends, if the story above is anywhere close to true, that young
        Bruce Springsteen was either a really annoying friend (like, just play the song, dude!) or a really good mentor.
    </p>
<p>It’s hard to say which.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">“It was very personal the way I took [“Atlantic

                and you know the outcome is kind of bad for you, but you have to do it because you have no choice, but
                there’s always a hope … you have to go through that, you have to accept it and you have to keep going
                because there is a lot of things worth living for. Maybe at first you don’t see this and you don’t see
                any other options, but if you think about it a little more deeply and try to start to believe in
                yourself, other people around you you will def start seeing that there are a lot of things to live for.”
                — Arty, <em>Billboard</em>, October 10, 2017</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bruce Springsteen has visited many genres over the course of his career, but electronic dance music is one that
        he’s left untouched… until recently.</p>
<p>In 2017, Bruce got his first byline on an EDM single, but it happened by way of a Russian DJ named Artyom
        Stoliarov, who goes by the stage name Arty.</p>
<p>Arty grew up in post-Soviet Russia–not exactly a major market for Bruce. But when Arty started charting in the
        U.S. around the turn of the decade, he started touring America. That’s when he discovered Bruce Springsteen. And
        by “discovered,” I mean he became fascinated.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>“If you look at his live shows, it’s insane. There is so much energy for a
            concert that goes up three to four hours and there is just Bruce Springsteen singing the songs, completely
            controlling the crowd and they love it. There is no bigger inspiration than that.”</em></p>
<p>Arty dove into Bruce’s catalog and became particularly enchanted with “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/06/04/roll-of-the-dice-atlantic-city/">Atlantic City</a>.”
        It spoke to him, and he adapted it into a new song, “Supposed to Be.”</p>
<p>The first thirty seconds of “Supposed to Be” are clearly lifted from “Atlantic City,” but after that the song
        becomes Arty’s own.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXP7RdiAWTI">Watch on Youtube: ARTY - Supposed To Be (Official
            Audio)</a></p>
<p>Still, Arty insisted on (and succeeded at) getting Bruce’s blessing to use his song, and the result is Bruce’s
        first songwriting credit (co-writer, to be precise) for an EDM song.</p>

<h2>Becoming The Boss: A Bruce Springsteen Board Game</h2><div><h3>Originally Published: February 26, 2021</h3></div>
<p>I didn’t know the world needed a Springsteen-themed board game, but Søren Kitaj and Knud Jønsson did.</p>
<p><img alt="" height="569" id="25242" src="https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_4631-scaled.jpg" width="758"/></p>
<p>These two lifelong friends from Denmark envisioned, designed, developed, and published <em><a href="https://becomingtheboss.dk/">Becoming The Boss</a>, </em>an incredibly detailed–and
        <strong>free</strong> to all–board game experience sure to intrigue even casual Springsteen fans and absolutely
        delight hardcore ones.</p>
<p><a href="https://videopress.com/embed/GSg17dc4">Watch Video Highlight</a></p>
<p>In <em>Becoming The Boss, </em>players get to live (or relive) the early days of the Asbury Park music scene. To
        win the game, all you have to do is form a band, claw your way to the top, score a record deal, and make the
        covers of <em>Time </em>and <em>Newsweek. </em>You know: just like Bruce did.</p>
<p>But despite its name and inspiration, it would be a misrepresentation to classify the game purely as Bruce
        biography. In <em>Becoming The Boss</em>, Søren and Knud have crafted a loving tribute to the entire Jersey
        Shore music scene of the early 1970s. With its vivid cast of characters chasing their dreams across a romantic
        landscape of legendary locales, the mythology of the Jersey Shore translates perfectly to the gaming table.</p>
<p>All the major players are included…</p>
<p><img alt="" height="989" id="25525" src="https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/playersteve.png" width="758"/></p>
<p>…and the supporting players, too.</p>
<p><img alt="" height="976" id="25524" src="https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/player-vini.png" width="758"/></p>
<p>Even the obscure but notable local legends are present, rewarding actual or spiritual habitues of the early
        Asbury music scene.</p>
<p><img alt="" height="968" id="25523" src="https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/player-margaret.png" width="758"/></p>
<p><em>Becoming The Boss</em> is incredibly rich in detail, accessible to uninitiated but chock full of detail,
        arcana, in-jokes, and lore sure to please the hardcore Springsteen fan.</p>
<p>“It will never be the family board game of the year,” laughs co-creator Knud Jønsson.</p>
<p>But that’s by design.</p>
<p>Søren and Knud have been friends since high school. Their professional paths couldn’t have been more
        divergent–Søren works in corporate communications while Knud is a researcher of bird evolution at the University
        of Copenhagen–but their shared passion for Bruce’s music and their appreciation for its circumstances of origin
        has been a continual core of their friendship over the years.</p>
<p>They went to their first gig when the Reunion Tour came to Germany in 1999 (Knud was wearing his souvenir
        tee-shirt from that show when we spoke), and as with much of E Street Nation, that first taste of live
        Springsteen led to an everlasting addiction.</p>
<p>They attended more shows together, schooled themselves on Bruce’s life and music, and eventually–inevitably–they
        made the pilgrimage to Asbury Park. Making the most of their trip to the U.S. during the River Tour, Søren and
        Knud took a side trip to Asbury and Atlantic City (“and Flemington!” Søren adds), and the landscape of their
        imagination came to life.</p>
<p>They made a subsequent trip in 2018 to see <em>Springsteen on Broadway</em>, and they even managed every fan’s
        dream: they caught a surprise Bruce appearance at the Wonder Bar when Bruce showed up to dance with his mom one
        stormy April day.</p>
<p>Reminiscing on a late spring day about a year and half ago, Knud made an off-hand comment that Bruce’s escape
        from New Jersey might make for a great board game. Søren immediately latched on to the possibility and refused
        to let it go: “That is actually a <em>very</em> good idea.”</p>
<p>They envisioned the basic structure of the game that same evening: the proximity of Asbury Park’s famous locales
        to each other made for a natural, classic board game layout, and as far as gameplay went, Søren and Knud were
        inspired by the trailer parks, supermarket openings, and all the small venues the local artists played on their
        long upward climb. They planned an experience centered around earning a reputation via band battles and
        songwriting, and by the end of the evening what started as a lark had become a commitment.</p>
<p><img alt="" height="533" id="25529" src="https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/gigs.png" width="758"/></p>
<p>They were also inspired by Bruce’s internal struggles, sensitively incorporating his depression and dark days
        into the gameplay as well. And they knew Bruce’s early sojourn in California and eventual arrival in New York
        City had to be included, too.</p>
<p>In short: they put the story first, and the gameplay second. They admit to having been asked, can’t you make the
        game generic? <em>Becoming a Rock Star</em>, maybe? “No we cannot,” says Knud. “That is not the game we are
        making.”</p>
<p>Still, as Søren notes, “It was important to us not to not give any advantage to those who know him better than
        others,” so while devoted fans will likely derive more enjoyment from the game, when it comes to gameplay, even
        the uninitiated have a fighting chance to win the game. There’s a fair bit of strategy required, but just like
        in Asbury Park at the time, “you need a bit of luck and magic to make it happen.”</p>
<p>The basic game came together quickly. Like Bruce’s classic albums, though, refining the gameplay took more than a
        year. “We very quickly had down what we needed,” said Knud, “and then the rest of it has just been playing the
        game over and over and finding out, oh man you win every time if you do this, we need to do something about it.
        All little changes and refining, what outtakes should be in, what non-E Street members should be in…” Søren
        concurs: “Ninety percent of it came quick, but the last ten percent took a lot of time.”</p>
<p>Some of the simplifications were painful, but the guys kept their focus on the balance between lore and gameplay.
        Says Knud: “The last six months were basically us asking: can we make it simpler? Easier? For example, the first
        battle of the bands was immensely complex. You had to flip coins like 25 times to find out who won.”</p>
<p>The game was released in January after a total of eighteen months in development, and it’s free to all, a gift to
        E Street Nation from Søren and Knud. You can play it simply by downloading and printing the materials and
        assembling a few household items.</p>
<p>Plan to spend as much time playing the game as you would at an E Street Band concert, though. Two players will
        take about three hours to make it through the game. Søren and Knud once played with four and didn’t quite finish
        even after five hours. But Bruce didn’t take the shortcut to success, so why should players?</p>
<p>When asked if they’d ever considered abbreviating the game for, say, one-hour gameplay, Knud flatly answered,
        “No. That is not the game we are trying to make. It’s not for people who think ‘Born in the U.S.A.’ is
        Springsteen’s best track. It’s for people who think it’s a lot of fun when you pull up that event card” and
        understand the reference.</p>
<p><img alt="" height="245" id="25527" src="https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/inspiration.png" width="758"/></p>
<p>Still, the guys admit to taking a few designers’ prerogatives, particularly with the subjective ratings assigned
        to the songs and characters. I told them I noticed that and had a bone to pick: how could they give “New York
        City Serenade” only three stars out of five?</p>
<p><img alt="" height="243" id="25528" src="https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/wildinnocent.png" width="758"/></p>
<p>“We’d like to give them <em>all</em> five stars, but we need a certain balance, that’s part of the game!”
        defended Søren. “If we gave it three stars, we of course didn’t think it was one of his best tracks, but it’s
        subjective, our opinion.”</p>
<p>Still, if players disagree with the gamemakers’ ratings, they have their blessing to change them. In fact,
        Søren expects and hopes for some debate about their ratings on the game’s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/becomingtheboss/">Facebook page</a>.</p>
<p>When I asked the guys if there will be a sequel, they demurred. “We’re not going to do a Bob Dylan one, or a Neil
        Young one.” So unlike their hero, Søren and Knud are happy being one-hit wonders.</p>
<p>My last question for the guys was perhaps the most important one: can <em>Becoming the Boss</em> be played
        virtually? Because if so, quarantine may have just become a little less tedious.</p>
<p>They glanced at each other and shrugged. “Why not? We haven’t considered that, to be honest.”</p>
<p>Which only leaves one lingering question in my mind: anyone up for a game?</p>

<h2>Spare Parts: Lorenzo Bertocchini: Hey Bruce</h2><div><h3>Originally Published: April 21, 2021</h3></div>
<p>I’ve featured Lorenzo Bertocchini’s Springsteen covers before, and I’ll almost certainly do so again. The
        challenge is narrowing the selection: Not only are his renditions both fresh and very well done, Lorenzo also
        dives deep–<em>very </em>deep–into Bruce’s catalog.</p>
<p>From deep cuts like “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/11/15/roll-of-the-dice-when-youre-alone/">When You’re
            Alone</a>” to outtakes like <a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/12/09/cover-me-lorenzo-bertocchini-and-elizabeth-lee-be-true/">his
            wonderful duet with Elizabeth Lee</a> on “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2020/12/02/roll-of-the-dice-be-true/">Be True</a>” to unreleased
        gems like “Sugarland,” Lorenzo obviously has an encyclopedic appreciation of Bruce’s body of work.</p>
<p>That knowledge is on dizzying display in Lorenzo’s original song/shaggy dog story, “Hey Bruce,” which caps off
        his tribute album, <em>Hearts of Stone</em>. I won’t say much about it other than: it’s clever, catchy, and
        warrants close attention, because at times the in-jokes and easter eggs fly by faster than I can count.</p>

<h2>Spare Parts: What I Did on My Autumn Vacation</h2><div><h3>Originally Published: October 24, 2021</h3></div>
<p>Hello again!</p>
<p>You might have noticed I took this past week off, although my definition of “off” apparently means only
        publishing one blog post a day instead of two, along with filing a couple of special reports for Backstreets.
    </p>
<p>As promised, the <em>Roll of the Dice, Cover Me, and Meeting Across the River</em> series resume as of tomorrow,
        but I thought I’d take a moment to share highlights from what I’ve been up to this past week.</p>
<p>Last Sunday, I visited the <em>Bruce Springsteen Live! </em>exhibit at the Grammy Museum Experience in Newark.
        Curated, designed and presented by the Bruce Springsteen Archives and Center for American Music, the exhibit is
        a delight for any true Springsteen fan. Display cases are filled with artifacts familiar and new…</p>
<p><img alt="" height="569" id="30421" src="https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_1783-rotated.jpeg" width="758"/></p>
<p><img alt="" height="1011" id="30422" src="https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_1784.jpeg" width="758"/></p>

<p><img alt="" height="1011" id="30424" src="https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_1786.jpeg" width="758"/></p>
<p>…and the interactive stations are a treat, too. Visitors learn how Bruce constructs his encore sets and  get to
        try their hand it at themselves. And in a series of brand new interviews, Bruce and the E Streeters discuss how
        they prepare for touring and reminisce about iconic shows. (I was particularly gratified to learn that Bruce
        shares my concern that his shows start right around what has become bedtime these past few years. I guess if he
        can train himself to stay up late when he hits the road, I can too.)</p>
<p>It takes about two hours to experience the entirety of the exhibit, but if you’re a U.S. west coaster you might
        just want to wait: the exhibit is due to make its way to the main Grammy Museum in L.A., where it will be more
        than twice the size.</p>
<p>It was just a one-hour drive from the museum to Asbury Park, where I attended the special <em>Between the
            Lines</em> event that same afternoon with Bruce, Stevie, and a star-studded supporting cast to benefit <a href="https://teachrock.org/">TeachRock,</a> an organization I’ve been proud to support for years.</p>
<p>This was a strict no-filming event, so I don’t have any video to share–but the good news is that it was
        professionally filmed, so hopefully everyone will have a chance to watch it someday soon. In the meantime, check
        out my <a href="https://backstreets.com/news.html#BTL">Backstreets review</a> for highlights.</p>
<p>A few days later, I was in New York City for the annual Robin Hood benefit gala, where Bruce made an appearance
        to play three songs and stuck around to congratulate Paul McCartney, who received a special award from the
        foundation. And this time filming was permitted, so enjoy Bruce’s performance below, along with my Backstreets
        report <a href="https://www.backstreets.com/news.html#rhf">here</a>.</p>

<p>The next day, on my way back from New York, I stopped by Monmouth University to visit the <a href="https://springsteenarchives.org/">Springsteen Archives</a>, located in an unimposing small house on
        campus. The house may be cozy, but each of its rooms are filled to the brim with artifacts, clippings, and other
        items of historic significance–over 35,000 holdings in all, with more arriving on a regular basis.</p>
<p><img alt="" height="1011" id="30425" src="https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_1852.jpeg" width="758"/></p>
<p>The Archives aren’t open for drop-ins, but you can make an appointment to visit. There’s no entrance fee, but
        keep in mind that this is a working archival facility, not a museum. If you don’t know what you’re looking for,
        you’re likely to be overwhelmed.</p>
<p>The coolest thing I saw during my visit? This iconic hat. If you recognize it, you can imagine my reaction.</p>
<p><img alt="" height="654" id="30420" src="https://estreetshuffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_1844.jpeg" width="758"/></p>
<p>I’m already planning to spend a couple more days in the Archives newspaper and periodicals room in the near
        future to help flesh out next year’s Kingdom of Day’s posts. If you’re interested in checking it out too, read
        this <a href="https://springsteenarchives.org/faq/">FAQ page</a> for instructions and expectations.  My deep
        thanks to Eileen Chapman and Tim Cabrey for a wonderful introductory visit.</p>
<p>I also had a chance to take Stan Goldstein and Jean Mikle’s outstanding <a href="https://www.njrockmap.com/">Rock
            and Roll Tour of the Jersey Shore</a> while I was in the neighborhood. I’d been on the tour once before a
        few years ago, but there’s too much history in the Asbury area to fit in a single day. I saw a few new (to me)
        sights, had lunch at Federici’s in Freehold, met some cool Spring-Nuts, and had a chance to talk with original E
        Street Band drummer “Mad Dog” Vini Lopez for a bit and hear some great stories. (Vini was a special guest on the
        tour.) Highly recommended if and when you find yourself in or around Asbury Park sometime.</p>
<p>It’s been a great week, but it’s time to get back to work. Thanks for sticking around while I enjoyed a change of
        scenery. Regular content resumes tomorrow.</p>

<p>I know, I know.</p>
<p>I sure do take vacations an awful lot these days, don’t I?</p>
<p>But this one’s short–only two days–and once again it’s a working vacation, because I’ve been covering events and
        writing for Backstreets. (Current events coverage doesn’t really fit the format here.) And as
        always, <em>Kingdom of Days</em> never skips a beat, so technically the daily commitment continues.</p>
<p>And because I love you, I brought you back something!</p>
<p>This past Monday night, I attended Stand Up For Heroes in New York City, my third time at the annual Bob Woodruff
        Foundation benefit for veterans and their families. and my favorite time as well.</p>
<p>Bruce performed four songs (all with dirty jokes serving as introductions), including the public debut of “Letter
        to You”
        and an ultra-rare acoustic “Hungry Heart.” I
        captured his entire set on video, and I think they came out great. Enjoy them below:</p>

    </p>
<p>As this piece publishes, I’m on my way to Pittsburgh to catch Joe Grushecky and The Houserockers at a special
        hometown concert to celebrate the release of the new 25th Anniversary edition of <em>American
            Babylon</em>. The show is tonight, and thanks to Little Steven’s Underground Garage, you can watch
        it for free from the comfort of your own home. Join Joe and the band (and me in the audience!) <a href="https://www.facebook.com/undergroundgarage">here</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, also by the time this sees print, my review of the aforementioned AB25 deluxe edition should be up on
        Backstreets News. I can’t recommend the album highly enough, and there’s <a href="https://backstreets.com/news.html#AB25">some pretty cool breaking Bruce news in my review</a> that
        you’re going to want to check out. (Apple Music subscribers, make sure you block off Friday at 5pm Eastern on
        your calendars!)</p>
<p>That’s all for now, but I’ll be back tomorrow with a couple more special treats. (So maybe this isn’t really a
        break after all?)</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks for sticking with me while I moonlight a bit. I’ll be back home and blogging away again in a
        couple of days–look for a new <em>Roll of the Dice</em> this weekend.</p>
<h2>Spare Parts: You Can Look…</h2><div><h3>Originally Published: November 12, 2021</h3></div>
<p>Just one more day until our regular programming resumes, but as promised, I thought I’d share a few more
        souvenirs from my week on the road.</p>
<p>Let’s start at the end: Last night, Joe Grushecky and The Houserockers played a special live 25th Anniversary
        concert for their <em>American
            Babylon</em>album, streamed live on Facebook by <em>Little Steven’s Underground Garage.</em></p>
<p>Joe and the band played a scorching set, and I was grateful to catch it in person. But I was downright stunned
        when they asked me to introduce them shortly before they took the stage–stunned and honored. It was a total
        adrenaline rush to be up there on stage with the guys, and that rush lasted through the entire set. If you
        missed it, you can watch the entire performance <a href="https://fb.watch/9dC_DRlINT/">here,</a> and don’t
        forget to catch Joe and Bruce together on Apple Music this evening at 5pm Eastern.</p>
<p>The centerpiece of my trip, however, was my second visit to the Springsteen Archives at Monmouth University.
        Archives Director Eileen Chapman and student archivist Connor Rupp graciously allowed me to spend an entire day
        and assisted me in locating newspaper clippings, scrapbooks, and “mystery boxes” for new material for both the
        upcoming Year Five(!) of <em>Kingdom of Days </em>and a book I’ve started working on.</p>
<p>I left with a very nice cache of scanned and captured documents that I’ll weave into the blog in 2022, but there
        were also some fascinating undated artifacts that I thought I’d share with you here–all of which were found in a
        “mystery box” (my name, not theirs) of assorted items.</p>
<p>First up: a few pages from a teenage Bruce Springsteen’s school term paper on the New Jersey Judicial System. I
        don’t know how old Bruce was when he wrote it, but I love seeing how his handwriting looked before he’d started
        signing autographs by the the thousands. I also get a kick out of the ever-widening margins, and the way his
        teacher catches on to him by the end. The kicker is his teacher’s final remark: “Somewhat brief.” That may be
        the only time someone has ever used those words to describe Bruce’s work.</p>

<p>We’ll see more fascinating artifacts from the Springsteen Archives in next year’s <em>Kingdom of
            Days </em>series, but for now and once again: my thanks to Eileen and Connor and the entire staff for the
        important work they do and the gracious assistance they provide to researchers.</p>
<p>As this sees print, I’m in the air on my way back home. Thanks for indulging me a couple of days of “Spare Parts”
        while I traveled; regular programming resumes with <em>Roll of the Dice</em> tomorrow.</p>
<h2>Spare Parts: Mike Love and The Beach Boys: Getcha Hungry Heart Back</h2><div><h3>Originally Published: February 06, 2022</h3></div>
<p>When The Beach Boys released “Getcha Back” in 1985, more than a few people noticed that the catchy single sounded
        more than a little like an earlier hit single from the biggest rock star in the world.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CaRnRp63Aj4">Watch on Youtube: Getcha Back (Remastered 2000)</a></p>
<p>Critics and radio listeners alike noted the similarity between the Mike Love-authored hit single (it peaked at
        #25 on the Billboard Hot 100) and Bruce’s 1980 single, “Hungry Heart.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boJhWtw-6Gg">Watch on Youtube: Bruce Springsteen - Hungry Heart
            (Official Audio)</a></p>
<p>So it was almost funny when Love actually covered “Hungry Heart” for a 2007 Springsteen tribute album–the
        similarities were now unmistakable.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgex_7rQcbY">Watch on Youtube: Hungry Heart</a></p>
<p>That cover’s been on my to-blog list for years, but I’ve never been moved enough by it to bump it to the front of
        the queue. There’s nothing wrong with it, but there’s nothing particularly fresh about it either. The
        arrangement is faithful, and the performance is exactly what one would expect from Love. “Getcha Back” is
        actually a better and fresher Beach Boys arrangement for “Hungry Heart” than Mike’s attempt to cover the
        original.</p>
<p>So I’ve kept it on the “maybe someday” list.</p>
<p>And I’m glad I did, because last night I discovered this mash-up by DJ L33, and it’s <em>perfect</em>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQkvgzXZVes">Watch on Youtube: The Beach Boys - Getcha Hungry Heart Back
            (DJ L33 Remix) Mike Love, Bruce Springsteen</a></p>
<p>“Getcha Back” and “Hungry Heart” make for the best kind of mash-up: not only are the two songs musical twins,
        their lyrics are compatible as well. Framing “Getcha Back” with verses from “Hungry Heart” transforms, matures
        and even brightens both songs.</p>
<p>Mashing them up was a brilliant inspiration.</p>

<p>I don’t know who RuinedMusic2000 is, but I do know they’ve got some serious and seamless mash-up talent and a
        clever sense of humor. Who would have thought “Born to Run” would layer so perfectly on top of A-ha’s “Take On
        Me?”</p>
<p>But wait, there’s more: As great a song as it is, it’s the video that makes “Take on Me” a classic.
        RuinedMusic2000 took a crack at mashing that up too, and the result does not disappoint.</p>

<h2>Spare Parts: "Weird Al" Yankovic and Bruce Springsteen</h2><div><h3>Originally Published: May 04, 2022</h3></div>
<p>“Weird Al” Yankovic has parodied just about every iconic artist and anthem over the last four decades, but he’s
        never taken a swing at Bruce Springsteen.</p>
<p>“It’s just never worked out for me to do a straight-on Springsteen parody,” Yankovic told ScreenCrush in 2014.
        “Either the timing wasn’t right, or he didn’t have a big enough single at the time my album was coming out, or I
        just flat out couldn’t think of a clever enough idea for one of  his songs… but it’s not because he doesn’t have
        a good sense of humor. He’s got a great sense of humor.”</p>
<p>He certainly does. In fact, Bruce and Al share a certain silly sensibility, and that’s probably why they’ve
        developed an improbable friendship dating all the way back to their teens–a fact Bruce divulged in a
        surprisingly provocative and wide-ranging 1985 interview on ALTV.</p>
<p>In the clip below, Al poses a series of questions I’ve never seen any other interviewer ask, and to his credit,
        Bruce gamely answers every one of them. This is essential viewing for any Springsteen fan.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wudovyyvKDU">Watch on Youtube: "Weird Al" Yankovic - The Bruce
            Springsteen Interview</a></p>
<p>Bruce and Al are such good friends that Bruce invited Al to the set a couple of years later for the filming of
        the video for “<a href="https://estreetshuffle.com/index.php/2018/02/06/roll-of-the-dice-brilliant-disguise/">Brilliant
            Disguise</a>.” Of course, with Yankovic on the scene, hilarity was bound to ensue. In the rarely seen
        alternate and unreleased cut of Bruce’s famously somber video, we see the artist doing his best to keep a
        straight face while his buddy does his best to make him laugh. (It also includes what is to my knowledge their
        one and only musical performance together.)</p>
<p><a href="https://videopress.com/embed/5ITpyjxy">Watch Video Highlight</a></p>
<p>Bruce and Al may be besties, but that doesn’t mean they aren’t also rivals. When Bruce’s <em>Human Touch </em>and
        <em>Lucky Town</em> albums failed to hold their spots on the album charts, Springsteen enviously but
        good-naturedly name-checked his friend from the stage in his 1992 rehearsal show and radio broadcast.</p>

<p>It’s been years since Bruce and Al have been seen in public together, but a friendship like theirs was built to
        stand the test of time. Both artists are still remarkably prolific and relevant, and both are still active stage
        performers. It’s only a matter of time before we’re treated to their next collaboration.</p>
<h2>Spare Parts: Gary Frost, "Shutup Springsteen"</h2><div><h3>Originally Published: June 17, 2022</h3></div>
<p>“Shutup Springsteen” isn’t the first song inspired by a certain New Jersey rock star, but it may very well be the
        cleverest.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8hIWrKzQ9c">Watch on Youtube: Shutup Springsteen - Gary Frost (Official
            Music Video)</a></p>
<p>Released just a few hours ago by 23-year-old rising country artist (and Bruce’s neighbor) Gary Frost, “Shutup
        Springsteen” isn’t the slam you might expect from the title–it’s actually a bittersweet song of love and loss,
        and one obviously written by a fan.</p>
<p>“Springsteen’s music has always been a big part of my life,” Gary explains. “When I was writing the song I was
        thinking particularly about his love songs and what special significance they might have to people in
        relationships. Then I asked myself a question…what does the song mean when the relationship is over?</p>
<p>“Most people can relate to having a song that they consider ‘our song’. The song starts playing, you immediately
        start smiling and thinking of your special someone, maybe you are singing along and it’s such a great feeling.
        Unfortunately after a breakup the same song still stirs up feelings and not the good kind. That’s how I got the
        idea for “Shutup Springsteen.”</p>
<p>Gary’s song may be sad, but it’s also sly. Listen carefully to catch Bruce’s song titles (and not just his hits)
        interwoven throughout. Frost even co-opts the riff from Bruce’s 1984 pop hit “Dancing in the
        Dark” and transforms it into the anchor for his new country single.</p>
<p>I mentioned that Frost and Springsteen are neighbors, but Gary’s Springsteen connections reach back generations:
        his grandfather worked at Slattery’s Gas Station in Freehold next door to Bruce’s childhood home. “My
        grandfather would give Bruce quarters for the cigarette machine, and when he was outside playing his guitar
        squirt him with a garden hose.”</p>
<p>“Shutup Springsteen” is available now on Spotify and YouTube. If you find yourself in New Jersey this summer,
        catch one of Gary’s many area appearances. You can find his tour schedule and more music <a href="https://www.garyfrostcountry.com/">here</a>.</p>

<h2>A Very Springsteen Christmas</h2><div><h3>Originally Published: January 01, 2002</h3></div>
<p>You’d think the guy with one of the best-selling Christmas singles of all time would have released at least one
        Christmas album by now. And yet, here we are: fifty holiday seasons into his recording career, and we’re still
        waiting for a Bruce Springsteen Christmas album.</p>
<p>As it turns out, there’s a reason for that. Bruce was refreshingly candid about it when he spoke with Jimmy
        Fallon on <em>The Tonight Show</em> in 2020:</p>
<p><a href="https://videopress.com/embed/EDabM958">Watch Video Highlight</a></p>
<p>But if we have to keep waiting and wishing for a Springsteen holiday album, at least there’s no shortage of live
        Springsteen performances of holiday classics… if you know where to look for them.</p>
<p>As it turns out, you can look right here.</p>
<p>Each song title in the guided tour below links to a full essay I wrote sometime over the past five years. Check
        them out to explore backstories, compare original versions, and enjoy some of Bruce’s best performances over the
        years.</p>
<h3><strong>Early Rock and Roll Holiday Hits</strong></h3>
<p>Bruce is especially fond of Christmas classics from the golden age of rock and roll–half of the songs in our
        Springsteen holiday jukebox date back to the 1950s (or earlier).</p>
<ul>
<li>Chuck Berry’s 1958 “Run
            Rudolph Run” marries the red-nosed reindeer to “Little Queenie”,
            another Springsteen favorite. Check out the surprising link between the two and enjoy Bruce’s great
            performances with Jon Bon Jovi, Bobby Bandiera, The Max Weinberg 7, and more.</li>
<li>“Blue Christmas”
            dates back even further, although it’s the 1957 Elvis Presley version that earned it perennial status.
            Listen to the original versions along with three terrific Springsteen performances (including one very
            poignant one).</li>
<li>Don’t call “Jingle Bell
            Rock” an oldie. The 1957 single (notice how many holiday favorites debuted in the late fifties)
            continues to grow in popularity, peaking at #3 on the Hot 100 as recently as 2020. Bruce welcomed audiences
            with it during his 2001 holiday shows, and you can listen to those performances by clicking the link above.
        </li>
<li>“Santa Claus Baby” is a deep holiday cut. Mostly forgotten today, the 1955 holiday heartbreak song by The
            Voices got a swinging rock treatment from Bruce, Jimmy Vivino and The Max Weinberg 7 in 2001.</li>
<li>Another holiday obscurity: the 1961 B-side “Christmas
            Day” by Detroit Junior. Watch Bruce unleash his inner Killer at the piano when he joins Vivino and
            The Max Weinberg 7 on stage in 2003.</li>
<li>Sneaking in at the tail end of rock’s golden age is Darlene Love’s 1963 holiday favorite, “Christmas
            (Baby Please Come Home)”, named the Greatest Rock and Roll Christmas Song of All Time by <em>Rolling
                Stone. </em>Bruce performed it at each and every holiday show from 2000 to 2003. Check out the essay to
            catch Bruce performing it with Jon Bon Jovi, Little Steven, Southside Johnny, Jesse Malin, Willie Nile, and
            more.</li>

<p>It isn’t Christmas without carols, and even Springsteen has been known to enjoy a holiday chestnut from time to
        time.</p>
<ul>
<li>“Joy to the World” is the oldest song in our holiday jukebox–it dates back more then three centuries.
            Check out the earliest known recording (from 1926!) and watch Bruce sing it with Sting, James Taylor, Ronnie
            Spector, Darlene Love, and other luminaries at Sting and Trudie Styler’s Rainforest Fund benefit in 2016.
        </li>
<li>You <em>think</em> it’s a Christmas carol, but “Do
            You Hear What I Hear” is actually a cold war protest song about nuclear annihilation. (You’re
            welcome.) Listeners glommed on to the Christian imagery, however, and it became a favorite (if
            misunderstood) holiday standard. Watch Bruce perform with that same 2016 all-star line-up.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Springsteen Singles</strong></h3>
<p>No Springsteen holiday collection could be complete without Bruce’s own two immensely popular holiday covers.</p>
<ul>
<li>“Merry Christmas, Baby” dates back to 1947, but it was Otis Redding’s 1968 version that influenced Bruce’s
            1986
            B-side. It’s popped up in Springsteen’s set lists with regularity ever since 1980, and there are many
            wonderful filmed performances to enjoy if you click the link above.</li>
<li>And of course: Bruce’s original and perennial Christmas cover, “Santa
            Claus Is Comin’ to Town.” The backstory is tragic, but the track is timeless. So is Bruce’s version,
            which pops up on your FM dial with regularity each and every December. Watch some of Bruce’s best seasonal
            (and off-seasonal) performances here.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Christmas Comedy</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>“Pilgrim in the Temple of Love” is the lone Springsteen original on our holiday list. This ribald 1996
            holiday fable has a lot to say, even though Bruce says it with tongue firmly in cheek. It’s well worth
            checking out, but I wouldn’t recommend listening at work or with kids around.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope you enjoy this brief guided tour through Bruce’s best holiday-themed performances. Have a great holiday
        season, and let’s hope we all get a little closer to peace on earth soon.</p>
